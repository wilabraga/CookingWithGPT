      Title: HAZELNUT CHERRY TART
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Plain flour
    1/8 ts Salt
      2 oz Hazelnuts, roasted
           -ground
      2 tb Sugar
      2 oz Butter
      1    Egg yolk
      2 ts Water

MMMMM----------------------CUSTARD FILLING---------------------------
      4    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
  1 3/4 c  Cream
      3 ts Gelatine
      2 tb Water

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      2 lb Cherries, canned
      2 ts Gelatine
      2 ts Rum (see note)
 
  MAKE PASTRY:  Sift flour and add all dry ingredients together, with
  the sugar in the centre, on a pastry board. Add the butter
  (softened), egg yolk and water. Work the liquids into the sugar,
  until it is creamy.
  
  Now work in the flour mixture, as you would for any sweet pastry.
  Press the dough into a greased 9-inch flan tin. Prick the base of the
  pastry all over. Refrigerate for 30 mins, then cook in a moderate
  oven (375 degrees F.) for 15 to 20 mins (until golden brown)
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Put egg yolks, sugar and vanilla into a bowl and beat
  until thick and creamy.  Heat cream carefully until almost boiling.
  
  Combine the two mixtures, beating until smooth, then add the result
  to the top of a double boiler and simmer until it thickens (STIR
  CONSTANTLY).
  
  Dissolve the gelatine in the water and add to the cream mixture,
  stirring well until it is well mixed. Allow this mixture to cool
  completely before adding to the pastry case. Refrigerate until it
  sets.
  
  MAKE TOPPING:  Drain the cherries and reserve about 1 cup of the
  syrup. We don't use commercial canned cherries. I would suggest a
  "light" syrup. Arrange the pitted cherries artistically over the top
  of the tart.
  
  Put the reserved syrup, gelatine and rum (we usually use cherry
  brandy or kirsch) into a saucepan and heat (stirring) until gelatine
  dissolves. Cool the liquid and pour over the cherries. Refrigerate
  until set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A thoroughly decadent desert -- This has simply got to be the best
  dessert you'll ever try. My wife has made this one many times. The
  only complaint ever lodged is that there was not enough.
  
  *  Don't be put off by the complexity of the recipe; it is well worth
  the effort.
  
  *  All the egg whites "wasted" can be used in something else, such as
  a Pavlova.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  several hours preparation, cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients carefully.

      Title: HAZELNUT CREPES WITH COFFEE ICE CREAM - GLORI
 Categories: Crs96, Makebooze, Makegift
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Whole hazelnuts
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Brewed coffee, cooled
    1/3 c  Frangelico and/or kahlua
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/8 ts Almond extract
      3    Eggs
      1 c  Flour
      3 tb Unsalted butter, melted and
           Cooled
           Oil for pan
      1 pt Coffee ice cream
           Caramel coffee nut sauce*
           And/or
           Mocha fudge sauce*
 
  *Separate recipes in this series.
  
  To toast hazelnuts:
  
  Bake in a 300F. oven, shaking several times, until skins darken,
  loosen and crack, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly, transfer to a
  towel. Fold towel to encase, rub vigorously to loosen the skins.
  Remove and discard as much of the skin as possible.
  
  Transfer skins to blender or food processor. Pulse on/off until finely
  chopped.
  
  Crepes: Combine milk, Frangelico, vanilla and almond extracts and eggs
  until blended. Add flour al at once and beat until smooth and all of
  the flour has been absorbed. Beat in the hazelnuts, butter and sugar.
  Cover and refrigerate at least two hours, but preferably overnight.
  
  Return batter to room temperature.
  
  Heat crepe pan until water spits across. Lightly oil and heat until
  hot. Remove pan from heat, pour in 1/4 cup batter and swirl quickly
  to coat bottom. Return pan to heat.
  
  Cook until crepe is golden brown on bottom; turn and cook other side.
  Transfer to plate, separating crepes with waxed paper. Repeat with
  remaining batter, oiling pan as needed.
  
  The crepes can be prepared to this point ahead of time. Rewarm by
  removing waxed paper, wrapping in tin foil and baking in a preheated
  350F. oven on a cookie sheet for about 15 minutes.
  
  Quickly roll warm crepes around small scoops of ice cream. Serve with
  one or both of the sauces.

    1/2 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Brewed coffee, cooled
    1/3 c  Frangelico and/or kahlua
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/8 ts Almond extract
      3    Eggs
      1 c  Flour
      3 tb Unsalted butter, melted and
           Cooled

           Caramel coffee nut sauce*
           And/or
           Mocha fudge sauce*
 
  *Separate recipes in this series.
  
  To toast hazelnuts:
  
  Bake in a 300F. oven, shaking several times, until skins darken,
  loosen and crack, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly, transfer to a
  towel. Fold towel to encase, rub vigorously to loosen the skins.
  Remove and discard as much of the skin as possible.
  
  Transfer skins to blender or food processor. Pulse on/off until finely
  chopped.
  
  Crepes: Combine milk, Frangelico, vanilla and almond extracts and eggs
  until blended. Add flour al at once and beat until smooth and all of
  the flour has been absorbed. Beat in the hazelnuts, butter and sugar.
  Cover and refrigerate at least two hours, but preferably overnight.
  
  Return batter to room temperature.
  
  Heat crepe pan until water spits across. Lightly oil and heat until
  hot. Remove pan from heat, pour in 1/4 cup batter and swirl quickly
  to coat bottom. Return pan to heat.
  
  Cook until crepe is golden brown on bottom; turn and cook other side.
  Transfer to plate, separating crepes with waxed paper. Repeat with
  remaining batter, oiling pan as needed.
  
  The crepes can be prepared to this point ahead of time. Rewarm by
  removing waxed paper, wrapping in tin foil and baking in a preheated
  350F. oven on a cookie sheet for about 15 minutes.
  
  Quickly roll warm crepes around small scoops of ice cream. Serve with
  one or both of the sauces.

      Title: HAZELNUT MERINGUE WITH MOCHA FILLING
 Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Hazelnuts or almonds, ground
      2 tb Cornstarch
  1 1/2 c  Sugar, fine granulated
      8    Egg whites
      2 ts Lemon juice
 
  A light, luscious hazelnut meringue cake with chocolate-coffee
  filling is a dream dessert after a buffer. To make a taller cake pipe
  three 8-inch circles and fill as directed. This looks spectacular but
  is harder to cut. Preheat oven to 225F (110C). Line 2 baking sheets
  with parchment paper or foil. Draw a 10-inch circle on each sheet.
  Turn sheet over so pencil will not come off on meringue. Combine
  hazelnut and cornstarch making sure there are no lumps. Place egg
  whites in bowl of electric beater and whisk until soft peaks form.
  Gradually sprinkle in sugar, beating until stiff peaks form and
  mixture is glossy. Beat in lemon juice. Sprindle nut mixture over the
  whites and quickly fold in. Either gently spread or pipe meringue
  into the two circles. Place in oven and bake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours,
  until meringue is dry but not coloured. Cool on baking sheet. Remove
  from parchment paper and store at room temperature in an airtight tin
  for up to three weeks. MOCHA FILLING: Stir together coffee and Kahlua
  until coffee is dissolved. Beat whipping cream until it thickens and
  holds its shape. Beat in icing sugar and sifted cocoa. Add coffee
  mixture and beat until cream is stiff. Do not overbeat; cream should
  be thick and smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. To assemble,
  spread half of cream on one layer. Top with second layer and
  remainder of cream. Decorate with chocolate curls, chocolate coated
  coffee beans or spread a doily on cream and sifted cocao over.

    1/2 c  -Water
 
  Preheat the oven to 250 F.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment
  paper and trace a 10-inch circle onto each piece of parchment. Finely
  grate the toasted hazelnuts (a rotary nut grater works best) into a
  bowl. Sift in 3/4 cup of the confectioners' sugar and toss to mix
  thoroughly.
  
  In a large bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on low speed
  until foamy, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to high and beat
  until the whites nearly double in volume and stiff peaks form.
  Gradually beat in the granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat
  until the whites are dense and glossy and form stiff peaks. With a
  large rubber spatula, lightly fold in the nut mixture until no white
  streaks remain.
  
  Use a tiny amount of the nut meringue to anchor the corners of the
  parchment to the baking sheet. Spoon half of the meringue onto one of
  the circles and, with a thin metal spatula, spread into an even layer
  to fill the circle.  Form a second circle with the remaining meringue
  on the other baking sheet.
  
  Bake the nut mixture in the upper and lower thirds of the oven,
  switching positions once, until lightly browned and crisp throughout
  when tapped, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. The amount of time it takes to dry out
  will depend on the humidity of the day.  Let cool to room
  temperature. (The recipe can be prepared to this point up to 2 days
  ahead.) Wrap the meringue layers, with the parchment still attached
  to the bottom (for stability), in a large sheet of foil to seal.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE THE DESSERT:  Peel off the parchment paper from the
  meringue layers.  Set one layer on a flat surface and spread evenly
  with 2 cups of the (room temperature) Hazelnut Praline Buttercream.
  Place the second layer, flat-side up, on top of the buttercream and
  press gently. With a metal spatula, spread the remaining buttercream
  evenly on the top and sides of the cake.
  
  To decorate, press the Hazelnut Praline around the sides of the cake
  and sift the remaining 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar evenly over the
  top or use stencils to create a design. Garnish with the whole
  hazelnuts. Refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour, or up to 24
  hours to firm up. Serve chilled.
  
  HAZELNUT PRALINE BUTTERCREAM: In a small heavy saucepan, combine the
  sugar with the water.  Bring to a boil over moderately high heat,
  stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil without stirring until the syrup
  reaches the soft-ball stage, 244 degrees F on a candy thermometer,
  about 6 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the egg yolks and whole egg on high speed
  until pale, fluffy and quadrupled in volume, about 5 minutes.
  
  Gradually beat the boiling syrup into the eggs in a thin steady
  stream. Beat until the mixture cools to room temperature, 6 to 8
  minutes.
  
  Gradually beat in the butter, 4 tablespoons at a time, and continue
  to beat until the buttercream is fluffy.
  
  Fold in the Hazelnut Praline.  Use at once or cover and refrigerate
  overnight.  Remove from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before
  using, to return to room temperature. (Makes about 3-2/3 cups)
  
  HAZELNUT PRALINE:  Lightly oil a baking sheet and place the nuts in a
  single-layer in the middle of the tray.
  
  In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar with the water. Bring to a
  boil over moderately high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil
  without stirring until the sugar turns golden, about 10 minutes.
  
  Drizzle the boiling caramel over the nuts and set aside until hard and
  cool, about 20 minutes.
  
  Break the nuts and caramel into chunks by hitting the bottom of the
  tray. Grind to a powder in a food processor, about 20 seconds. Use at
  once or store in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks. (Makes about
    2-1/4    cups)

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Liver, chopped
      2 tb Butter
      4 sm Carrots, diced
    1/2 c  Celery, diced
      1 lg Onion, thinly sliced
      2 c  Hot water
      1 tb Sugar
      1 c  Fresh or frozen spinach
     20 oz Can Tomatoes
 
      Salt and Pepper to taste
  
   Stir cook the liver in butter.Add remaining ingredients.Stir well.
   Cook covered (25 min in microwave).  This soup freezes and reheats
  very well.
  
   This will take some experimenting but I could make it at the same
  time as a stir fry and freeze the soup in plastic ice cube trays
  instead of freezing half the package of raw liver.
  
  Have you tried it using a creamed soup?
  
  I'm not all that fond of cooked tomatoes, but it looks like it might
  be good using something like cream of Cheddar...
  
  Also... were you using beef or chicken or what?
  
  Also... how about some diced potatoes...?
  
  OTOH...  Let's eliminate the butter and use bacon... Turns it into a
  chowder...

      Title: HEALTHY WAFFLES
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Rolled oats (can be toasted
           First by putting thin layer
           In pan
           And baking at 350 degrees
           For 15-20 minutes, or until
           Lightly toasted)
      1 pk RapidRise yeast
      1 tb Sugar
      3 tb Oat bran
      2 tb Nonfat dry milk powder
    1/2 c  Cornmeal
    3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      3 tb Wheat germ
 
  Mix above ingredients in a large bowl. Heat ingredients below until
  very warm (125-130 degrees) and stir into the dry mixture.
  
  3/4 cup skim milk 2 egg whites 1/4 cup dark molasses
  
  Let the batter sit for about 20 minutes, or overnight in the
  refrigerator. You may want to add more milk or water to get them to
  the consistency you like, depending on whether you're going to turn
  them into waffles or pancakes.  I have varied the dry ingredients
  radically, depending on what I have around the house. When I don't
  have molasses, I increase the amount of honey and other liquids. No
  matter what I do to this recipe, it always seems to turn out great.
  
  I estimate the fat grams per 7" x 7" waffle to be <3 grams, which can
  vary depending on the grains you use.

      1 c  Rose hips
    1/2 c  Diced dried pitted cherries
    1/4 c  Crumbled dried orange peel
      2    Cinnamon sticks

      Title: HEARTY BEAN & VEGETABLE STEW
 Categories: Soup, Crockpot, Vegetarian, Ornish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 lb Beans, assorted, dry
      2 c  Vegetable juice
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
    1/3 c  Apple or pineapple juice
           -vegetable stock or water
    1/2 c  Celery  diced
    1/2 c  Parsnips  diced
    1/2 c  Carrots  diced
    1/2 c  Mushrooms  diced
      1    Onion  diced
      1 ts Basil, dried
      1 ts Parsley, dried
      1    Bay leaf
      3    Clove garlic  minced
      1 ts Black pepper  ground
      1 c  Rice or pasta  cooked
 
  Sort and rinse beans, then soak overnight in water. Drain beans and
  place in crockpot.  Add vegetable juice, wine, soy sauce, and apple
  or pineapple juice. Cover with vegetable stock or water; the amount
  added depends on whether you prefer a soup (more liquid) or a stew
  (less). The juice adds just a tad of sweetness and the soy sauce adds
  depth and the tang of salt. Cook at high for 2 hours.  Add
  vegetables, herbs, and spices, and cook for 5-6 hours at low until
  carrots and parsnips are tender. When tender, add rice or pasta and
  cook for one additional hour. Notes: For beans use 3 or 4 kinds, such
  as: black, red kidney, pinto, baby lima, lentil, and green and/or
  yellow split peas.

      Title: HEARTY BRISKET FROM "THE ONLY TEXAS COOKBOOK"
 Categories: Brisket, Beef, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      8 lb Brisket (8 to 10 lb)
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
      1 tb Molasses
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      1 ts Peppercorns
      1 tb Salt
      5    Cloves garlic, minced
      2    Onions, minced fine
      2    Stalks celery, minced fine
           Pepper, coarsely ground
 
  Make a marinade of wine, molasses, soy sauce, peppercorns, salt
  garlic, onions, and celery. (You can put onions and celery in
  processor until almost pureed.) Lay the boned and trimmed brisket on
  a large piece of heavy- duty foil and spread the marinade over all
  surfaces. Wrap the brisket tightly. Place in refrigerator and
  marinate for 24 hours. Open foil and sprinkle the brisket generously
  with freshly milled pepper. Reseal, place in a large open roasting
  pan (or jelly roll pan). Place in a 200-deg oven and cook for 8
  hours. Remove from oven. Rewrap the meat in a clean sheet of foil.
  Reserve pan juices and serve with warm meat. Good hot or cold on
  sandwiches. Serves 20 ...............................................
  Cooking a brisket recalls an elementary law of physics. What happens
  to water at 212-deg? It boils away. By cooking a brisket at 200-deg.
  all the inherent juices are saved and the meat is made more tender
  than you ever imagined. It is important that the cooking sack be
  completely sealed--a good method is to use what is called a drugstore
  wrap. Here's what you do. You'll probably notice that a brisket is
  too wide to seal in one width of foil, so you will need to seal 4
  sides. Here's how: Tear off 2 large equal lengths of foil. Lay 1 on
  top of the other. Now fold 1 side over twice, making a narrow
  1/2-inch double fold. Open out the 2 sheets, and you'll have a good
  seal on the bottom. Lay the meat on top of the seam. Coat all
  surfaces with the marinade. Now life the 2 remaining sides of foil up
  and, holding them even with each other, fold over and over in
  1/2-inch folds until you have a tight package. Press fold flat
  against the meat. This is what should be touching all surfaces of the
  meat snugly. You just have to be careful not to puncture it during
  the cooking and handling process. When I cook this brisket, I do the
  whole thin after supper. The first night I make the marinade and
  place meat in the refrigerator; the next night I put it in the oven
  just before going to bed. By morning it is cooked to a turn. A good
  working woman's scheme. You can eat this for several days without
  screaming.

 Categories: Diabetic, Breadmaker
      Yield: 32 Servings
 
  5 1/4 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 c  Flour (use as needed)
      1 ts Salt
  2 1/4 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Margarine or butter
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2    Envelopes active dry yeast
           OR
      2 tb Active dry yeast
      2 c  Quick cooking oats
      1 tb Caraway seeds
 
  The number of slices used to calculate the recipe was not given or
  checked. Guessed about 16 half-inch slices per loaf to make 32
  servings.
  
  Stir together 2 cups of flour and the salt in a large bowl. Heat the
  milk, margarine and sugar together over low heat until the margarine
  is soft. Add the liquid to the flour. Beat for 2 minutes on the
  medium speed of an electric mixer or 300 strokes by hand.
  
  Combine 1 cup of flour and the yeast.  Add to the batter. Beat for 2
  minutes on medium speed or 300 strokes by hand. Stir in the oats and
  caraway with a wooden spoon. Stir in enough additional flour to make a
  stiff dough.
  
  Turn out onto a floured board.  Knead until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes.
  Place in a greased large bowl.  Brush the top with vegetable oil.
  Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until
  double in size, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch the dough down.  Divide it in half and shape to form two loaves.
  Place in two greased 8 1/2 " x 4 1/2 " loaf pans. Brush with melted
  margarine or butter. Cover and let rise until nearly double in size,
  about 1 hour.  When almost doubled, preheat the oven to 375 F. Bake
  for about 40 minutes or until brown.  Cool before slicing. Makes 2
  loaves.

      Title: HEARTY ROASTED VEGETABLES
 Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 lb Onions
      1 lb Rutabagas
      1 lb Potatoes
      1 lb Carrots
      1 lb Parsnips
      1 c  Vegetable oil
    1/3 c  Lemon pepper
      2 tb Salt, or to taste
 
  Peel and cut onions in large wedges. Peel and cut rutabagas into
  thumb-size chunks. Scrub and cut potatoes into thumb-size chunks.
  Peel and cut both carrots and parsnips into 1/2"-thick diagonal
  chunks.
  
  In a large bowl toss cut veggies with lemon pepper and salt. If you're
  using a lemon pepper blend with the salt in it, omit the extra salt.
  
  Spread on baking sheets in single layer.  It helps to line the baking
  sheets with parchment paper.
  
  Roast at 425 degrees for 35 to 50 minutes, till golden brown and
  tender. Serve hot.
  
  Rutabagas are members of the turnip family and are frequently
  referred to as yellow turnips.  Parsnips are sometimes referred to as
  white carrots, but they are not carrots. Both are vegetables commonly
  found in American markets in the fall.  You can use this method with
  most any firm vegetable that normally takes a few minutes to
  boil/steam cook: green beans work very well here, as do various other
  root vegetables.

      Title: HEATHER'S ROASTED CURRY POWDER
 Categories: Ceylon, Condiment
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Ground cumin
      2 tb Fennel seeds
      3 tb Coriander powder
     25    Curry leaves *
     10    Cardamom pods, crushed
      6    Whole cloves
      1 tb Ground black pepper
      6    One-inch pieces rampa **
      3    One-inch pieces cinnamon
           -stick
      1 tb Dried, crushed red chilies
      1 tb Mustard seeds
 
  Start with a large pan, and dry-roast the ingredients separately over
  low to medium heat, roasting the mustard seds last. In a few minutes,
  the mustard seeds will start to pop (keep the lid on the pan or the
  mustard seeds will fly out). Then stir in the coriander and cumin;
  when the spices; when the spices begin to turn light brown, add the
  rest of the ingredients. Since the curry powder mix can burn very
  quickly, stir it continuously. Roast the spices for about 7 to 10
  minutes, until they are dark golden brown.  Then remove them from the
  heat, and grind or powder them immediately while they are still warm
  (whether you do it by hand with a mortar and pestle or in a food
  processor, the must be FINELY ground). Store in an airtight bottle -
  keeps well for two weeks or more.
  
  *Curry leaves - edible gray-green leaves that resemble bay leaf, used
  in flavoring sambols and fish, vegetable, or meat curries. The Sri
  Lankans use curry leaves fresh, but they can be used dried if fresh
  leaves are not available.  The Sinhalese term for the plant is
  'karapincha', and if you can find them fresh, they add great depth
  and flavor to a dish. They are not removed before serving, and they
  are edible. There is no substitute for curry leaves.
  
  **Rampa (pandanus leaf) - Spear shaped aromatic leaves used to flavor
  curries.  From the lemongrass family, rampa is not edible, but it is
  used as a flavoring in boiling rice. Sri Lankans do not remove it
  before serving; they just leave it on the plate.

      Title: HEAVEN & HELL CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
           Angel food:
    2/3 c  Cake flour
      1 c  Confectioners sugar
      1 c  Egg whites (7 or 8)
           Pinch of salt
      1 ts Cream of tartar
    2/3 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Almond extract
           Devil's food:
    1/2 c  Powdered cocoa
      1 c  Strong coffee
    1/2 c  Shortening
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Cake flour
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking poweder
      1 ts Baking soda
           Peanut butter mousse
           (recipe follows)
           Ganache
           (recipe follows)
 
  To make the angel food: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Cut parchment paper
  or wax paper to fit the bottom of a 10 inch round cake pan. Do not
  grease the pan or paper.
  
  Sift together the flour and confectioner's sugar.  Set aside.
  
  Place egg whites in bowl of a heavy duty mixer.  Beat slowly while
  adding the salt and cream of tartar; then continue beating for 1
  minute or until soft peak form. Increase speed to medium ; add sugar
  by Tablespooons until it is all incorporated, then beat 1 1/2 minutes
  longer. When egg whites have stiff peaks, add vanilla and almond
  extracts.
  
  Remove bowl from mixer and sprinkle half of the confectioners'
  sugar-flour mixture over the egg whites. Fold in with a rubber
  spatula; sprinkle with remaining with remaining sugar-flour mixture
  and fold again using a minimum number of strokes so that the egg
  white do not deflate. Gently spoon the mixture into prepared pan and
  bake 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden brown. Do not overbake or the
  cake will sink in the center.
  
  To make the devil's food:  Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour
  a round 10-inch cake pan.
  
  Sift cocoa into a mixing bowl, then drizzle in the coffee while
  whisking to make a smooth paste.  Set aside.
  
  Combine shortening, sugar, vanilla and eggs, and beat for 2 minutes at
  medium speed.
  
  In a separate bowl, sift togethr the flour, salt, baking powder and
  baking soda.
  
  Alternately add the cocoa-coffee mixture and flour mixture to the
  sugar-egg mixture and continue beating until incorporated. Pour
  batter into prepared pan and bake for 30 minutes.
  
  To assemble cake:  When both cakes have cooled, carefully slice them
  in half horizontally with a sharp serrated knife (the longer the
  better) so that you have 4 cake layers.
  
  To slice the angel food cake, spray knife with oil. Holding the top
  of the cake with your flat open hand, use a sawing action to slice
  through. Do not put pressure on the knife or the cake might tear;
  just let the sawwing action do its work. (If the cake sinks in the
  center, fill it in with some extra mousse.  Make this the top layer
  and it will be easier to level off)
  
  Place 1 layer on the devil's food cake on a plate and spoon a third
  of the Peanut Butter Mousse on top.  Add a layer of the devil's food
  cake on a plate and spoon a third of the Peanut Butter Mousse on top.
  Add a layer of the angel food , then spread with another third of the
  mousse. Add second devil's food layer, then reamining mouse. Top with
  remaining angel food layer.
  
  Whisk the Ganache, then spread over the cake with a spaaatual,
  frosting the top and sides generously. Refrigerate for a least 2
  hours before serving. Served chilled, slice with a warm wet knife.

  simmer 15 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed. Add
  milk, sugar, and chocolate to rice mixture; simmer over low heat
  stirring occasionally until thickened, about 30 minutes. Soften
  gelatin in cold water.  Add to thickened chocolate mixture. Stir
  well. Remove from heat. Place pan with mixture in bowl of ice water
  to cool. Whip cream and remaining vanilla at low speed until soft
  peaks form. Increase speed to high. Gradually add powdered sugar,
  continue beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold half of whipped cream
  into cooled rice mixture. Add coffee liqueur to remaining whipped
  cream. Spoon rice mixture into dessert glasses; top with remaining
  whipped cream and sprinkle with chocolate sprinkles.  Refrigerate
  until set.

      Title: HEAVENLY CHOCOLATE--GOGUL MOGUL
 Categories: Desert
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    Eggs (separated)
      1 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/3 ts Salt
      2    Or 3 drops vanilla
    1/3 ts Cream of tartar
           Cocoa according to pkg
           -instructions
 
  Prepare cocoa according to package instructions.  Have eggs at room
  temperature.  Add salt and cream of tartar to egg whites and beat
  until mixture forms rounding peaks. Beat in 1/2 cup sugar, a
  tablespoon at a time and continue beating until the sugar is
  dissolved and the mixture forms glossy pointed peaks (takes about 10
  minutes). Add the vanilla and continue beating 2 to 3 minutes longer.
  
  Beat the egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, a tablespoon at a
  time, until its heavy and thick enough to float on top of the cocoa.
  (This will also require about 10 minutes of beating time.) Place the
  yolk mixture on top of the cocoa and top with the egg white mixture.
  You will need to use a spoon first before you can drink this. On a
  cold wintry night it is suggest you might wish to add some cognac to
  the cocoa.
  
  I might also suggest dusting the top of the egg white with nutmeg or
  cinnamon.  Elegant!

           Black pepper
           Parsley; to finish
 
  *Note: Neck of mutton may be either whole or in chops (use lamb only
  if you have to).
  
  Start to cook this dish the day before serving.  Boil the neck of
  mutton in a large covered pan in 2-1/2 pints lightly salted water for
  2 hours (or more if the meat needs it). Skim off all the scum and the
  excess fat as it rises to the surface of the water.
  
  Take out the meet when it is tender.  Put in the barley and leave it
  soaking in the stock overnight. Next day, bring the stock and barley
  back to the boil. Prepare and dice all the vegetables except the
  leeks to the stock and cook for another 60 minutes.  Add the leeks,
  cut into fine rings, 10 minutes before the end of cooking.
  
  If you want to have the meat in the stew, strip it off the bones, cut
  into small pieces and return it to the soup before reheating
  thoroughly.
  
  Put a tablespoon of parsley in each plate, and pour in the soup. If
  you prefer a two-dish meal, serve the meat as a main course
  afterwards with potatoes - Golden Wonder are Chrissie's preferred
  variety. Bake the potatoes if they are mature.  Or boil them in their
  jackets if they are new.  For really fluffy, floury boiled potatoes,
  Chrissie cooks hers whole and unpeeled (never cut a Golden Wonder)
  for 12-15 minutes, depending on average size.  Then drain out all but
  a little of the water, lid the pan tightly and steam the potatoes for
  another 10 or 15 minutes, shaking regularly, until they are dry and
  floury in texture.

      Title: HELEN'S PUMPKIN PUDDING
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Browned, strained pumpkin
      2 tb All purpose flour
      1 c  Brown sugar
      2 c  Milk
      1 c  Carnation 2% canned milk
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ginger
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
      2    Eggs, beaten
 
  This recipe calls for browned pumpkin which is accomplished by
  buttering a heavy cast iron frying pan and cooking the 2 cups pumpkin
  over medium heat, stirring and turning so all parts dry properly.
  Keep this up til it is reduced to 1 1/2 cups.  It will be slightly
  browned.
  
  Place the browned pumpkin in a bowl, sprinkle with flour and brown
  sugar and stir til thoroughly mixed. Add spices and eggs and beat
  well. Scald milk.  Add the canned milk to scalded milk. Add milks to
  pumpkin mixture Beat together til well mixed.
  
  Place mixture in a greased casserole and place it in a larger
  casserole with hot water that comes half way up the outside of inner
  casserole. Place in a 325 F oven and oven poach til a knife comes out
  clean when tested. Serve hot or cold.
  
  This is actually my pumpkin pie filling, but I prefer it without the
  pastry and it is better for me.  No great amount of fat in this one.

  Let the package come to room temperature before opening it. The
  sheets are easier to work with at room temperature.
  
  Remove the sheets you are working with and spray or brush them with
  oil, butter or nonstick cooking spray as quickly as possible. Keep
  the unused portions covered with a towel or plastic wrap. Work
  quickly; do not expose reserved sheets to the air or they will dry
  out and disintegrate.
  
  Sprinkle bread crumbs between the layers to keep them from sticking
  together when they bake; this is particularly helpful if you plan to
  refrigerate or freeze the recipe before baking.
  
  Some cooks work on a lightly dampened towel, but I find it makes the
  dough soggy.

 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Green onions, chopped OR
    1/4 c  Freeze-dried chives
      1 tb Chopped parsley OR
           Dried parsley flakes
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Pepper
      6    Whole cleaned trout
           (each about 8 oz.)
           Seasoned salt
      6    Strips bacon
    1/2 c  Baking mix (biscuit mix)
      2 tb Yellow cornmeal
           Lemon wedges (optional)
 
   Combine green onions, parsley, lemon juice, and pepper. Sprinkle
  trout cavities with salt, then spread each with onion mixture.
  
   In a wide frying pan over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp. Remove
  bacon from pan and drain.  Leave 2 or 3 TBS. of the drippings in pan
  and reserve remaining drippings.
  
   Combine baking mix and cornmeal on a piece of wax paper. Coat trout
  on both sides with mixture. Arrange half the trout in pan. Cook,
  turning once, until fish is lightly browned and flakes readily when
  prodded in thickest portion with a fork.  For a 1-inch thick fish
  (measured in thickest portion), allow 10 minutes total - 5 minutes on
  each side. (Allow same ratio of thickness to time - 1 inch: 10
  minutes - for fish of all thicknesses.)
  
   Cook remaining fish in reserved drippings.  Slip a bacon strip into
  cavity of each fish.  Garnish with lemon wedges, if desired. Serves 6.

 Categories: Beverages, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Shots strawberry schnapps
    1/2    Shot Bailey's
      1 ds Grenadine
 
  Pour the schnapps into a lowball glass.  Then pour Bailey's right
  into the middle and then the grenadine (it's just a dash of red color
  to look like blood). If poured correctly the Bailey's clumps together
  in the bottom of the glass looking like (you guessed it!) a brain
  (sort of). The grenadine is the "hemorrhage."

      Yield: 14 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
      1 c  Milk
      2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 ts Salt

      2 c  Cottage cheese (16 oz)
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Unsalted butter; melted
      1 ts Vanilla
    3/4 ts Salt
      3    Large eggs
           Unsalted butter; melted
      1    Egg; lightly beaten
 
  To make batter, put the eggs, milk, oil, and salt in a blender
  container. Blend well. Add the flour and blend until just combined,
  scraping down the sides once.
   Brush and 8-inch frying pan with melted butter.  Pour in 2 to 3
  Tbsp. of batter, tilting the pan so the batter flows to coat the
  bottom. Use just enough batter to make a thin pancake. Cook until the
  edges begin to turn golden.  Shake the pan to loosen the pancake.
  Quickly turn the pancake out onto a paper towel, browned side up.
  Repeat with the remaining butter and batter, stacking the cooked
  pancakes between sheets of paper towel. Combine all the ingredients
  for the filling in a mixing bowl. Arrange a pancake, browned side up,
  and place a  heaping spoonful of filling just above the center.  Fold
  the sides toward the middle, overlapping the edges. Fold down the top
  to seal in the filling, then roll the pancake to make a neat little
  packet. Arrange the blintzes, seam side down, on a heated griddle or
  in a large skillet brushed with butter. Cook until browned, turning
  once. Makes 14 to 18 blintzes. From The Brooklyn Cookbook by

  This recipe was one of Henry Ford's favorite snacks. The recipe was
  found in Cooking For Henry, a cookbook by Henry Ford's personal party
  chef, Jan Willemse. In 1934, Mr. Ford requested Willemse experiment
  in cooking with soybeans, and the cookbook has an entire chapter
  dedicated to soybean recipes.
  
  Ford was a strong supporter of soybeans and saw the possibility for
  the use of soybeans in food, milk, ice cream, paint, plastics, and
  many other things before 1930. In Ford's fast-growing automobile
  industry, and since, the soybean played a large part in the
  manufacturing of commercial products.

      Title: HENRY VIII'S "SEVEN HERB WINE"
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 30 Litres
 
           Fruit juice
           Sugar
           Yeast
           Wormwood
           Tarragon
           Thyme
           Rosemary
           Hyssop
           Lovage
           Chervil
 
  The juices are extracted from the fruit (by cooking, pressing or
  equivalent). Use a 30 l (8 ga) container. For every litre (? ga) of
  (boiling) juice add 1 1/8 lb of sugar while stirring to dissolve the
  sugar. Stop approx. 10" from the top. Fill a bag (10"*16") made out
  of cheese cloth with the herbs and a stone (washed, of course) and
  lower it to the bottom of the container. Be sure to close it well!
  When the liquid is lukewarm add two toasted pieces of bread with 50 g
  (1 3/4 oz) of yeast (baking-) on each side. Cover the container and
  leave for 6-7 months (do check on it - I have no exact indication of
  time other then "in May we bottle..."). This makes a clear, dry,
  vermouth'ish wine. When made on summer apples it's more like Noilly
  Prat when made on plums it's sweeter and more fruity. If you don't
  like the fruit flavour you can add a "lid" of dried rowan berries on
  top (or use another bag) during the fermentation period. This removes
  the fruity taste and makes it more winelike. You can experiment with
  different herbs and spices. The wine(s) are perfect for cocktails
  (served in tall glasses with ice and lemon topped with some blue
  borage flowers on top), used in a bowle with fruit and soft drinks or
  just icecold as it is.

      Title: HERB & ONION BREAD (1 LOAF) (LACTO)
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Milk
  2 1/4 c  White or wheat flour
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/2 sm Onion, minced
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Dried dill weed
      1 pk Yeast
      1 ts Crushed, dried rosemary
    1/2 c  Warm water
 
  Scald the milk and dissolve in it the sugar and salt; cool to
  lukewarm. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Add
  the cooled milk, flour, minced onion, and herbs, and stir well with a
  large, wooden spoon.
  
  When the batter is smooth, cover the bowl with a towel and let the
  cough rise in a warm place until triple in bulk--about 45 minutes.
  Stir down and beat vigorously for a few minutes, then turn into a
  greased bread pan. Let it stand in a warm place about 10 minutes
  before putting it into a preheated, 350 F oven.  Bake about 1 hour.
  
  Notes:  I like to substitute oregano for the rosemary because I'm an
  oregano freak.  I usually add more herbs than it calls for. I
  sometimes add dried parsley, just so that there are more little green
  flecks in the dough.  (That way people know they are supposed to be
  there, and not just something weird that fell in the dough). Even
  though this recipe doesn't call for it, I knead the dough, because
  I'm happier with the texture that way.  This bread smells incredible
  when baking!
  
  Making bread by hand may seem daunting, but it only took me about 2
  or 3 batches to get used to it.  Once you learn how to do it, it's
  very rewarding, and doesn't really take that much time. It takes
  several hours, start to finish, but most of that time is not
  labor-intensive. I'm glad that people with bread machines are getting
  the taste of real bread, but it seems to me that they're missing out
  a lot of the experience. I hope you enjoy these!
  
  Basic Bread Info: Most recipes call for dissolving the yeast in warm
  water. Hot water out of the tap can be too warm for this. The water
  should be about 100-110 F (37-42C, 310-315K). If it is too hot, you
  will kill the yeast and your bread won't rise. Test it on your wrist
  like you would baby formula.
  
  Kneading the dough develops the gluten.  It is also when you add the
  last bits of flour.  Since flour varies so much in moisture content,
  the amount of flour you add will be a little different every time.
  Books always say to quit kneading when the dough is smooth and
  satiny. I usually stop kneading when it doesn't stick to my hands
  anymore. Then I let it rise. I put a little oil in the bottom of a
  bowl, put in the dough then turn the dough upside down.  The point of
  this is to grease the top of your dough so that it doesn't dry out.
  You could spray it with Pam instead, or make sure it rises in a
  fairly humid spot (put a bowl of warm water next to it while rising)
  .  Then put a dish towel over the bowl and put it in a warm
  draft-free place.  I use my oven, even though it isn't THAT warm. Do
  NOT turn the oven on. Let the dough rise until doubled (i.e., it's
  twice as big as it was before.) Then punch it down, by literally
  punching your fist into the dough. This is fun! The dough collapses.
  Now, some recipes call for letting the dough rise again. This gives
  the bread a lighter texture. Now you form your loaves and bake it.
  ALWAYS preheat the oven. The bread is done when it pulls away from
  the side of the pan. OR, you can take it out of the oven, flip it out
  of the pan, and knock on the bottom. If it sounds hollow, it's done.
  This is the true baker's way, but I can never tell if it's hollow or
  not. You can eat bread fresh out of the oven, but it's easier to cut
  if you wait until it cools. It tastes better if you don't wait,
  though!

  though this recipe doesn't call for it, I knead the dough, because
  I'm happier with the texture that way.  This bread smells incredible
  when baking!
  
  Making bread by hand may seem daunting, but it only took me about 2
  or 3 batches to get used to it.  Once you learn how to do it, it's
  very rewarding, and doesn't really take that much time. It takes
  several hours, start to finish, but most of that time is not
  labor-intensive. I'm glad that people with bread machines are getting
  the taste of real bread, but it seems to me that they're missing out
  a lot of the experience. I hope you enjoy these!
  
  Basic Bread Info: Most recipes call for dissolving the yeast in warm
  water. Hot water out of the tap can be too warm for this. The water
  should be about 100-110 F (37-42C, 310-315K). If it is too hot, you
  will kill the yeast and your bread won't rise. Test it on your wrist
  like you would baby formula.
  
  Kneading the dough develops the gluten.  It is also when you add the
  last bits of flour.  Since flour varies so much in moisture content,
  the amount of flour you add will be a little different every time.
  Books always say to quit kneading when the dough is smooth and
  satiny. I usually stop kneading when it doesn't stick to my hands
  anymore. Then I let it rise. I put a little oil in the bottom of a
  bowl, put in the dough then turn the dough upside down.  The point of
  this is to grease the top of your dough so that it doesn't dry out.
  You could spray it with Pam instead, or make sure it rises in a
  fairly humid spot (put a bowl of warm water next to it while rising)
  . Then put a dish towel over the bowl and put it in a warm draft-free
  place. I use my oven, even though it isn't THAT warm. Do NOT turn the
  oven on. Let the dough rise until doubled (i.e., it's twice as big as
  it was before.) Then punch it down, by literally punching your fist
  into the dough. This is fun! The dough collapses. Now, some recipes
  call for letting the dough rise again. This gives the bread a lighter
  texture. Now you form your loaves and bake it. ALWAYS preheat the
  oven. The bread is done when it pulls away from the side of the pan.
  OR, you can take it out of the oven, flip it out of the pan, and
  knock on the bottom. If it sounds hollow, it's done. This is the true
  baker's way, but I can never tell if it's hollow or not. You can eat
  bread fresh out of the oven, but it's easier to cut if you wait until
  it cools. It tastes better if you don't wait, though!

      Title: HERB CREPES WITH GOAT'S CHEESE STUFFING
 Categories: Eggs, Cheese, Scottish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lg Eggs
    120 g  Plain (all-purpose) flour
      1 pn Salt
           Pepper; freshly ground
      3 dl Milk
      2 tb Cold water
           Few chives; snipped
      1 sm Handful of parsley
           Some fresh tarragon leaves
      2    Sprigs of fresh dillweed
           -Filling
    450 g  Goat's cheese; rind removed
      2    Egg whites
 
  (Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350
  oF; 200 oC = 400 oF; 230 oC = 450 oF; 250 oC = 475 oF; 2.5 cm = 1
  inch)
  
  (Two crepes per person for a first course, serve with the tomato
  sauce)
  
  Break the eggs into a liquidizer or food processor and add the flour,
  salt and pepper to taste. Whiz, gradually adding the milk and water.
  Add the snipped chives, which unless snipped just wrap themselves
  around the blades, and the other herbs and whiz until the herbs are
  fine. Pour the crepe batter into a jug and leave to stand for half an
  hour.
  
  To cook the crepes, melt a small amount of butter, about 1 1/2 ts, in
  a crepe or omelette pan, and swirl it over the surface of the pan.
  Pour in just enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan, swirling
  the batter around so that the crepe will be as thin as possible. Over
  a moderate heat, cook for about 30 seconds, then turn the crepe over
  using a small palette knife or spatula and your fingers.
  
  As they are cooked, stack the crepes with a piece of greaseproof (wax)
  paper between each, to prevent them sticking together.
  
  For the filling, put the cheese into a food processor with the egg
  whites and whiz until smooth.
  
  Put a generous teaspoonful of filling in the middle of each crepe and
  fold into a fat rectangle. Put the stuffed crepes into an oiled or
  buttered heatproof dish and brush them with melted butter. Bake in a
  preheated moderate oven 180 oC for 20 minutes.

           For the socca nicoise:
      1 c  Ground chick pea flour
  2 1/2 c  Whole milk
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Egg
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
           For the tapenade:
      1 c  Pitted late harvest olives
      1    Fillet anchovy
      2 tb Basil
      1 ts Sherry vinegar
    1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil --
           (1/2 to 3/4)
           Milled pepper to taste
           For the lamb:
      2    Eighteen ounce racks of
           Lamb
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
 
  Preparation of the herb crust: Chop all picked herbs and blend in a
  food processor with other ingredients until it is smooth and
  homogenous. Reserve in refrigerator or freezer.
  
  Preparation of the pepper ragout: Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
  Prelight a mesquite grill and let embers cool. Place all the peppers,
  chiles, and onion on the grill and char well. Place the garlic cloves
  in a pouch of aluminum foil and roast over coals until lightly golden
  brown. Once peppers are charred, place them in a bowl, cover with
  plastic wrap and allow to steam for ten minutes. Remove the skins
  from the chiles, pepper and onion and cut into large chunks, after
  removing any seeds or white membranes. Cut the garlic into large
  chunks and mix with peppers and onions.
  
  In a heavy sauce pot, add the olive oil and heat over a medium fire
  and sweat the pepper mixture. Add the lavender, salt, pepper and
  honey and bake, uncovered in oven until the liquid from the peppers
  has reduced. Remove and cool to room temperature, adjust seasonings
  and add whole leaves of basil.
  
  Preparation of the socca nicoise: Place flour in a mixing bowl and
  add the milk in a steady stream until smooth. Add olive oil, egg,
  salt and pepper. Strain and let rest for two hours in refrigerator.
  Consistency should be similar to crepe batter. Preparation of the
  tapenade: Puree all ingredients in a food processor, not too smooth
  but should remain chunky. Let sit at room temperature.
  
  Presentation: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Heat a heavy saute pan and
  add a drizzle of olive oil over high heat. Get oil to smoking point.
  Season the racks of lamb and sear well on all sides, place in oven
  and cook for fifteen minutes until rare. Cut a piece of the herb
  butter and place on top of the rack of lamb. Put back in oven and
  cook another five to seven minutes until medium rare and crust is
  golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to rest for five minutes.
  Cut rack in half, between the chops and reserve warm. In a small
  nonstick pan, heat the olive oil over medium to high heat and add the
  chick pea batter. Color well on both sides. Place on a warm plate and
  make as many as you would like. Place a small pile of the roasted
  pepper ragout in the center, place the rack of lamb on top and
  drizzle around with tapenade. Garnish with fried Italian parsley.
  Serve immediately.

      1 tb Fresh savory, minced
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  To prepare Dried Apricot-Walnut Stuffing: Slice and cut bread into
  1/2-inch cubes and place in shallow roasting pan. Bake about 20
  minutes at 350 degrees until slightly dry, stirring twice. Toast
  walnuts at same time in shallow pan for 10 minutes, stirring once.

  tender but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add wine, apricots, thyme,
  sage, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer about 5 minutes. Remove from
  heat.
  
  Combine bread cubes, walnuts, wine-shallot mixture, prosciutto,
  parsley and egg in very large bowl. Add chicken broth until desired
  moistness is attained.
  
  To prepare capon: Just before roasting, stuff capon. Spoon stuffing
  loosely into neck cavity, then pull neck skin back and fasten with
  small skewer. Lightly spoon stuffing into body cavity. (Bake
  remaining stuffing in buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole at 325 degrees
  during last 40 to 45 minutes of capon's roasting time.) Tie
  drumsticks securely to tail. Twist wing tips under the back.

  walnut oil with butter in small pan and melt over low heat. Stir in
  sage, thyme, savory and salt, and cook until herbs wilt slightly.
  Brush some mixture over capon. If using meat thermometer, insert it
  into one of inside thigh muscles.
  
  Cover capon loosely with foil. Roast at 325 degrees 3 to 3 1/2 hours.
  After 2 hours, cut string between drumsticks so thighs cook evenly.
  Uncover last 45 minutes, basting occasionally with remaining herb
  butter. Continue roasting capon until meat ther- mometer registers
  about 180 degrees.
  
  Remove bird from oven and cover with foil. Let bird stand 10 to 15
  minutes before carving.

      Title: HERB STICKS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 70 Servings
 
      3 c  All-purpose flour
      4 ts Dried herbs, crushed with
           The fingers or a rolling
           Pin, OR
      4 tb Finely chopped, fresh herbs
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 c  Water
      1    Egg white, lightly beaten
           And diluted with 1 to 2 Tb
           Milk for the tops
 
  "The herb flavors become intense in these simple crackers. Try any of
  your favorite herbs and spices, alone or in combinations. Dill works
  well, as does a mix of four parts basil to one part oregano. These
  crackers go well with dips and are expecially good crumbled into
  soups and salads.
  
  325~F.      15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  Combine the flour, herbs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl or in the
  food processor. Add the oil and blend until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal. Slowly blend in enough of the water to form a dough that
  will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out very thin,
      1/8    inch maximum.
  
  With a sharp knife, cut the dough into rectangles 1 inch by 5 inches
  and place them on an ungreased baking sheet.
  
  Prick each cracker in 3 places with a fork, pressing all the way
  through the dough. Brush the tops with the egg mixture. Bake for 10
  minutes. Turn the crackers over, brush them with the egg mixture, and
  continue baking for another 5 to 10 mintues. Cool on a rack. These
  crackers will crispen as they cool. If some of them are still not
  crisp after cooling, put them back in the oven for a few minutes and
  let them cool again. Yield: 60-70.

      Title: HERB VINEGAR-BEV
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Fresh herbs  OR USE
    1/3 c  Dried herbs
      1 qt Vinegar
 
  Place herbs in a large jar or bottle and pour vinegar over them. Set
  the jar or bottle in a sunny window for two weeks, turning regularly.
  The heat of the sun will extract flavor fromthe herbs. If you are
  going to used the herbed vinegar immediately after the sun process
  there is no need to filter it.  If you are planning to keep it for
  several months, strain the herbs and pour the vinegar through a
  coffee filter and into a clean bottle. Add one or two fresh springs
  of the herb or herbs used in the vinegar. An even quicker way is to
  heat the vinegar to boiling point, remove from heat, and pour over
  herbs.  Let steep (like tea) until cool. Strain through a coffee
  filter to remove the herbs, and bottle with one or two fresh sprigs
  as above.  Several sources recommend White Wine Vinegar or Rice Wine
  Vinegar as a base.  Regarless of the chioce, quality is of the
  essence. SOME FLAVORED VINEGARS AND POSSIBLE USES Basil - tomatoes,
  pasta salads, vegetable salads. Chives & Chive blossoms - for a hint
  of onion Dill - fish, potato, vegetable salads Fennel - fish &
  whatever you want anise flavor Mine - Lamb & for fruit salads &
  desserts Nasturtium flowers & leaves - a peppery taste Tarragon -
  salads & chicken dishes Drying herbs works very well for me,
  especially when I get more than I can use fresh. To dry them I pick
  out any damaged leaves or blossoms, check for bugs, always know my
  sources - to protect against spray or systemic insecticide and tie
  them loosely in bunches with string, and hang them upside down in a
  well-ventilated, sunny spot I have in the opening between my kitchen
  and dining area. I've also had really good luck keeping fresh herbs,
  laid out on a strong paper towel, rolled gently like a jelly roll,
  and place inside a ziplock bag, then placed in the crisper of the
  refrigerator. These last weeks for me.

      x  Sprigs of fresh herbs; with
         - their flowers, if
         - available (when bottling)
  
  "My favorite herb vinegar is rosemary made with a rich red wine
  vinegar. It is the only one I use regularly, preferring to add other
  herbs fresh to specific dishes.  You should experiment until you find
  your favorite combinations."
  
  Crush the fresh herbs, place them in a glass jar or crock, and cover
  with the vinegar.  Let the mixture steep in a cool pantry for up to 1
  month, tasting to determine when your vinegar is sufficiently
  flavored. Strain through cheesecloth or a coffee filter.  Bottle, add
  a fresh sprig of the herb, and close with a cork.  Store in a cool,
  dark cupboard.
  
  Suggested Combinations:
  
  Rosemary with red wine vinegar Chives with white wine vinegar Sage
  with red or white wine vinegar Oregano with red or white wine vinegar
  Savory with white wine vinegar Majoram with red wine vinegar Tarragon
  with champagne vinegar Thyme with champagne vinegar

      Title: HERB-OATMEAL BREAD (CLAY-POT)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      2 pk Active dry yeast
      3 tb Honey
  1 1/2 tb Salt
      2 c  Water
    3/4 c  Oatmeal; not instant
      2 tb Sour cream
    3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 ts Celery seeds
      1 ts Poppy seeds
      1 tb Sesame seeds
      1 tb Fresh sage; chopped
      1 tb Fresh basil; chopped
    1/2 ts Dill; dried
      1    Egg; beaten
      2 tb Butter; melted
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
      4 c  All-purpose flour
 
  Combine the yeast, honey and salt with 1 cup lukewarm (not hot) water
  and set aside. (Remember: if the water is too hot it will kill the
  growing yeast.)
  
  Heat 1 cup water to boiling, and add the oatmeal and sour cream.
  Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and cool
  to lukewarm. Combine the whole-wheat flour, seeds, and herbs in a
  large mixing bowl. Add the oatmeal and yeast mixtures and beat until
  well blended. Add beaten egg and melted butter and beat several times
  again. Add the pine nuts, then add 3 cups of the all-purpose flour,
  one cup at a time, beating between each addition until a fairly stiff
  dough is developed.
  
  Spread the remaining all-purpose flour on a board and knead the dough
  into it thoroughly, about a dozen times, then put the dough in a
  large, well-greased bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Set to rise in
  a warm place until double its original bulk (about 1 hour).
  
  Just before the end of the rising time, presoak 2 clay pots, top and
  bottom, in hot water for 15 minutes. (We use 2 pots in order to bake
  each loaf separately.)
  
  Place the risen dough on a floured board, divide, and shape into 2
  loaves. Before putting the loaves in the presoaked pots, put a small
  piece of aluminum foil, just large enough to cover the bottom of the
  loaf, on the bottom of each pot. (This keeps the bread from sticking
  to the pot.) Place the dough inside the pots, cover, and allow to
  rise until almost doubled in bulk (about 45 minutes). (I wrapped the
  pot in a wet towel to keep it from drying out too soon.)
  
  Cover the pots and put them in a cold oven.
  
  Set the oven temperature at 480 degrees. Bake for 40 minutes. If
  necessary, remove lid for the last 5 minutes of baking to get a
  golden brown crust.

  NOTE: This is the best bread I've made in a long time. High loaf,
  light, and with a very crisp crust and moist inside. Pine nuts don't
  add much to it and could be left out. Had a problem with it sticking
  to the pot (my clay pot has a semi-glazed bottom which I greased very
  lightly with shortening, and it still stuck in spots).

    1/8 ts Dried red pepper
    1/8 ts Dried basil; -OR-
    1/2 ts -Fresh basil
  1 1/2 ts Chopped fresh parsley
           Salt; to taste

MMMMM-----------------MUSHROOM-RED PEPPER SAUCE----------------------
      1    Red bell pepper; minced
    1/8 c  Vegetable broth or water
           -OR- more as needed
      4 lg Mushrooms; minced
    1/4 c  Onion; minced
           Salt; to taste
    1/8 ts Celery seed

           -- (pastry flour works best)
 
  These plant-based sausages taste great, contain no added fat except
  the vegetable oil they're fried in, and are easy to make. These
  ingredients yield fairly mild sausages; after you've tried them,
  adjust the seasonings to please your palate.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl, mix
  thoroughly, and shape into 1- to 2-inch sausages. Saute in a small
  amount of vegetable oil until crisp, or place in a baking pan and
  broil, turning when edges are slightly crisp. Serve with Mushroom-Red
  Pepper Sauce (below).
  
  MUSHROOM-RED PEPPER SAUCE:  Cook red pepper in vegetable broth for 5
  to 7 minutes until tender.  Add mushrooms, onion, salt, celery seed,
  oregano, and black pepper. Cook 5 minutes longer or until onion is
  transparent. Quickly whisk in enough flour to just thicken the sauce,
  about 2 tablespoons at a time. Immediately remove from burner. Do not
  overcook, or flour will cake.  If needed, add more vegetable broth or
  water. Serve over sausages, whole grains, or vegetables.

      1    Info below
 
                   - General and Historical Information-
  
  "The burning of sweet gums, resins, woods, and plants has taken
  hundreds of beautiful, diverse cultural forms, many of which persist
  today. Ancient Egyptians burned offerings to the sun god, Ra, on his
  daily trek across the heavens.  Frequent references to the use of
  incense in the Old Testament suggest that the Jews have used it since
  very early times. Modern Hindus burn camphor and incense before the
  image of Krishna. The Greeks burned sweet incenses to make sacrifice
  and prayer more acceptable to the gods. Little use of incense is
  evident in Islamic traditions, and incense was unknown in early
  Buddhism, opposed as it was to external dogma. However, public and
  private use of incense has now become widespread among Tibetan,
  Japanese, and Chinese Buddhists.  By the fourteenth century, it had
  become part of most of the established Christian rituals, and is
  still used for such ceremonies as high mass, processions, and
  funerals. Modern pagan and neopagan practices also involve highly
  developed ritual uses of incense. In Native American religion, sage,
  sweet grass, yerba santa, uva-ursi, cedar, and tobacco are burned
  ceremonially for purifying oneself and one's environment, for sending
  up prayers to the Great Spirit, and for connecting with one's spirit
  helpers - the unseen forces that assist humans.
  
  "Besides its place in ceremony and religion, incense is often used
  simply to evoke a mood or create an atmosphere...
  
  "Incense makes use of many botanical products which cannot be
  liquefied or distilled into a perfume.  Tree barks and saps, gums,
  resins, roots, flowers, fragrant leaves, and needles can be combined
  in myriad ways to create a rising, mood-enhancing bouquet of fragrant
  smoke. The botanical ingredients may be purchased, grown, or gathered
  from the wild."
  
  "Incense can take many forms, from simple, loose ingredients to be
  thrown on glowing coals to ornately shaped cones, cylinders, sticks,
  or coils. All are fun to make and enjoyable to use. All except loose
  incense consists of four basic ingredients: an aromatic substance or
  mixture, a burnable base, a bonding agent, and a liquid to change the
  bonding agent into a glue. Coloring agents can be added as well."

      Title: HERBAL INCENSE INFORMATION II/III
 Categories: Seasonings, Info
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
                       - Basic Incense Ingredients -
  
  "AROMATIC:  Any herb, spice, or botanical powder that gives off a
  pleasingly scented smoke when burning. These include many kinds of
  wood (such as sandalwood and juniper) and bark (such as cinnamon) as
  well as some leaves.  The smoke from burning herbs smells different
  from the fresh or dried herb itself.  To test the fragrance of herb
  smoke, drop a small amount of the dried herb on a hot piece of
  charcoal. I have never heard of an herb whose smoke was toxic, though
  certain mushrooms can produce narcotic fumes. Essential oils also can
  be substituted for the aromatic plant material; again, test on hot
  charcoal.
  
  "BASE:  A substance that burns readily with either a pleasant aroma
  or no aroma at all.  The base aids in the burning of the aromatic and
  often enhances or tempers the scent. The most popular bases are
  powders derived from woody plants: sandalwood, cassia, vetiver,
  willow, evergreen needles, and charcoal.  You can make the wood
  powders yourself by processing sawdust in your blender for two
  minutes on high speed. Talc or clay is sometimes added to slow the
  rate of burning, but I don't recommend talc because it can cause
  respiratory irritation. Potassium nitrate (saltpeter, available at
  drugstores) may be added to a base to ignite it more quickly and
  evenly.
  
  "BONDING AGENT:  A resin or gum that holds the aromatic and base
  together. Bonding agents that burn well without giving off toxic
  smoke and are readily available include agar, karaya, gum arabic, and
  tragacanth. Of these, tragacanth is the binder most often
  recommended...it's the easiest to work with and gives the best
  results for shaped incense."
  
  "LIQUID:  Water is easiest and cheapest, although creative incense
  makers may not be satisfied when there are much more interesting
  liquids to use: wine, brandy, herb waters, olive oil, and tinctures,
  to mention just a few. I haven't noticed a significant difference in
  either the odor or the burnability of the incense.
  
  "COLORING AGENTS:  The easiest way to color incense is with food
  coloring, but plants can also supply natural colors: for example, red
  sandalwood for red, willow for brown, safflower for yellow, and
  charcoal for black."

      Title: HERBAL INCENSE INFORMATION III/III
 Categories: Seasonings, Info
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
                     - Tools, Methods, and Recipes -
  
  "The recipes that follow are simply examples of what's possible. You
  can apply the basic methods and proportions to the creation of your
  own [scents]. You'll want to keep a journal of your formulations,
  lest the perfect blend be created only once!
  
  "You'll need a blender, a wooden spoon, a bowl or two, and a set of
  measuring spoons and cups.  Be aware that porous utensils may take up
  some scents from your aromatic ingredients. Brown paper will protect
  your work surfaces, and a wooden board can serve as a drying surface.
  
  "The volume of aromatic substances should be about twice that of the
  base, and all dry ingredients should be powdered. Use about three
  parts liquid to five parts dry mixture. Besides changing the bonding
  agent from a dry powder into a glue, the liquid also serves to
  dissolve the potassium nitrate."
  
  "For each recipe except the loose incense, mix together liquid and
  potassium nitrate and add enough tragacanth to make a thick paste
  (start with 1 teaspoon and add more as needed). Then stir in the
  blended dry ingredients.  If the dough is too soft, add more
  tragacanth powder; if too dry, add more liquid. The consistency
  should be like that of soft putty or moist dough - neither too runny
  nor too dry to be easily shaped.
  
  "You may shape prepared incense dough into all manner of cones,
  cylinders, or coils or roll it onto sticks. Bamboo skewers split
  lengthwise with a razor blade make suitable sticks. After forming
  cones, cylinders, and coils, place them on a wooden board and set
  them aside to dry in a sunny window, a warm attic, or even a closed
  vehicle on a hot day. Avoid humidity, which will make your incense
  mildew. When drying stick incense, poke the lower ends of the sticks
  into a piece of clay or styrofoam.
  
  "When the incense is thoroughly dry, store it in airtight containers.
  Dark, dry conditions will help to preserve color and scent."
  
  "Loose incense consists of dry ingredients which are simply mixed
  together and sprinkled over smoldering charcoal. Store as you would
  other kinds of incense.
  
  "...charcoal is referred to as a base ingredient, a coloring agent,
  and the smoldering heat source for loose incense. Most books
  recommend willow charcoal (available from incense suppliers), but any
  charcoal can be used. The briquettes that are made for use in
  barbecue grills are suitable unless they have been impregnated with
  lighter fluid or other chemicals to enhance burning.
  
                           - Incense Alert -
  
  "Most people can make and use incense with no untoward effects, but
  some, especially those with hay fever, asthma, or certain skin
  problems, may have adverse reactions to the ingredients or the smoke.
  And be aware of the fire hazard when using incense: smoldering
  incense improperly contained can ignite your furniture, drapes, or
  other flammable things in the home. It's best to keep incense and
  fire out of the reach of children."
  
                  - Smudge Sticks and Sweet-Grass Braids -
  
  "Simple and exquisite incense from the Native American tradition can
  be enjoyed by growing and/or gathering special herbs from the wild.
  Sprigs of sage (Salvia apiana or S. officinalis) and cedar (Juniperus
  virginiana) can be bound together with cotton string into a
  cigar-shaped smudge stick, which is then burned a bit at a time.
  
  "Clumps of sweet grass (Hierochloe odorata) may be pulled up by the
  roots and hung, roots up, to dry. The blades are then braided and
  burned a little at a time..."

      1 tb Minced Fresh Chervil; OR
      1 ts Dried Chervil; Crushed
      1 tb Minced Shallots Or Scallions
      2 tb Dry White Wine
      2 tb White Wine Vinegar
 
  Buy a prime fillet, if possible, and fold under and tie the tail to
  form a roast of uniform thickness. Melt the butter in a small
  saucepan. Stir in the tarragon, chervil, and shallots or scallions.
  Cook over very low heat for a minute or two.  Slowly stir in the wine
  and vinegar and heat slowly. Place the meat on a tray and brush with
  the herbed butter. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour, brushing
  with the sauce 2 or 3 times more. Remove the meat from the tray and
  pour any sauce remaining on the tray into the saucepan with the
  remaining sauce. Brown the fillet over the coals on all sides for
  about 10 minutes, watching carefully to prevent any fire flareups.
  Move the meat to the edge of the grill or cover the grill and adjust
  the dampers to maintain slow steady heat. Grill 15 to 20 minutes
  longer or until the fillet is done as desired. Heat the remaining
  sauce at the edge of the grill and serve with the sliced fillet.

      Title: HERBED BISCUIT EGG BAKE
 Categories: Eggs, Herb/spice
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Herbed biscuit crust:
      2 c  Flour
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 ts Dried crushed rosemary
      1 tb Garlic powder
      1 ts Lemon pepper
      6    To 7 tablespoons shortening
    2/3    -3/4 cup milk
           FILLING:
      7    Eggs
      1    Onion, chopped
      2 c  Lightly steamed broccoli
           Flowerets
      1 c  Grated cheddar cheese
      1 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Dried tarragon
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
    1/2 ts Lemon pepper
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
 
  1. To make biscuit crust: Into bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and
  salt. Add the garlic powder, lemon pepper, thyme, and rosemary. With
  pastry blender or 2 knives, used scissor-fashion, cut in shortening
  until mixture is like coarse corn meal.  Make well in center; pour in
  1/2 cup milk. With fork, mix lightly and quickly. Add enough more
  milk to form dough, just moist enough to leave sides of bowl and
  cling to fork as ball. Knead a few times, working gently, until a
  dough is formed.
  
  2. Press the biscuit dough into an 8" x 8" inch pan, lining bottom and
  sides.  Depending upon how thick you want the crust, there may be a
  little left over -- it can be used for biscuits baked on the side or
  as a crust for a smaller individual dish.
  
  3. Lightly cook the chopped onions -- either steam, saute, or cook in
  the microwave for a few minutes. Spread the onion over the dough in
  the pan.
  
  4. In a bowl, mix the eggs, tarragon, thyme, garlic powder, lemon
  pepper, and salt if desired.  Pour into crust.
  
  5. Add the broccoli flowerets to the egg mixture in the crust.
  Sprinkle the cup of grated cheddar cheese over the top. Bake in a 400
  degree oven for 35-40 minutes.
  
  Note: You can vary the ingredients by using different vegetables,
  cheeses, or meats in the filling.  You can also substitute your
  favourite herbs in the crust.

      Title: HERBED CORN ON THE COB
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 ea Corn ears, unhusked
    1/4 c  Butter, softened to room tem
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Salt

  ear of corn, then close the husk around the corn. 5. Wrap each ear of
  corn tightly in foil and bake for
       30    minutes or until tender. Time-Savers: MICROWAVE TIP: To
  cook the corn in the microwave, after spreading the butter on in step
  5, sprinkle a few drops of water over the kernels, then tightly wrap
  in plastic wrap. Cook (on paper towels in case any butter leaks out)
  for 12 to 15 minutes on HIGH, rearranging the corn about half way
  through the cooking. Let stand 5 minutes and serve. DO-AHEAD: The
  herbed butter for the corn can be made well ahead of time and stored
  in the refrigerator or freezer; In fact, you can double or triple the
  quantities and keep it on hand, frozen, for anytime you have corn on
  the cob.

     12 oz Bread cubes (herbed)
      1 lg Yellow onion,
           -chopped fine
      3    Celery stalks,
           -chopped fine
      3 c  Rice, cooked (cooled

           Salt
           Black pepper
           Rubbed sage
           Thyme
 
  MAKE CORNBREAD:  The night before, make the cornbread. Preheat oven
  to 425 degrees F.
  
  Thinly coat the bottom of a standard Pyrex pie plate, or 9-inch square
  baking pan, with vegetable oil. Put pan in oven while it is
  preheating and you are mixing the cornbread batter.
  
  In a mixing bowl, blend together the cornmeal, flour, salt and baking
  powder. Stir in the egg and about 3 T vegetable oil. Add milk and mix
  thoroughly by hand. The consistency should be a thick, but not
  "doughy," liquid.  It may be necessary to add a little more milk.
  Pour into preheated pan and bake for 30 minutes or until slightly
  brown on top.
  
  Let cool in pan for 30 minutes.  Remove from pan and break up into
  very large chunks in a large mixing bowl. Let stand overnight,
  uncovered. This will ensure that it is dry and stale.
  
  MAKE TURKEY BROTH:  The night before, make the turkey broth. Bring
  about 12 C of water to a boil in a large pot. Thoroughly rinse turkey
  neck, giblets and gizzard. Add turkey parts, onion, celery leaves and
  celery stalk to water, cover and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer
  on very low heat for 2 hours. Strain the broth, cover, cool quickly
  and refrigerate.

      Title: HERBED CORNBREAD DRESSING~ PART 2 OF 2
 Categories: Entrees, Southwest, Holiday, Herbs
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           See Part 1
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  MAKE DRESSING:  30 minutes before you are ready to stuff the turkey,
  make the dressing.
  
  Crumble the stale cornbread in the very largest bowl you can find.
  Add the herbed bread cubes and mix thoroughly by hand. Add the rice
  and mix thoroughly by hand.
  
  Briefly saute the onions and celery in butter just enough to make the
  vegetables translucent.  Saute the mushrooms in butter (or margarine)
  until all the resulting liquid has evaporated. Add the sauteed
  onions, celery and mushrooms, and mix thoroughly. Add the pecans and
  mix thoroughly. Season with salt, pepper, sage and thyme to taste.
  
  Bring the turkey broth to the boil and boil for a minute or two to
  make sure it is sterile. If you are going to stuff the turkey, add
  just enough turkey broth to barely moisten the dressing. Taste for
  seasoning and adjust if necessary.
  
  Very loosely stuff the abdominal cavity and breast cavity with
  dressing. Do not pack it in tightly.  It needs room to expand. You
  are going to be cooking some more dressing in a baking pan beside the
  turkey, so there will be plenty to go around.
  
  Secure neck cavity opening with one or more poultry skewers. The
  abdominal cavity may be left open or (if your butcher cleaned the
  turkey properly and left a flap of skin) secured with poultry skewers.
  
  Add enough boiling broth to the remaining dressing to moisten it
  uniformly. Do not over-moisten.  The baked dressing should be barely
  moist, not gummy-wet.  14 Spoon dressing into uncoated baking pans.
  Cover with foil/plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to bake.
  
  One half hour before serving dinner, bake dressing, uncovered, at 425
  degrees F. for 30 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Southwestern style herbed cornbread turkey stuffing ~- This is the
  traditional McGarvey family dressing for Thanksgiving and Christmas
  dinner. It originated with my maternal grandmother in southern
  Virginia and evolved through her moves to Texas, Oklahoma and
  California and further evolved through my military family's moves all
  over the world. The recipe includes making 1 batch of cornbread and 1
  batch of turkey broth. Directions are given for both stuffing the
  bird and baking the dressing separately.
  
  *  This recipe makes enough dressing to stuff a 15-pound turkey and 2
  9-inch-square baking pans.
  
  *  Never stuff the turkey until you are ready to roast it. Cooking
  lore is rife with horror stories of food poisoning resulting from
  turkeys stuffed too early and let sit while wonderful organisms
  develop in the stuffing. Make sure you bring the turkey broth to a
  boil before you use it, just to make sure that nothing is growing in
  it. The stuffing inside a turkey does not reach a high enough
  temperature to kill bacteria while the turkey is roasting, so you
  must be extremely careful with what you put there.
  
  *  I like to use Pepperidge Farm brand herbed bread cubes.
  
  *  I use a huge ceramic bowl (large enough for "rising" a 4-loaf
  recipe of bread dough) in which  to mix the dressing. If you don't
  have one handy, you can use your kitchen sink. Clean and rinse the
  sink thoroughly, then put in the stopper and use as a mixing bowl. If
  you are going to stuff the turkey, be sure that you don't overmoisten
  the dressing. The stuffing will absorb a lot of moisture from the
  bird, and who wants a turkey with stuffing soup? Also, be sure to not
  over-stuff the turkey: the stuffing will expand during the roasting
  and it needs room to expand.
  
  *  About 12 C of turkey broth is at least double the amount of liquid
  necessary to moisten the dressing. If you use all of it, you will not
  have a relatively light, dry dressing. The extra broth should be used
  in making turkey gravy or can be the base stock for making turkey
  soup with the carcass. If you're not up to making turkey broth, you
  can substitute chicken broth, but this is a great way to use the neck
  and gizzard.
  
  *  No quantities of the herbs are given because you can make this as
  spicy or as mild as you like. We like ours heavy on the sage and
  thyme.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  several hours, spread over 2 days.
  : Precision:  measure the cornbread ingredients.

      Title: HERBED FOCACCIA
 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 ts Sugar
      1 c  Warm water (105-115F)
  2 1/3 c  Bread flour
    1/3 c  Cornmeal
  1 1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Light-tasting olive oil
      2 lg Garlic cloves; minced
      1 ts Dried rosemary
      1 ts Dried basil
      1 ts Dried oregano
           Kosher salt
      1 tb Fresh chives, snipped
      1 tb Fresh parsley, minced
      1 tb Red pepper flakes
 
  A small amount of cornmeal gives this focaccia--a flat bread--a
  perfect texture for improvised open sandwiches. You might start with
  thinly sliced salami and cheese. PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Fifteen
  minutes before baking focaccia, put rack in center of oven. If you
  have 2 ovens, preheat both; otherwise bake focaccias in sequence, one
  after the other. Generously oil 2 large baking sheets, preferably
  black steel. Stir yeast and sugar into warm water. Let stand until
  foamy, about 5 minutes. Mix flour, cornmeal and salt in food
  processor fitted with metal blade (can also be kneaded with mixer
  dough hook or by hand). Turn on processor. Slowly pour yeast mixture
  through feed tube. Also pour 2 tablespoons oil through. Process until
  dough cleans inside of work bowl but is still moist. If it sticks,
  add a little flour; if it's dry, add a little water. Once dough is
  moist but not so wet that it sticks to sides of bowl, process until
  uniformly kneaded, elastic and supple, about 40 seconds. Transfer
  dough to large plastic food bag, squeeze out air and seal at top,
  allowing room for dough to expand. Let dough rise in warm spot until
  doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; use immediately or refrigerate
  overnight. Combine remaining 6 tablespoons oil, garlic and dried
  herbs. Gently heat until warm (not hot) on stove top or microwave
  oven. Divide dough in half. Let rest 5 minutes. On floured board,
  roll each piece into about a 12-inch round. Transfer to prepared
  baking sheets. Prick surface with fork. Brush with oil mixture,
  including edges. Sprinkle with Kosher salt. Bake, one at a time,
  until very lightly browned around edges only, about 8-10 minutes. Do
  not overbake. Check after 2 minutes in oven; prick any air pockets
  with fork. Brush with any remaining oil, including edges. Sprinkle
  with fresh herbs and pepper flakes. Can be baked in advance and
  frozen. To do so, cool completely, freeze and then wrap airtight. Let
  thaw in wrapping. To reheat, place in cold oven and set at 300F. Bake
  until hot, about 5-7 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve hot. Yield: 2
  12-inch rounds.

      Title: HERBED GREY MULLET
 Categories: Barry, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Grey Mullet, cleaned and
           -trimmed
        bn Fresh Parsley (good size)
           Sprig of celery leaves
      2    Sprigs fresh thyme
      2    Bay leaves
      2    Lemons, sliced
      1 tb Butter
           Salt and pepper
 
  Preheat the oven to gas mark 5, 375F, 190C. Wash the herbs and remove
  the stalks from the parsley. Chop the parsley leaves coarsely and put
  them on one side. Chop the parsley stalks, celery leaves and thyme
  and mix with the bay leaves. Stuff the cavity of the fish with this
  mixture. Oil a large sheet of kitchen foil and put a line of lemon
  slices into the cavity and arrange the rest of the lemon long the top
  of the fish. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle generously with
  the parsley leaves and wrap the fish loosely in the foil, but make
  sure the edges of the foil are tightly sealed. Put it in the oven and
  bake for 45 minutes.
  
  To serve, unwrap the foil carefully - there will be a wonderfully
  herby, lemony, cloud of steam - and remove as much of the liquid that
  has formed around the fish as possible. You can serve that as a sauce
  on its own or boil it up briefly with either a knob of butter or a
  couple of tablespoons of double cream to make it rich and special.
  
  Lay the fish on a serving dish and serve with new potatoes.

      Title: HERBED QUINOA
 Categories: Seasonings, Grains, Side dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Quinoa; thoroughly rinsed
      2 c  ;Water
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 md Garlic clove; peel and mince
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Fresh basil, packed* or
    1/4 c  Fresh tarragon plus
      2 tb Fresh thyme
 
  *If the listed herbs are unavailable, substitute an equal amount of
  parsley, or 1 ts. dried thyme, basil or oregano.
  
  Put quinoa, water and salt in a medium-size saucepan, cover, and
  bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover
  partially so the steam can escape, and cook at a slow boil until
  grains have doubled in size, become translucent, and are cracked open
  so that the spiral germ of the grain is visible, about 12 minutes. If
  necessary, continue cooking, uncovered, until all the liquid has been
  absorbed or has evaporated, which may take 1 more minute.
  
  While quinoa is cooking, combine olive oil, garlic and a generous
  amount of pepper in a warmed medium-size bowl. Just before the quinoa
  is cooked, coarsely but neatly chop basil leaves and mix them into
  the olive oil mixture.  When quinoa is ready, add it to the olive
  oil, tossing until it is thoroughly combined. Check seasonings and
  serve immediately.
  
  Nice accompaniment to steamed fish or to roasted meats or poultry. Or
  serve as a main course along with a variety of vegetables and salads.

        1 ts Garlic Salt
        1 ts Basil -- Dried
      1/2 ts Marjoram -- Dried
      1/2 ts Thyme -- Dried
      1/4 ts Pepper
        4 lb to 6 Lb Roast Beef-See Note
        3 Lb Kosher Salt -- See Note
    1 1/4 c  Water
  
  Combine oil, onion, garlic salt, basil, marjoram, thyme and pepper in
  heavy plastic bag.  Mix well.
   Add roast; coat well with marinade. Marinate in refrigerator 2 hours
  or overnight.
  
  Line roasting pan with aluminum foil.  Combine coarse kosher salt and
  water to form a thick paste.  Pat 1 cup paste into a 1/2-inch thick
  rectangle in pan. Pat roast dry with paper towels. Insert meat
  thermometer. Place roast on salt layer.  Pack remaining salt paste
  around meat to seal well.
  
  Place roast in a 425-degree oven and roast 16 - 18 minutes per pound
  for rare (140 degrees), 20 - 22 minutes per pound for medium (160
  degrees), or 25 - 30 minutes per pound for well done (170 degrees).
  
  Remove roast when thermometer registers 5 degrees below desired
  doneness. Let roast stand 5 - 10 minutes in salt crust before carving.
  
  If using an instant read thermometer (kind that isn't inserted before
  roasting) check the estimated cooking time. Take roast out of the
  oven 10 - 15 minutes before it should be done. You may have to poke a
  hole in the salt crust first before inserting thermometer. Continue
  roasting, if needed, and test temperature again in 5 minutes. To
  remove roast from salt, you may need to use a hammer.  After removing
  crust, use a stiff pastry or vegetable brush to whisk away any
  remaining salt crystals.

      Title: HERBED ROAST LEG OF LAMB WITH ROAST ONIONS &
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Mustard, Dijon
      1 lg Garlic clove; chopped
      1 tb Rosemary, fresh, finely
           -chopped
      1 tb Thyme, fresh; finely
           -chopped
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Wine, dry white
      4 tb Olive oil
      8 lb Lamb, leg of
      2 lb Onion, small white
      2 lg Carrot
  2 1/2 lb Potato

MMMMM---------------------------GRAVY--------------------------------
      1 c  Wine, dry red
      2 c  Broth, beef
      2 tb Butter, unsalted;
           -softened
      3 tb Flour, all purpose
 
    *use small red or white potatoes.
  
  My note: I also insert slices of garlic (medium cloves, quartered)
  into slits made in the roast at about 3 inch intervals with a sharp
  knife. This adds a wonderful subtle flavor to the meat.
  
  Mince the garlic clove and mash to a paste with 1/4 tsp salt. Blanch
  onions in boiling water 2 minutes, drain, and peel. Cut carrots into
  1/2" pieces. Cook potatoes in boiling salted water for 10 minutes,
  drain, and halve.
  
  In a small bowl whisk together the mustard, the garlic paste, the
  chopped rosemary, the chopped thyme, the soy sauce, the white wine,
  and salt & pepper to taste, add 2 Tbsp of the oil in a stream,
  whisking, and whisk the mixture until it is combined well. Brush the
  lamb generously on all sides with some of the mustard mixture, and
  let it marinate in a lightly oiled roasting pan, covered and chilled,
  for at least 6 hours or overnight.
  
  Let the lamb come to room temperature and brush it with the reserved
  mustard mixture. In a bowl toss the onions with 1 Tbsp of the
  remaining oil, add the onions and carrots to the pan, and roast them
  with the lamb in the middle of a preheated 450 degree F. oven for 15
  minutes. In the bowl toss the potatoes with the remaining 1 Tbsp oil
  and add them to the pan. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. and roast
  the lamb and vegetables, stirring the vegetables occasionally, for 1
  hour and 15 minutes, or until a meat thermometer registers 140
  degrees F. for medium-rare meat. Transfer the lamb to a large platter
  and let it stand for 20 minutes. Transfer the onions and the potatoes
  with a slotted spoon to a serving dish, leaving the carrots in the
  pan, and keep them warm, covered.
  
  Make the gravy: Pour off the fat from the pan, add the wine, and
  deglaze the pan over moderately high heat, scraping up the brown
  bits. Boil the mixture until it is reduced by half and strain it
  through a sieve into a saucepan, pressing hard on the carrots.
  
  *** My note: I stopped at this point, adding juices from the lamb
  platter, and used the resulting sauce for the meat--it was delicious!
  
  Add the broth and bring the mixture to a boil. In a small bowl knead
  together the butter and the flour until the mixture is combined well
  and add the mixture to the gravy a little at a time, whisking. Add
  any juices that have accumulated on the platter and salt and pepper
  to taste and simmer the gravy, whisking occasionally, for 3 minutes,
  or until it is thickened.
  
  Spoon some of the potatoes and onions around the lamb, and garnish
  the lamb with fresh thyme and rosemary sprigs. Serve the lamb,
  carved, with the gravy.

      Title: HERBED ROASTED SALMON & VEGETABLES W/LEMON
 Categories: Seafood, Main dish, Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------LEMON CHIVE SAUCE--------------------------
    1/2 c  Wine, white
    1/4 c  Stock, fish
      1 tb Shallots, chopped
      1 tb Juice, lemon
    1/3 c  Cream, heavy
    1/3 c  Butter; in small pieces
      1 tb Chives, chopped
    1/2 ts Peel, lemon, grated

MMMMM---------------------------SALMON--------------------------------
      6    Garlic cloves, crushed
    1/2 c  Oil, olive
      2 ts Rosemary leaves; crumbled
      2 ts Thyme leaves; crumbled
      1 tb Parsley
      3 lb Salmon fillets

MMMMM---------------------ROASTED VEGETABLES--------------------------
      6 sm Carrots
      6 md Potatoes, red
      2    Ears of corn
      2 md Zucchini
      1 lg Bell peppers, red
      1 lg Bell peppers, yellow
           -Herb Marinade (reserved
           -from Herb Roasted Salmon)
 
  Seafood alternatives: snapper, halibut, rockfish, striped bass LEMON
  CHIVE SAUCE: Yes, this is a rich sauce - but worth every calorie!
  Combine wine, fish stock, shallots and lemon juice in a medium sized
  saucepan; boil over high heat until reduced by half (to just under
  1/2 cup). Add cream and boil until sauce reduces to just under 2/3
  cup. Take off heat and slowly whisk in butter then stir in chives and
  lemon peel. (if making sauce ahead, leave out the chives and lemon
  peel. Stir sauce over low heat to rewarm - do not completely melt -
  then add chives and lemon peel) Makes about 1 cup In a small bowl,
  combine the garlic, oil, rosemary and thyme and parsley. Pour about
  2/3 of it into another bowl and reserve for the vegetables. Rinse
  salmon and pat dry. Rub the remaining herb marinade over the fillet
  then season lightly with salt and pepper if desired. Lay fish on a
  lightly oiled rimmed baking sheet or in a shallow roasting pan (you
  can prepare the fish up to this point earlier in the day then
  refrigerate until ready to cook) Bake in a 400 degree oven until
  flesh in center of thickest area is no longer translucent but is
  still very moist, 20 to 25 minutes for a fillet 1.1/4 to 1.1/2 inches
  thick in center. Serve with Roasted Vegetables and Lemon Chive Sauce.
  (Note: Put vegetables in oven to bake 20 to 25 minutes BEFORE putting
  salmon in to bake) Peel carrots and trim stem ends. Cut potatoes into
  eighths. Husk fresh or frozen corn and cut into 1" rounds. Halve
  zucchini lengthwise, then cut diagonally into 2" pieces Quarter and
  seed bell peppers, then cut crosswise into narrow triangles. Place
  vegetables in a roasting pan or in an 11-by 17-inch baking dish and
  toss with reserved herb marinade. Bake, uncovered, in a 400 degree
  oven, until vegetables brown on bottom, about 15 minutes. Stir; cover
  pan and continue baking, stirring once or twice, until potatoes are
  very tender, 20 to 30 minutes more. If cooked bits on pan bottom get
  very dark and you're concerned about burning, add a few Tablespoons
  water or white wine. (If preparing vegetables early in the day, cover
  cut potatoes with water to prevent them from turning dark in the
  refrigerator. Cut and marinating vegetables can also stand, covered,
  at room temperature several hours before cooking) A whole fillet of
  salmon surrounded by brightly colored vegetables is a spectacular
  sight. It is also easy on the cook. You can season the salmon and the
  vegetables early so they'll be ready to go when it's time for baking.
  Big pieces of brightly colored vegetables look quite festive
  alongside salmon. A convenient way to cook the vegetables is in a
  roasting pan (a disposable pan makes clean up really easy) The sides
  are high enough to allow you to place the baking sheets with salmon
  or Herb Toast right on top to bake.

  NOTES:
  
  *  A delicious appetizer or vegetable dish -- I learned this recipe
  from my mother.  I think she originally found it in the _Troy (NY)
  Times Record_. Yield:  Serves 12-20.
  
  *  These can be made up ahead of time and frozen.  If frozen, increase
  cooking time by 10-15 minutes.
  
  *  Herb stuffing mix is a commercial preparation of bread crumbs and
  herbs and seasonings that is packaged for stuffing a turkey or
  chicken. You can make your own if you like.
  
  *  This recipe makes about 80 appetizer-size balls, or about 40 larger
  balls to use as a vegetable dish at a meal.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation.  15-30 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement ok.

      Title: HERBED SUMMER VEGETABLES
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/4 c  Mixed fresh herbs*
           -- loosely packed
      8 oz Feta cheese
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 lb Yellow patty-pan squash
           -- trimmed, cut vertically
           -- in 1/4" thick slices
      8 oz Green beans; trimmed
           -- cut diagonally
           -- in 1/2" pieces
      1 lb Tomatoes*; cored
           -- coarsely chopped
           Salt and pepper; to taste
    1/4 c  Fresh dill; loosely packed
 
  *Oregano, basil and chives.
  
  **Ripe tomatoes are essential to this dish, but beyond that, try any
  vegetable available.  Loomis also suggests trying asparagus, fava
  beans, baby turnips, baby bok choy, scallions or garlic shoots in
  this recipe.
  
  Mince mixed herbs.  Crumble the feta cheese in a small bowl, drizzle
  it with 2 tb. of olive oil, and stir in the minced herbs until
  thoroughly incorporated.  Set aside.
  
  Heat remaining 1 tb. olive oil in a wok or large heavy skillet over
  medium-high heat.  When oil is hot but not smoking, add the squash and
  cook, stirring constantly, until it begins to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.
  Add the beans; toss to mix.  Cook, stirring constantly, until they
  begin to turn a vivid green, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook,
  stirring constantly, until squash is translucent, beans are bright
  green and crisp-tender, and tomatoes have softened, 4 to 5 minutes.
  Season with a little salt and a generous amount of pepper. Remove
  from heat.
  
  Mince dill and add it to the vegetables, mixing well so that it is
  evenly distributed.  Transfer vegetables to a warmed serving platter,
  distribute the seasoned feta cheese on top, and serve immediately.
  
  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

    1/4 c  Fresh oregano; chopped
    1/4 c  Fresh basil; chopped
    1/4 c  Italian parsley; chopped
      2 tb Lemon balm; chopped
 
  Saute onion, bell pepper, garlic and carrots in olive oil in a 4-qt.
  saucepan until vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes). Add
  mushrooms and continue cooking 2 or 3 minutes more.
  
  Add tomatoes, bay leaf, aniseed and wine.  Simmer, uncovered, stirring
  occasionally, until sauce thickens (about 1 to 1 1/2 hours).
  
  Add oregano, basil, parsley and lemon balm; stir and simmer 15 to 20
  minutes longer to let flavors mingle.
  
  Cathy's note:  The recipe says nothing about removing the bay leaf
  afterward, but this is standard practice so that any sharp edges on
  it do not cause discomfort or physical damage to people.
  
  The editors wrote:  "Selecting a basic herb-tomato sauce from the
  many, many dozens that were submitted was [a]...chore. This one edged
  out many other...entries for its simplicity, fresh approach, and the
  short cooking time after the leafy herbs were added. While many
  excellent cooks take the 'less is more' approach and add only
  fractions of teaspoons of herbs, we liked the more assertive style
  here and the surprising and intriguing addition of lemon balm (which
  cooks out to a mellow hint of not-quite-lemon). This sauce depends on
  a greater-than-usual amount of chopped carrot to cut the acidity of
  fresh tomatoes."

      Title: HERBFARM ROSEMARY SHORTBREAD
 Categories: Cookies, Desserts, Harned 1994, Herb/spice
      Yield: 36 Cookies
 
  1 1/2 c  Unsalted butter (3 sticks)
           -- at room temperature
    2/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Fresh rosemary or
      2 ts Dried rosemary
  2 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/2 c  White or brown rice flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar for topping (opt'l.)
 
  Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
  
  Cream butter in a large bowl until pale yellow and light. Add the
  sugar; continue mixing until the mixture is fluffy.
  
  If you are using fresh rosemary, mince it.  If you are using dried
  rosemary, crush it in a mortar and pestle, or by using a rolling pin
  on a flat surface, until it is fine but not a powder.
  
  Add both flours, the salt and the rosemary to the butter mixture; mix
  until thoroughly combined.  The dough will be somewhat soft.
  Refrigerate it for 1 hour, if necessary, so that it is firm enough to
  roll.
  
  Roll the dough out to form a rectangle about 10 x 14" and 1/4" thick.
  Cut cookies into 1 1/2 x 2" rectangles or any other shape you like.
  Place them about 1/2" apart on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle
  them with the sugar topping if desired; bake at 375 F. in the center
  of the oven until they are gold at the edges, 12 to 15 minutes.
  
  Remove the cookies from the oven and transfer them to wire racks to
  cool. Pack in an airtight container. The cookies will keep, their
  flavor improving, for at least a week.
  
  Note:  The author says that these cookies are much better two days
  after they are baked, and suggests planning accordingly.

      Title: HERBOLACE PIE
 Categories: Vegetarian, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Shortcrust pastry
           -- (see note)
      6 oz Curd cheese
      4 oz Cottage cheese
      2 oz (generous) mature cheddar
      4    Eggs
      2 tb Milk (or more)
           Fresh mint, parsley & chives
           Beaten egg to glaze
 
  *Note: Shortcrust pastry should be made with 8 oz flour, preferably
  whole wheat.
  
  Sieve both the soft cheeses to make a smooth mixture. Beat in about 2
  tablespoons each coarsley chopped parsley, mint and chives to make a
  prettily green-flecked mixture. Add salt, pepper and the milk.
  
     Use half the pastry to line a pie plate measuring about 8 1/2
  inches across the top.  Put the cheese mixture into it, make four
  hollows with the back of a spoon and break an egg into each. Season
  the eggs with a pinch of salt, a good grinding of pepper and scatter
  more herbs over the top--at least 3 tablespoons of mint and perhaps 1
  of chives.
  
      Cover with remaining pastry.  Seal, flute, glaze and make a few

      Title: HERBS FOR SEASONING
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No ingredients
 
  Fresh herbs have more zest and flavor than dried herbs. For this
  reason, you are fortunate if your local market carries a selection,
  or if you can grow your own in a garden or window box. Following is a
  list of the most common ones and how they are used:
  
  BASIL - A recognized "mate" for tomato sauces, juices, and tomato
  dishes. Also good in soups and fish cocktails with crab and shrimp.
  Inspiring with veal, lamb, duck, and game; in vegetables like
  eggplant, zucchini, and onions, and in green salads and sauces.
  
  BAY LEAF - Good in stews and pot roasts, fish salads, gravies and
  sauces. As it has a distinct flavor, use sparingly.
  
  CHERVIL - Ideal as a garnish and in salads, soups, omelettes, all
  meats, poultry and game, sauces, and vegetables such as new potatoes
  and asparagus.
  
  DILL - Good with all fish, also with lamb, veal and chicken. Also
  distinctive with many vegetables and salads, and especially in sour
  cream sauces.
  
  MARJORAM - This is a popular herb of which the uses are endless. Good
  in salads, vegetable dishes, omelettes, meat dishes, poultry stuffing
  and sauces.
  
  MINT - Used in fruit c  and carrots, new potatoes, and with lamb.
  Fresh picked leaves may be crushed or used whole as a garnish also in
  dried flakes.
  
  OREGANO - Has a pungent taste. Used in soups, stews, meat balls,
  sausage and pork, stuffings, sauces, and many vegetables.
  
  PARSLEY - Used as a garnish, and also for seasoning and color in
  stuffings, soups, stews, and sauces. Good with fish, meat, poultry,
  vegetable, and egg dishes.
  
  ROSEMARY - Used in fruit compotes, chicken and pea soups, in
  stuffings and stews. Also with meat, lamb, poultry, and game, as well
  as vegetables such as spinach and lima beans.
  
  SAFFRON - Aromatic dried pungent stigmas of this plant (a species of
  crocus) are used to flavor and color, especially curry dishes with
  rice.
  
  SAGE - Has a strong flavor, so use sparingly.  cn be used in
  stuffings, chowders, stews, or gravies.
  
  SAVORY - Used in beans, fish, and pea soups, hearty stews and salads,
  and some sauces.
  
  TARRAGON - Widely used in salads and sauces, soups, egg dishes,
  vegetable, and fish, veal, chicken, and turkey.
  
  THYME - Many dishes benefit from this one: stuffings, stews, sauces,
  fish, meat, cheese and vegetables such as carrots, onions, potatoes
  and peas. Via: RFIX_S 09-28-1994

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 c  (to 8c) bread (high-gluten)
           -flour
      4 tb Dry baking yeast
      6 tb Granulated white sugar or
           -light honey (clover honey
           -is good)
      2 ts Salt
      3 c  Hot water
           A bit of vegetable oil
      1    Gallon water
      5 tb Malt syrup or sugar
           A few handfuls of cornmeal
           Large mixing bowl
           Wire whisk
           Measuring cups and spoons
           Wooden mixing spoon
           Butter knife or baker's
           -dough blade
           Clean, dry surface for
           -kneading
           3 clean, dry kitchen towels
           Warm, but not hot, place to
           -set dough to rise
           Large stockpot
           Slotted spoon
           2 baking sheets
 
  First, pour three cups of hot water into the mixing bowl. The water
  should be hot, but not so hot that you can't bear to put your fingers
  in it for several seconds at a time. Add the sugar or honey and stir
  it with your fingers (a good way to make sure the water is not too
  hot) or with a wire whisk to dissolve. Sprinkle the yeast over the
  surface of the water, and stir to dissolve.
  
  Wait about ten minutes for the yeast to begin to revive and grow.
  This is known as "proofing" the yeast, which simply means that you're
  checking to make sure your yeast is viable. Skipping this step could
  result in your trying to make bagels with dead yeast, which results
  in bagels so hard and potentially dangerous that they are banned
  under the terms of the Geneva Convention.  You will know that the
  yeast is okay if it begins to foam and exude a sweetish, slightly
  beery smell.
  
  At this point, add about three cups of flour as well as the 2 tsp of
  salt to the water and yeast and begin mixing it in. Some people
  subscribe to the theory that it is easier to tell what's going on
  with the dough if you use your hands rather than a spoon to mix
  things into the dough, but others prefer the less physically direct
  spoon. As an advocate of the bare-knuckles school of baking, I
  proffer the following advice: clip your fingernails, take off your
  rings and wristwatch, and wash your hands thoroughly to the elbows,
  like a surgeon. Then you may dive into the dough with impunity.  I
  generally use my right hand to mix, so that my left is free to add
  flour and other ingredients and to hold the bowl steady. Left-handed
  people might find that the reverse works better for them. Having one
  hand clean and free to perform various tasks works best.
  
  When you have incorporated the first three cups of flour, the dough
  should begin to become thick-ish. Add more flour, a half-cup or so at
  a time, and mix each addition thoroughly before adding more flour. As
  the dough gets thicker, add less and less flour at a time. Soon you
  will begin to knead it by hand (if you're using your hands to mix the
  dough in the first place, this segue is hardly noticeable).  If you
  have a big enough and shallow enough bowl, use it as the kneading
  bowl, otherwise use that clean, dry, flat countertop or tabletop
  mentioned in the "Equipment" list above. Sprinkle your work surface
  or bowl with a handful of flour, put your dough on top, and start
  kneading. Add bits of flour if necessary to keep the dough from
  sticking (to your hands, to the bowl or countertop, etc....). Soon
  you should have a nice stiff dough. It will be quite elastic, but
  heavy and stiffer than a normal bread dough. Do not make it too dry,
  however... it should still give easily and stretch easily without
  tearing.
  
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with one of your
  clean kitchen towels, dampened somewhat by getting it wet and then
  wringing it out thoroughly. If you swish the dough around in the
  bowl, you can get the whole ball of dough covered with a very thin
  fil of oil, which will keep it from drying out.
  
  Place the bowl with the dough in it in a dry, warm (but not hot)pace,
  free from drafts.  Allow it to rise until doubled in volume. Some
  people try to accelerate rising by putting the dough in the oven,
  where the pilot lights keep the temperature slightly elevated. If
  it's cold in your kitchen, you can try this, but remember to leave
  the oven door open or it may become too hot and begin to kill the
  yeast and cook the dough. An ambient temperature of about 80 degrees
  Farenheit (25 centigrades) is ideal for rising dough.
  
  While the dough is rising, fill your stockpot with about a gallon of
  water and set it on the fire to boil. When it reaches a boil, add the
  malt syrup or sugar and reduce the heat so that the water just barely
  simmers; the surface of the water should hardly move. Submitted By

      Title: HERE'S A BAGEL RECIPE #2
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
  Once the dough has risen, turn it onto your work surface, punch it
  down, and divide immediately into as many hunks as you want to make
  bagels. For this recipe, you will probably end up with about 15
  bagels, so you will divide the dough into 15 roughly even-sized
  hunks. Begin forming the bagels. There are two schools of thought on
  this. One method of bagel formation involves shaping the dough into a
  rough sphere, then poking a hole through the middle with a finger and
  then pulling at the dough around the hole to make the bagel. This is
  the hole-centric method. The dough-centric method involves making a
  long cylindrical "snake" of dough and wrapping it around your hand
  into a loop and mashing the ends together. Whatever you like to do is
  fine. DO NOT, however, give in to the temptation of using a doughnut
  or cookie cutter to shape your bagels. This will pusht them out of
  the realm of Jewish Bagel Authenticity and give them a distinctly
  Protestant air. The bagels will not be perfectly shaped. They will
  not be symmetrical. This is normal. This is okay. Enjoy the
  diversity. Just like snowflakes, no two genuine bagels are exactly
  alike.
  
  Begin to preheat the oven to 400 degrees Farenheit.
  
  Once the bagels are formed, let them sit for about 10 minutes. They
  will begin to rise slightly.  Ideally, they will rise by about
  one-fourth volume... a technique called "half-proofing" the dough. At
  the end of the half-proofing, drop the bagels into the simmering
  water one by one. You don't want to crowd them, and so there should
  only be two or three bagels simmering at any given time.  The bagels
  should sink first, then gracefully float to the top of the simmering
  water. If they float, it's not a big deal, but it does mean that
  you'll have a somewhat more bready (and less bagely) texture.  Let
  the bagel simmer for about three minutes, then turn them over with a
  skimmer or a slotted spoon. Simmer another three minutes, and then
  lift the bagels out of the water and set them on a clean kitchen
  towel that has been spread on the countertop for this purpose. The
  bagels should be pretty and shiny, thanks to the malt syrup or sugar
  in the boiling water.
  
  Once all the bagels have been boiled, prepare your baking sheets by
  sprinkling them with cornmeal.  Then arrange the bagels on the
  prepared baking sheets and put them in the oven. Let them bake for
  about 25 mintues, then remove from the oven, turn them over and put
  them back in the oven to finish baking for about ten minutes more.
  This will help to prevent flat-bottomed bagels.
  
  Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks, or on a dry clean towels
  if you have no racks.  Do not attempt to cut them until they are
  cool... hot bagels slice abominably and you'll end up with a wadded
  mass of bagel pulp. Don't do it.
  
  Serve with good cream cheese.
  
  TO CUSTOMIZE BAGELS: After boiling but before baking, brush the
  bagels with a wash made of 1 egg white and 3 tablespoons ice water
  beaten together. Sprinkle with the topping of your choice: poppy,
  sesame, or caraway seeds, toasted onion or raw garlic bits, salt or
  whatever you like. Just remember that bagels are essentially a savory
  baked good, not a sweet one, and so things like fruit and sweet
  spices are really rather out of place. Submitted By

  minutes. Mix milk, remaining sugar, flour and yeast mixture. Place in
  plastic or glass containter about the size of a 5-quar ice cream
  bucket. Stir, using only a wooden sppon or paddle, as metal retards
  growth. Cover loosely and let stand in a warm place overnight. The
  next day, refrigerate. Stir each day with a wooden spoon to retard
  spoilage. On the fifth day, measure out one cup to bake with. Measure
  out one cup for gift. Feed remaining starter one cup flour, one cup
  milk and one-half cup sugar. Stir well. Refrigerate and stir daily.
  On the 10th day, measure out one cup, if desired, to give to a
  friend. You should have enough left over to use in a recipe, plus
  extra to feed as before and refrigerate. Thereafter, use the starter
  almost daily or as desired, feeding every five days. From: Pat

      1 c  Sugar
      1 pk Dry yeast, dissolved in 1/4
           -cup warm water
 
  1.  In a large glass or ceramic bowl, combine 1 cup of the milk, 1
  cup of the flour, the sugar and the dissolved yeast. Using a non-
  metal spoon, beat until smooth and creamy. Stir in the remaining 1
  cup milk and 1 cup flour.  Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set
  in a moderately warm spot (about 70F.)  Let stand for 24 hours, at
  which point the batter should smell pleasantly sour. 2. Transfer to a
  tightly covered glass or plastic container and place in the
  refrigerator. Stir with a nonmetal spoon once a day for 5 days. 3. To
  use the starter, measure out what you need and let it come to room
  temperature. Replenish it with equal parts of flour and milk, plus
  half a part of sugar. (For example, if you remove 1 cup of starter,
  stir in 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/4 cup sugar.) The starter
  may be stored in the refrigerator indefinitely, but flavor develops
  best when batter is used and replenished often.

  ***** HERMAN'S STARTER *****
  
  DIRECTIONS *-+*
  
  In large bowl mix flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Gradually stir in the
  water; beat or whisk until smooth. Cover with towel; set in warm (80
  to 85 degree)draft-free place-the kitchen or other warm room in
  summer, or in cold weather on top of insulated furnace or radiator,
  on a buffer such as a folded towel or pillow. Stir 2 or 3 times a day
  for about 3 days or until starter is bubbly and produces a yeast
  aroma. Transfer to a larger bowl, large jar or plastic container.
  Cover partially(tilt lid or punch holes in plastic cover);
  refrigerate. Makes about 1 1/2 to 2 cups starter, depending on
  thickness. It can be creamy or as thick as dough because of room
  conditions, the age of "Herman" and other variables.
  
  THE FLAVOR OF THIS STARTER EVOLVES AS IT AGES-MILDLY SWEET WHEN
  YOUNG, MORE LIKE SOURDOUGH WHEN OLDER.
  
  Herman is replenished only after you use it. If that is going to be
  longer than 14 days, then put it in the freezer until ready to use.

    1/4 c  Warm water
      1 c  Sugar
      2 c  All purpose white flour
      2 c  Milk (see note)
 
    DAY,1: Sprinkle yeast over warm water.Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar
  and let stand a few minutes until yeast is active and swelling.Combine
  remaining sugar,flour and milk in a 4 t0 6 quart glass,plastic or
  pottery bowl or container.(Do not use metal bowls or utensils as
  these may retard starter growth.)With a wooden spoon,stir in active
  yeast mixture.Cover loosely with a towel so Herman can breathe.Let
  stand in a warm draft free place overnight.
    DAYS,2,3,and 4:Stir daily with a wooden spoon.Keep covered.Keep
  cool.
    DAY,5: Stir in 1/2 cup sugar,1 cup milk and 1 cup flour.Let stand 24
  hours.
    DAYS,6,7,8,and 9:Stir daily with a wooden spoon.
    DAY,10: Repeat DAY 5,stirring in 1/2 cup sugar,1 cup milk and 1 cup
  flour.
    THIS gives you enough starter to use freely in recipes and/or give
  away. Herman may be replenished as needed but can go no more than 5
  days at room temperature between feedings.After feeding,wait 24 hours
  before using the renewed starter.
    DAILY stirring helps keep yeast mold from forming.
    Most directions specify that Herman not be refrigerated since cooler
  temperatures slow the growth and "souring" of the starter.It
  is,however,a safer course for busy cooks with fast growing
  startersHerman also is freezer-friendly and may be kept on ice
  between baking impulses if you get board.
    NOTE: If desired,substitute butter-milk for milk in starter for more
  flavor and less fat.If more starter is needed,additions may be
  doubled when 2 or more cups of starter are used.....

  Place over medium heat and stir until the shortening is melted.
  Transfer to a large mixing bowl to cool.
  
  2.  When the mixture is barely warm to the touch, stir in the
  dissolved yeast.  Blend in the sourdough starter. Add 2 cups of the
  flour and beat with a spoon until smooth. Gradually blend in
  additional flour until the dough becomes too difficult to stir. turn
  out onto a floured surface and knead in as much of the remaining
  flour as necessary to form a cohesive dough.  Continue kneading in
  flour until the dough is soft yet no longer sticks to the work
  surface. Transfer to a greased bowl and cover with a clean kitchen
  towel. Set aside to rise until double in bulk.
  
  3.  Generously grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.  Punch the dough down,
  then turn it out onto a floured surface. Shape it into 2 loaves and
  place them in the prepared pans. Cover and set aside to rise. When
  double in bulk, bake in a preheated 375 oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or
  until the crust is nicely browned. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes, then
  turn out. Complete cooling on the rack.

  refrigerate, loosely covered, and stir each day. This is very
  important with Wheat'n'Honey Herman Starter as more gases form in the
  container and are released during stirring. Formation of this gas may
  cause the starter to appear darker on top before stirring each day,
  but this is OK. On the 5th day measure out 1 c. Herman for baking and
  another cup to give to a friend, if you wish, then feed the Herman
  you have left, thusly: SEE ABOVE From day 5 on you may bake with
  Herman any day you wish, always making sure you have one full cup
  left for feeding. Feed Herman every five days. If you have a lot
  left, feed him only 1 T. honey or brown sugar. If you have one cup or

    1/2 lb Dried whole green peas
      2 qt Cold Water
      1 lb Pork leg
      1 ts Dried marjoram
      1 pn Dry mustard
      1 ds Salt
      1 ds Ground Pepper
 
  This Finnish pea soup can be made well in advance. You can double or
  triple the recipe and freeze it in useful quantities. Malla
  Karhusaari also suggests reducing the cooking time by using a
  pressure cooker or microwave to prepare it. Rinse peas and soak in
  cold water in large port for 8 hours or overnight. Bring peas and
  soaking water to the boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for one hour
  or until peas begin to soften. Add pork and continue to simmer for
  two to three hours, until peas and meat ar thoroughly cooked. When
  meat is tender, remove it from pot, discard skin and bone, cut meat
  in cubes and return to soup. You may need to add more water to pot
  for desired consistency. Season with marjoram, mustard, salt and
  pepper. Heat to blend flavors and serve hot. Serves 6. From The

  1. Lay the herring fillets in a shallow baking dish. Add the
  buttermilk, cover and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
  
  2. On the next day, drain and rinse the herring fillets well, then
  cut into bite-size pieces. Place the herring in a shallow glass or
  porcelain baking dish.
  
  3. Combine the sour cream, yogurt, onion, apples, pickles,

           No ingredients
 
  MOUTHWATERING SELECTIONS FROM "THE GREAT AMERICAN CHOCOLATE COMPANY"
  
  Americans have enjoyed Hershey's chocolate since 1894 when Hershey's
  baking chocolate and cocoa were introduced and Hershey Chocolate
  Company, today known as Hershey Foods Corporation, was established.
  
  As The Great American Chocolate Company celebrates its 100th
  anniversary, America's love affair with chocolate continues with such
  favorite treats as Hershey's milk chocolate bars, Hershey's Kisses
  chocolate, Hershey's syrup, Hershey's Cookies 'n' Mint chocolate bars
  and the recently introduced Hershey's Hugs chocolates.
  
  In celebration of the centennial, the Hershey Kitchens have created
  this special anniversary booklet for certified chocolate lovers who
  have helped make the Hershey's name virtually synonymous with
  chocolate.
  
  This booklet is filled with some of the classic recipes our mothers
  and grandmothers prepared, new recipes that incorporate some of
  Hershey's most recent products, and even some lighter creations with
  Hershey's cocoa, which is naturally low in fat. We hope you will take
  time to try some in your kitchen.
  
  From our family to yours, here's to another 100 years of sweet
  success!

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 3/4 c  Unbleached Flour, Unsifted
      1 ts Baking Powder
      1 ts Baking Soda
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Vegetable Shortening Or
           Vegetable Oil

    1/4 c  PLUS 2 to 3 Tbls Hot Water
      1 c  Milk Mixed With 1 Tbls
           Water (To Make Sour Milk)
 
  This has been one of the most popular cakes Hershey has ever
  introduced. I have made it since the 1950's so I would consider it a
  classic. Grease the bottoms and sides of two 9 X 1 1/2-inch layer
  cake pans and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, blending
  well, and set aside.  Cream the shortening and sugar, with an
  electric mixer set on high, and beat in the eggs and vanilla extract
  and continue beating until light and fluffy.  Blend the cocoa into
  the hot water to make a smooth paste. Gradually add the cocoa mixture
  to the creamed mixture, stirring to blend well.  Add the flour
  mixture alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture, beating
  well after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared pans.
  Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the tops
  spring back when lightly pressed. Cool on racks for 10 minutes and
  remove from the pans to cool completely. Frost with
  Chocolate-Buttercream Frosting (Next Recipe).

  Hershey's Chocolate Syrup
  
  I  don't have the exact recipe, but this is what I make. I call it
  after years of experimenting, as I am a fan of chocolate milk. The
  proportions can vary though, if you use a different brand of cocoa,
  so... Then again, some people like their syrup sweeter, however, I
  like mine to taste like cocoa.
  
  Chocolate Syrup
  
  7/8 cup cocoa 8/8 cup sugar (ie. 1 cup) 9/8 cup water (1 and 1/8
  cups) 1 t salt 1 t vanilla
  
  Combine  first  four ingredients, and bring slowly to a boil while

  Besides the ususal herbal tea blends you can try:
  
  From: wow4now@aol.com (Wow4Now) Newsgroups: rec.food.cooking
  
  Some edible flowers are rose, hibiscus, society garlic, daylily,
  violet, and many other.  If you eat them, be sure that they have not
  been sprayed. I grow my own and add them to salads.  I like society
  garlic and hibiscus the most for salads.  Kind of garlic and pepper
  flavors. Candied violets and rose make great pastery decorations. Tea
  is made from rose (rose hips) and hibiscus (red zinger).

  From: paulhinr@nando.net (Paul Hinrichs)
  
  Extracted from an article about smoking cajun sausage:
  
  At midnight, I started smoking the andouille. This is not normally a
  very creative process, but this time I decided to try something
  different. Cliff the Butcher carries this inexpensive line of herbs
  by a company called El Charrito; and several months ago I picked up a
  little bag of Flor De Jamaica - dried hibiscus flowers - for 99
  cents. Never figured out what to use them in, so last night I burned
  'em in the smoker. The smoke was very fruity and fragrant and,
  hopefully, non-poisonous.
  
  After I ran out of hibiscus, I went to the standard, hickory. A
  couple of pans of that and now the andouille is just cookin' at 175.
  The smoke has made it an even deeper red and if I can't eat this
  stuff I'll use it for Christmas tree ornaments.                Paul

      2 sm Carrots, chopped
      2    Celery stalks, chopped
      1    Green or red pepper,
           Chopped
    1/2    Head green cabbage chopped
      1    Or more cloves garlic
     28 oz Can chopped or crushed
           Tomatoes
      2 c  Tomato or tomato-vegetable
           Juice (more or less)
      1 c  Salsa
      1 c  Raw brown rice, mostly
           Cooked (you can use
           Leftover)
        x  Herbs and pepper to taste--I
           Usually use oregano and
           Basil
        x  Supermarket grade Balsamic
           Vinegar
 
  Puree the onion, carrots, celery, green pepper, cabbage, and garlic
  (not all at once!) in a blender, using as much tomato juice as
  necessary to aid the process. Combine with tomatoes, salsa and herbs,
  and cook about 15 or 20 minutes.  If the rice is partially cooked,
  add it with everything else; if fully cooked, add near the end of
  cooking. If the soup is too thick for your taste, add tomato juice or
  water. Just before serving, stir in a little balsamic vinegar.
  
  I serve this as a main dish, along with bread. Probably makes about 5
  or 6 servings.

 Categories: Hungarian, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Just a faint memory up here what with our fading daylight but well
  worth saving for next year.  This series includes recipes from
  Europey, Turkey and one honest to goodness Ozzy recipe.
  
  Cold fruit soups are popular in central Europe and this recipe for
  strawberry soup from Hungary. Obviously it is not the sort of thing
  one makes when strawberries are expensive, but at the peak of their
  season it makes a good and unusual starter.
  
  Hull 4 punnets [?] of strawberries into a large bowl (reserving about
  6 to 10 strawberries, depending on their size, for decoration),
  sprinkle generously with sugar and crush thoroughly with a fork.
  
  Add 1 litre of liquid made up of the juice of half a lemon and a 50-
  50 mix of red wine and water.  Taste and if necessary sweeten further
  or add a little more lemon juice. Chill and decorate with sliced
  reserved strawberries before serving, preferably in clear glass bowls.
  
  Makes 3 servings.

  1 1/3 c  -Water
  1 1/3 tb Vegetable oil

   Much better than the store bought diet breads which use "sawdust
  fiber" as filler.  This is a tasty, dense loaf. Makes good
  sandwiches. The recipe is based on a formula devised for superior
  nutrition in bread by faculty at Cornell University.  Wheat germ, soy
  flour and nonfat dry milk are added to each cup of flour in the
  Cornell Formula, this recipe makes it easier.

      Title: HIGH-PROTIEN BLUEBERRY MUFFINS
 Categories: Breads, Muffins
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
    1/3 c  Brown sugar, packed
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/3 c  Wheat germ
    1/4 c  Dry milk
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Fresh/frozen blueberries
    1/4 c  Brown sugar, packed
    1/3 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
 
  Cream together butter and sugar.  Beat in the egg.
  
  In another bowl, combine whole wheat flour, wheat germ, dry milk and
  baking powder mixing well.
  
  Add dry ingredients alternately with milk to the butter mixture. Stir
  until combined, but do not overbeat. Fold in blueberries.
  
  Fill greased muffin pans.  Sprinkle Crumb Topping over each muffin.
  
  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Let muffins cool a few minutes
  before removing from pan.
  
  CRUMB TOPPING:  Combine 1/4 cup packed, brown sugar with 1/3 cup whole
  wheat flour and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Cut in 1/4 cup butter or
  margarine.
  
  TIPS:  Butter, especially sweet butter, gives the muffins a special
  taste. If sweet butter is used, add 1/2 teaspoon salt to dry
  ingredients.
  
  NUTRITION NOTE:  The wheat germ "complements" the flour and almost
  doubles the protien value.  The dry milk "supplements" the flour and
  increases the protien value by 50%

           -juice cocktail
  2 1/2 tb Blackberry brandy or kirsch
           -(cherry brandy)
           Or orange juice
      1    Envelope plus 1 1/2 tsp
           -unflavored gelatin
      1 lb Red or black plums, pitted
           -and chopped (5-6 medium)
      1 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 lb Fresh peaches, peeled,
           -pitted and chopped (4-5
           -medium)
  2 1/2 c  Fresh blackberries or black
           -or red raspberries
      1 tb Finely grated lemon zest
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
     15 sl Thin-sliced homemade-style
           -white bread (such as
 
  Pepperidge Farm), crusts removed
  
  Line a 2-quart bowl or mold with plastic wrap, carefully smoothing
  the wrap onto the bottom and sides so that the plastic hangs 1 inch
  over sides. In a small bowl, mix cranberry juice and brandy, kirsch
  or orange juice and sprinkle gelatin over the surface; let stand 5
  minutes until softened.
  
  Combine plums, sugar and gelatin mixture in a medium-sized saucepan.
  Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring for 3-4 minutes until
  the gelatin dissolves.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 7 minutes.
  Add peaches and simmer for about 5 minutes longer, until the peaches
  are almost tender. Stir in blackberries, lemon zest and cinnamon and
  simmer 3-4 minutes longer, until the berries begin to release their
  juice. Refrigerate.
  
  Arrange bread slices in the bottom of the bowl or mold, cutting as
  needed and fitting them tightly together. Arrange more slices all
  around the sides of the dish, fitting them together tightly and
  smoothly. Taking care not to dislodge the bread, spoon the fruit
  mixture into the center of the dish, tilting the dish to distribute
  the fruit evenly. If the bread extends more than 1/4 inch above the
  layer of fruit, trim it with a knife. Cover the fruit with another
  layer of bread, patting it down firmly. Stack several saucers or
  small plates on the bread to weight down the pudding. Refrigerate for
  at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.
  
  To serve:  Invert the bowl over a serving plate, tugging the
  overhanging plastic wrap to loosen the pudding from the dish. Center
  the pudding on the serving plate and peel off the plastic wrap.
  Serve immediately, cut into wedges.  Serves 6.

      8 oz Medium oatmeal
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 oz Dripping or lard
      3 tb Hot water (or more)
 
  Sift salt and oatmeal in a roomy bowl.  Put on the gridle or a heavy
  frying pan to heat.  Bring the water to the boil with the fat. Pour
  into a well in the oatmeal. Work into a stiff dough and cut in half.
  Roll out on a floured board to the size of a dinner plate and about
  1/8-inch thick. Cut into quarters or farles.
  
  Test the gridle's heat by holding your hand over it. Lay on one of the
  quartered rounds.  When the farles are ready, the surface stops
  steaming and begins to look dry and white. Turn them and do the other
  side. Dry off the oatcakes and lightly brown the edges in a hot oven
  or under the grill - they should curl up to the fire to prove that
  you have made your own.

      Title: HIGHLAND SAUSAGE ROLL
 Categories: Meats, Main dish, Appetizers, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     10 oz Venison (trimmed weight)
      6 oz Belly of pork (trimmed wt.)
      2 oz Pitted prunes
      1 sm Onion
           Remains of a pot of tea
      3 tb Port
           Allspice, thyme or Worcester
      1 lb Ready-made puff pastry
           Beaten egg to glaze
 
  Mince the meats fairly finely, chop the onion very finely and mix
  together. Season with a good grinding of pepper - but no salt - and
  some allspice, thyme or a few shakes of Worcester sauce. Pour on the
  port and mix well, then cover and leave for several hours or
  overnight to allow the flavours to blend.  Cover the prunes with cold
  tea and leave to soak for several hours.
  
  Season the sausagemeat with salt and roll it into a long, fat sausage
  shape.  Roll the pastry out to a rectangle and lay the "sausage" down
  the length of it. Lay the whole drained prunes on top of the meat.
  Damp one long edge with beaten egg, roll up carefully and seal.
  Alternatively you may like to enclose the sausage in a decorative
  pastry plait. In this case, roll the pastry out to a square, lay the
  "sausage" down the centre and place the whole drained prunes on top.
  Cut the pastry diagonally into 1/2-inch strips on either side of the
  meat. Damp the end of each pastry strip with beaten egg then fold the
  strips alternately from each side, over the meat to create a plait
  effect. Seal the pastry ends.
  
  Slide the pastry parcel on to a damp baking sheet and glaze the top.
  If you have made a sausage roll, decorate it with pastry leaves and
  make one or two steam slits in the top of the pastry. Bake at 425 F
  (220 C) gas mark 4 for a further 25 minutes or so.

  water. In 3 times the amount of warm water, soak for 10 to 15
  minutes. Remove the hijiki with a tea strainer. (Sand and pebbles
  will sink to the bottom of the bowl.)  Return to fine-mesh strainer
  and drain off excess water. Grate the carrots into matchstick
  slivers. Dip the age puff for 30 seconds in boiling water, and cut
  into matchstick slivers. Place tofu in a heated skillet and mash with
  a spatula. Let it simmer in its own water until reduced to small
  crumbs. Snap the ends off the green beans and place in boiling water
  for 1 to 2 minutes. Immerse in iced water, drain, and cut into
  1/2-inch-long pieces.
  
  B.)   In a heated skillet, saute sesame oil, hijiki, carrots, age,
  and tofu (all completely drained of water). When ingredients have
  acquired a shiny appearance, add dashijiru, shoyu, sake and mirin.
  Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has
  been absorbed. Turn off heat and add green beans.
  
  C.)   Place B in serving dish, sprinkle with sauteed sesame seeds. If
  you like, add seven-taste pepper to taste.

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------CANDY CLASS, SUGARCRAFT-----------------------
 
  ...Learn all the secrets of really GREAT candy making! *The first
  thing that should be done each day, before you start, is to TEST YOUR
  THERMOMETER! To do: immerse therm. in cold water. Bring to a boil.
     At sea level water boils at 212 degrees <on a sunny day.> If your
  water boils at 210 degrees, you should reduce the cooking time by 2
  degrees. Most of the time, water boils here about 208 d. Try not to
  cook candies on a rainy day. The barometric pressure, when the air is
  heavy, holds the mercury in your thermometer down. "Make candy when
  the sun shines," motto of a good candy maker. *I recommend a TAYLOR
  or WILTON thermometer. Use a thin (good quality) pan for candies that
  MUST STAY IN THE PAN for any length of time for cooling. If you leave
  the thermometer in the pan, you may notice the temp. rising even
  after the candy is removed fro the stove. Using a heavy pan, your
  candy will burn, in this case. Use a HEAVY PAN for fudges, fondants,
  etc., that are to be dumped immediately. Dolores McCann, OH-- teacher.

      Title: HIPPO POT DE MOUSSE
 Categories: Mousse
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 oz Semisweet chocolate
      2 oz Bittersweet chocolate
      2 c  Heavy cream,
           -well-chilled (whipping
           -cream will do nicely)
      1 ts Almond extract
           -(optional)
 
  Melt the chocolate together in the top of a double boiler. Be careful
  to do this slowly, so as not to burn the chocolate, and to keep all
  moisture away from the pot. Let the chocolate cool for five minutes.
  
  While the chocolate cools, whip the cream and almond extract together
  until very stiff.  Gently fold the cooled chocolate into the whipped
  cream. There will be many flecks of chocolate in the mixture.
  
  If you're not going to eat it all yourself, spoon into six large wine
  glasses. Chill one hour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Extremely quick and easy chocolate mousse -- This is an adaptation
  of a very easy chocolate mousse recipe from Sandra Boynton's
  hilarious book, "Chocolate, the Consuming Passion."  It requires none
  of the laborious preparation that most French mousse recipes call
  for, and really optimizes the effort needed to consume the chocolate,
  which is, after all, what this is all about. Yield: Serves one to six
  people.
  
  *  If you're careful, you can also melt the chocolate in a microwave
  oven, in its wrapper. If you try this, be especially mindful of the
  semisweet chocolate, as the sugar therein caramelizes very quickly,
  leading to an awful mess (and ruined chocolate).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour chilling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: HISTORY OF CHILI~ WITH ORIGINAL RECIPE
 Categories: Chilis, Copycat, Info, Beef
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Ingredients:
      3 lb Ground or cubed chuck
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 qt Water
      1 ts Of Salt or to taste
     10    Garlic cloves, chopped
      3 oz Chile powder...I like
           -McCormicks
      1 ts Ground cumin (comino)
      1 ts Oregano
      1 ts Cayene pepper...more or less
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Sugar
      3 tb Paprika
      3 tb Flour
      6 tb Masa (fine ground corn meal)
 
  The first "chili" recipes appeared in West Texas at the turn of the
  century.  They may have had their origin from old Mexican recipes, but
  since most cowboys couldn't read...or for that matter, cook very good,
  chili most probably got it's start due to the availability of spices
  and other ingredients available in the area. A lot of ingredients
  available to us now were just not available then. Most chili
  consisted of beef, cumin, pepper, sugar, paprika, garlic, and masa to
  thicken. Tomatoes were seasonal and usually not available. Chili
  powder was not manufactured at the time...They used dried chili's
  (spanish for peppers)...most west texas cowboys were Mexican.
   Most of the original chili did not have beans due to the time
  required to soak and cook them...chuck wagons did not appear til
  later in history and even then, on most ranches, the cowboy was on
  his own and didn't have time to watch beans all day.
  
  The following recipe is based on the original recipes...
  
  CHILI
  
  In a large skillet, saute meat in oil until browned. Add water and
  simmer 1 1/2 to 2 hours. In a small bowl, mix chili powder, salt,
  garlic, cumin, oregano, cayene pepper, black pepper, sugar and
  paprika. Add to skillet. Simmer 30 minutes...cooking longer will
  cause spices to lose flavor. In a small bowl mix flour and masa. Wisk
  flour masa mixture into chili...stirring constantly to prevent
  sticking. Bring mixture back to simmer until thickened.  Remove from
  heat. Serve over beans, rice, hot dogs, enchiladas, burritos, or eat
  plain. Cheese (cheddar, longhorn, queso blanco,etc.) goes well on top.

      Title: HOBEE'S COFFEE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Flour (unbleached),
           -sifted
      1 c  Sugar,  granulated
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Sour cream
    1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/4 c  Blueberries, fresh,
           -optional (or other
           -fruit, or nuts such
           -as walnuts)
           Vegetable oil

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      5 tb Sugar,  granulated
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large mixing bowl, resift sift
  flour with baking power, baking soda, salt and about 1 cup of sugar.
  
  In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, sour cream and vanilla.
  Add egg mixture to flour mixture and beat until smooth.
  
  Oil a 9-inch square baking pan (you can also use an 8 inch square
  pan, or anything of similar surface area, if you increase the baking
  time by about 5 minutes).
  
  Spread the batter in the pan.  If you are using fruit or nuts,
  scatter them over the batter and stir a little bit so that they stay
  in the top layer.
  
  In a small bowl, mix about 5 T sugar with the butter and cinnamon
  with a sturdy fork, until they are blended and resemble cornmeal
  (i.e., you should have a mixture of fine crumbs, not a smooth
  mixture). Sprinkle topping over batter. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until
  a clean toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out dry.
  Cool slightly; serve warm or at room temperature.  Don't ruin it by
  serving it with salted butter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Coffee cake from "Hobee's Haven" restaurant here in Silicon Valley
  (usually just called "Hobee's") serves a lot of brunch food, and as
  far as I can tell they always include a piece of their coffee cake
  with each order. Frankly, I don't care for breakfast, nor do I
  approve of places at which the only kind of tea you can order reeks
  of orange and cinnamon... but the coffee cake is pretty good. This is
  their recipe, printed in an advertising flyer for the shopping center
  they inhabit; it's quite easy.
  
  *  All ingredients and bowls should be a room temperature before you
  start; this is particularly true for the butter.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10-15 minutes preparation, 20-30 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

     24 ea Chicken Wings, Separated
      2 tb Vegetable Oil
    1/4 ts Garlic Powder
      3 tb Habanero Sauce
      3 tb Tabasco Sauce
           Ground Red Pepper to taste
      1 tb White Vinegar
    1/4 c  Brown Sugar
      1 c  Bleu Cheese Salad Dressing
           Leaf Lettuce for platter
 
  These chicken wings are quite easy to prepare. Adjust the amount of
  Tabasco sauce and Habanero sauce to your own tastes. I recommend
  though that you just cool them by dipping them in the bleu cheese
  salad dressing rather than decreasing the hot sauces. þ Preheat oven
  to 375øF. þ In a medium sized mixing bowl combine vegetable oil,
  garlic powder,
    Tabasco sauce, habanero sauce, vinegar and brown sugar. þ Separate
  tips from wings. þ Place tips and wings on cookie sheet(s). þ Using a
  pastry brush, coat the wings with the sauce mixture. þ Sprinkle
  ground red pepper over wings and tips. þ Bake wings for 15 to 20
  minutes or until browning has occurred. þ Arrange wings on leaf
  lettuce and serve with your favorite beverage. þ Dip wings in bleu
  cheese salad dressing for some cooling affect. NOTE: These wings can
  also be cooked on the barbeque. Wings should be
        grilled for the same amount of time over medium high heat coals.

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 tb Soy sauce,(dark/light/usual)
      2 tb Peanut butter/black bean pas
      1 tb Honey/molasses
      2 ts White vinegar
    1/8 ts Garlic powder
      2 ts Sesame seed oil
     20 dr Chinese-style hot sauce
    1/8 ts Pepper
 
  *The original without the variations stolen by Matt Giwer from AP
  Recipes credited to Dee Wang who advised peanut butter. *EXPERIMENT!
  Now you have control of the taste. Lighter for chicken and pork,
  stronger for beef and game.  Sweeter for Dim Sum. *The commercial
  recipe is presumably the black bean paste.
   I presume they are the same as Mexican/Spanish black beans.
  *Different types of soy, molasses, some of the oil being hot pepper
  oil, other styles of pepper sauce.  All kinds of variations. However,
  with light soy and honey, the taste of peanut dominates. *Simply mix
  together. At first it does not appear like it will mix but   keep at
  it just a bit longer and you have Hoisin.  Letting it rest does not
  appear to improve the taste noticeably.

  The big secret he says is to then let the batter sit for 20 minutes
  stirring occasionally to let the sugar dissolve for the desired taste
  and texture.
  
  Evenly divide batter into two six inch rounds and bake at 325 for
  20-24 minutes.  Turn the baking sheet a half turn midway through the
  baking time.
  
  Allow to cool for 4 minutes, then cut each round into 4 to 6 wedges.
  Allow to cool another 30 minutes.
  
  Heat chocolate in a double boiler, stirring constantly until smooth,
  about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and continue stirring until
  temperature drops to 90 degrees.

  shaped cutters work best). Place on ungreased baking sheets.

      Title: HOLIDAY BAKED OYSTERS
 Categories: Seafood, Holiday
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:
      4 c  Firm white bread (Italian or
           -French or sourdough)
    1/2 c  Butter
           Salt and cayenne pepper

  fresh ones ARE best,  thawed, frozen oysters *may* be used. If you
  wish, prepare  the dish and refrigerate it for several hours before
  baking. Or, on  the  other hand,  you can cut and brown the bread
  cubes ahead of time. The rest can be finished in minutes, once the
  bread is browned.
  
  Remove the crusts from the bread.  Cut the bread into quarter-inch
  cubes; in a large skillet, melt half the butter. Add 2 cups of bread
  cubes and toss  over LOW HEAT until they're golden-brown. Sprinkle
  the cubes lightly with salt and caynne, stirring constantly.
  
  Brown the remaining cubes in the remaining butter. Sprinkle again
  with the cayenne and the salt.
  
  Cover  the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish with 1/3 of the bread
  cubes; top the bread evenly with half the oysters, sprinkle with salt
  and cayenne, half the lemon juice and half the onion. Cover with 1/3
  of the bread cubes and sprinkle with salt,  cayenne, the rest of the
  lemon juice and the onion.  Pour in the cream, and top with the last
  third of the bread cubes. Sprinkle with paprika to make pretty.
  
  Bake at 325 degrees for 25 to 35 minutes and serve *immediately*.

      Title: HOLIDAY FRUIT PUNCH
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------ICE RING-------------------------------
      5 c  Orange juice
      5    Limes
           Marachino cherries

MMMMM---------------------------PUNCH--------------------------------
      4 c  Pineapple juice, chilled
      3 c  Grapefruit juice, chilled
  1 1/2 c  Orange juice, chilled
    1/2 c  Lime juice
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3 c  Ginger ale, chilled
 
  To prepare ice ring, pour 2 1/2 cups of the orange juice into 6-cup
  ring mold; freeze until firm.
  
  To make lime rose, use a very sharp knife and starting at one end of
  lime, cut a continuous 1-inch wide strip in spiral fashion, taperin
  to the opposite end to remove. Curl the strip, peel side out, into a
  rose shape.
  
  Pour 1 1/4 cups orange juice over frozen juice in ring. Arrange lime
  roses in juice, right side up; frreeze until firm. Garnish with
  cherries. Pour remaining 1 1/4 cups orange juice into mold to
  partially cover cherries; freeze until firm.
  
  * I'm sure if you don't wish to go through the trouble you can spread
  the lime slices and cherries in liquid and it would just as nice.
  
  To prepare punch, combine juices and sugar in large punch bowl; blend
  well. Just before serving, gently pour in ginger ale; stir gently.
  Unmold ice ring and float, fruit side up in punch bowl.

  add to 2 cups boiling water). I just used my rice cooker and cold
  water and it turned out great. Make cashew milk using 1/2 cup cashews
  blended with 1/2 cup water. Dissolve egg replacer in 2 Tbsp water.
  
  Place all ingredients into large bowl and mix together well. Press
  firmly into nonstick loaf pan and bake at
      350    degree oven for 1 hour.
  
  Place serving plate on top and turn over letting loaf drop out onto
  plate. Serve with mushroom gravy, entered separately.
  
  Helpful Hints:  Makes a great stuffing.  Also can be served as
  "sloppy Joe" covered with marinara
  
  The Holiday Loaf is really delicous, but I would most definately
  consider this a rich, feast day type of food. That is why I only
  serve in on Thanksgiving.

      Title: HOLIDAY TURKEY
 Categories: Turkey
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Turkey
           Margarine; room temperature
           Salt, kosher
           Pepper
      2 lg Onion; quartered
      1    Celery stalk; w/leaves
      2 c  ;Water
           Flour
           ;Water
 
  Cut the celery in large pieces.  Mix some flour and water together
  and make a thick, creamy "kid's paste," then water it down a bit.
  Thaw any size turkey.  Wash it down real good in the sink and don't
  be ashamed of scrubbing her down good.  Make the old girl sing like
  Ethel Merman. My kids lived for this event each year as all my
  turkeys sang in the shower as if their forthcoming debut was at Town
  Hall. This bird you're washing is the star of the show and should be
  treated as such. You'll have more fun watching the turkey bathe if
  you select a noted singer. I've cooked several Ethel Merman turkeys
  and a Kate Smith or two and I remember one Billie Holiday bird.
  
  Slightly dry Ethel with paper towels.  Grab a handful of margarine
  and rub it between your hands.  Now rub the star as if she's getting
  her final massage.  Make sure you get plenty of margarine rubbed into
  the bird. Now, with margarine still on your hands, rub a palmful of
  salt between your hands and apply this to the bird as you did the
  margarine, making sure plenty of salt gets rubbed in. You need not
  worry about too much salt or margarine and a couple of handfuls may
  be required.
  
  Lightly pepper the bird, but don't rub this in.  Dip your hands in the
  creamy paste created from the watered down "kid's paste" of flour and
  water.  Dab this lightly on the skin all over, careful not to go over
  areas already covered with paste.   This is not a crust, but a more
  delicious sealer.
  
  Place turkey in a large roasting pan.  Place quartered onions under
  wings behind drumsticks, in the cavity, and some on the bottom of the
  pan to cook in the broth that you'll need later on. Now place the
  celery along- side the onion and leave the celery tops in the bottom
  of the pan to cook in the broth.
  
  Pour two cups of cool water in the bottom of the pan. DO NOT pour
  over the turkey.  Preheat oven to 350 F. and let the bird cook slow.
  Cover and cook the turkey for at least a couple of hours or until the
  meat turns brown and falls apart at the limbs.  This is a tender
  turkey and will not hold up to carving at the table. Prepare your
  turkey platter on the kitchen cabinet as this bird will fall apart if
  you try and lift it. After the turkey has cooked for at least 1-1/2
  hours, baste the turkey every 30 minutes. Drain off broth and reserve
  to make the stuffing.

      3 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Dry mustard
      8    Drops Tabasco sauce
 
  * Into the top of a double broiler put all ingredients Place about
  one inch of water in the bottom part of the double boiler, and bring
  water to a boil.  Turn the fire down to very low. Place the top part
  of the double boiler into the bottom part.  Add 1 stick (1/2 c) of
  VERY COLD butter to the egg mixture.  Whisk until the butter melts
  and the sauce thickens. Keep the sides and bottom scraped.  If the
  water seems to be boiling too much simply lift the top part of the
  double boiler out of the bottom, and let it calm down.
   When the sauce thickens, put a top on, and try to>>> serve as soon as
  possible.  This never curdles on me.

    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Sugar

  * Into the top of a double broiler put all ingredients Place about
  one inch of water in the bottom part of the double boiler, and bring
  water to a boil.  Turn the fire down to very low. Place the top part
  of the double boiler into the bottom part.  Add 1 stick (1/2 c) of
  VERY COLD butter to the egg mixture.  Whisk until the butter melts
  and the sauce thickens. Keep the sides and bottom scraped.  If the
  water seems to be boiling too much simply lift the top part of the
  double boiler out of the bottom, and let it calm down.
   When the sauce thickens, put a top on, and try to>>> serve as soon as
  possible.  This never curdles on me.

  cauliflower, leeks, or with artichokes as a dipping sauce. Add 2 tbs.
  Dijon mustard with the egg yolks or 1 tbs. freshly snipped dill or
  other herbs for heightened flavor.  If you should end up with a thin,

 Categories: Ethnic, Soups/stews, Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------MM BY HELEN PEAGRAM-------------------------
      4 lb Chicken, cut in pieces
      1    Onion, peeled
      4    Cloves, whole
    1/2 ts Mace
    1/4 ts Pepper
      2    Celery stalks, cut in
           -chunks
      2    Bay leaves
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Rosemary
      4    Sprigs parsley
      2 lg Carrots, cut in chunks
    1/4 lb Vermicelli pasta
           Chopped fresh parsley
 
  In the 1600's when Amsterdam was a booming commercial centre, the
  Dutch East India Company brought pungent spices, such as nutmeg,
  cinnamon and cloves, to Holland. These spices linger on in Dutch
  cooking. If mace is not available, nutmeg can be substituted.
  
  In a large pot, place chicken.  Pour in enough boiling water to cover;
  bring to a boil over high heat. Remove chicken to a clean pot. Stud
  onion with cloves and add to chicken along with bay leaves, 1/2 ts
  salt, thyme, rosemary, mace, pepper, celery, parsley sprigs and
  carrots. Pour in 12 cups cold water.  Bring to a boil over high heat.
  Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered for 5 hours, or until meat
  comes away from the bones. Let cool and skim off fat.  Strain through
  cheesecloth lined sieve. Remove meat from bones, chop and set aside.
  
  Return chicken stock to a clean pot and bring to a boil. Add
  vermicelli. Cook for 5 minutes.  Return chicken and remaining salt to
  pot. Cook just until heated through. Taste and adjust seasonings.
  Garnish with chopped parsley.

  Soak the dried mushrooms in 1 cup water for one hour. Drain the mush-
  rooms, dry, chop finely, and set aside. Strain the soaking liquid
  through a coffee filter. Combine the rice, 2 cups water, and the
  soaking liquid in a large pot and bring to a boil. Add the salt,
  reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is almost
  tender and the liquid absorbed; about 15 minutes.  Remove from the
  heat.
  
  Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium
  heat. Add the onions and the dried mushrooms and saute, stirring,
  until the onions are deeply browned; about 15 minutes. Add to the
  rice and wipe out the skillet.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in the
  same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the fresh mushrooms and
  saute until they are golden brown; about 15 minutes. Add the
  mushrooms and dill to the rice. Season with salt and pepper and mix
  well.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 F. Scald the cabbage leaves in salted boiling
  water for about five minutes.  Drain thoroughly and pat dry with
  paper towels. With a sharp knife, cut out the tough center vein from
  each leaf. Divide the stuffing evenly among the leaves, placing it
  toward the base of each leaf.  Tuck in the sides, and roll the leaves
  up, pressing in the ends firmly as you roll.  In a large oven-proof
  casserole or Dutch oven that can accommodate all the rolls, heat the
  remaining 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Roll the stuffed rolls
  in flour and brown over medium heat on all sides; about 15 minutes.
  Add the stock and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Stir in the remaining
  ingredients. Bake, uncovered, until the cabbage is tender; about 40
  minutes.  Remove the bouquet garni before serving.

      Title: HOMADE PITA BREAD
 Categories: Mcdougall, Breads
      Yield: 25 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
      1 c  Apple juice
  1 1/2 tb Yeast, active dry
    1/2 ts Salt
      5 c  Whole wheat flour
      6 ts Whole-wheat gluten (opt)
           Yellow cornmeal
 
   1. In saucepan, combine water and apple juice and heat just until
  warm (about 115 deg). Put warm liquid in large mixing bowl, sprinkle
  yeast over liquid and allow to dissolve. Add 2 cups flour and the 6
  eeaspoons whole-wheat gluten flour, if desired; beat at medium speed
  of electric mixer for 3 minutes. Cover and let rise in warm place
  until doubled in size, about 20 min.
  
   2. Add salt, beat in as much flour as can be beaten vigorously by
  hand for 6 minutes. Mix as much remaining flour as can be handled
  when mixing by hand and enough so that dough can be removed from bowl
  onto floured surface.  Cover with a towel and let rest for
       10    min.
  
   3. Knead gently and rhythmically for 10-15 minutes.
   Keeping dough rolled in a ball. add the remaining flour, a little at
  a time, kneading after each addition. Be careful not to add too much
  flour, or the bread will be dry. Keep dough slightly sticky to the
  touch. Cover with a towel and let rest 10 minutes.
  
   4. At this point, the dough may be shaped into pita bread. loaves of
  bread, pizza dough, buns, etc.  to make pitas, cut dough in half with
  lightly floured hands, roll each half into rope 2 1/2 inches in
  diameter. Cut each roll into pieces and roll with hands into 2 to 3
  inch balls, depending on the desired size of pocked bread.
  
   5. Place each dough ball on flat surface and with a lightly floured
  rolling pin, roll out from center until dough forms a circle 1/4 inch
  thick.  Gently dip bottom of dough in cornmeal and place on back of
  cookie sheet.  Cover with a towel and let rise at room tempeerature
  for 15 minutes.
  
   6. The best way to bake pitas is on flat quarry tiles, which can be
  purchased at any rock and stone outlet.
   A cast ironskillet turned upside down also works well, but limits
  you to making one pita at a time.  A thrid option, less satisfactory
  than the others but still workable, is a cookie sheet turned upside
  down.
  
   7. Place one of the three items mentioned above in the oven and
  preheat to 500 degrees.  Remove top oven rack for convenience in
  removing pitas later.
  
   8. Gently but quickly slip a raised pita onto a spatula and place it
  on the hot tile, skillet or cookie sheet. Once it touches the hot
  surface, you cannot move it, so aim carefull. Repeat with as many
  pitas as your baking method will accomodate.  Close oven and bake for
  3-4 minutes or until lightly browned. If your baking the pitas on a
  cookie sheet you may see very few or perhaps no bubbles appear - do
  not overcook just because bubbles are small and not uniform. If
  you're using tiles or a cast iron skillet, you will be able to watch
  pockets form immediately.
  
   9. Remove pitas carefully from oven with spatula and place on cooling
  rack. Cut each pita in half while still warm. If difficult to cut.
  Place pita in a damp towel for 5 minutes, and then it will cut nicely.
  
   10.  To store:  Place in plastic bags, 3 or 4 to a bag, while still
  slightly warm to keep soft.  May be frozen.

      Title: HOMARD A LA NORMANDE (LOBSTER~ NORMANDY STYLE
 Categories: Seafood, France
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Fresh lobsters, live
    1/2 c  Sweet butter
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Finely chopped shallots or
           -scallions
     12 c  Calvados
      3 c  Heavy cream
      3 tb All purpose flour
    1/2    Lemon, juice of
      1 ds Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Finely chopped fresh parsley
 
  Servings: 4
  
  Split the lobsters lengthwise with a big knife and break the shells
  off the claws with a hammer or a cleaver. Pour the liquid and the
  tomalley (the liver) into a small bowl. Discard the stomach (the
  small sac which is behind the eyes).
  
  Melt half the butter in a large, heavy saucepan. When the butter
  turns the color of a hazelnut, add the lobsters and sprinkle with
  salt and pepper. Cook over high heat for eight to 10 minutes, turning
  lobsters often. They should turn evenly red all over. Remove the
  lobsters from the saucepan. Arrange in a large roasting pan and place
  in a preheated 250-F oven to keep them warm and to finish cooking.
  
  Add the shallots to the saucepan and sizzle exactly 1 minute without
  burning. Add the Calvados, ignite, and when the flame dies out, add
  the cream. Work together the remaining butter and the flour. When the
  sauce starts boiling, add the flour mixture (beurre manie), bit by
  bit, whipping vigorously into the sauce with a wire whisk until
  smooth. Bring slowly to a boil. Then mix in the tomalley and lemon
  juice. Taste for seasoning and add salt and cayenne pepper, if
  necessary. You may cook a bit longer to reduce the sauce if you like
  it thicker. Stir in the parsley. Pour the sauce over the lobsters and
  serve piping hot.
  
  A rice pilaf is usually served with this dish, and we would recommend
  a chilled white Traminer wine or a bottle of old cider.

      Title: HOME - MADE GINGER BEER
 Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 oz Fresh ginger
      2    Lemons
      1 ts Cream of tartar
      1 lb Sugar
      1 ga Boiling water
      1 oz Yeast
 
  This home-brew remains a favourite party drink in a Welsh household
  for both adults and children.  You will need eight pint bottles or
  four quart bottles. They should be of a strong material and have firm
  caps with metal springs to imprison the effervescent liquid ~ it's
  more explosive than champagne.  Makes 1 gallon. Roughly crush the
  ginger root. Wash and slice the lemons into thick rings. Put the
  ginger, lemon, cream of tartar and sugar in a large bowl. Pour the
  boiling water over. Stir and leave to cool to blood temperature. Stir
  in the yeast. Leave to ferment for 24 hours. Skim off the yeast.
  Strain and bottle the liquid. Leave for three days before broaching
  it.

    1/4 lb Salt pork
      1 ts Mustard, dry
  1 1/2 ts Salt

    1/2 c  Water, boiling
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
 
  Cover beans with cold water and soak over night. Change the water and
  cook at slightly below boiling point until skins burst. To test
  beans, take a few and expose them to cold air; if shells burst, they
  are sufficiently cooked. Drain off the water and add the salt pork
  which has been cut into strips. Put in bean pot, having some of the
  salt pork slices on top. Mix the mustard, sugar, salt, and molasses
  together and add to the beans. Add the boiling water. Cover pot and
  bake at 250-F about 6 hours, removing the cover during the last hour.

      Title: HOME MADE BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Low fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Strong [bread] flour, either
           White or wholemeal
           [wholewheat]
           As preferred
    1/2 pk Instant dried yeast
      1 ts Sugar
        lg Pinch salt
           Warm water to mix
 
  Mix flour, yeast, salt and sugar, then add enough water to make a
  fairly firm dough.  Knead vigorously until dough is smooth and
  elastic - you can do this in a food processor, but it is very
  therapeutic to do it by hand! Place in a clean bowl, cover, and leave
  in a warm place for about an hour, or until doubled in size. Knead
  again, then place on a greased, floured oven-proof plate.  Cover, if
  possible with an oven- proof bowl, and leave for ten-fifteen minutes.
  
  Bake in a hot oven (mark 7, 200 C, 425 F) for about 40 minutes, or
  until it sounds hollow when tapped underneath. This doesn't keep well
  as it has no fat, but that is seldom a problem!

      Title: HOME-CANDIED ANGELICA
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Angelica
      1 lb Granulated sugar
 
  The most important thing about candying angelica is to choose stalks
  that are young and tender.  In other words, angelica is only worth
  candying in April or May when the shoots are new and softly coloured.
  Trim the young shoots into 3-4 inch lengths, put them into a pan,
  cover with water and bring to a boil.  Drain and scrape away tough
  skin and fibrous threads with a potato peeler, rather as you might
  prepare celery. Return the angelica to the pan, pour on fresh boiling
  water and cook until green and tender. If the shoots are as youthful
  as they should be, this will take 5 minutes or less.  Drain the
  stalks and dry them.  Put them into a bowl and sprinkle granulated
  sugar between layers, allowing 1 pound of sugar for every 1 pound of
  angelica. Cover and leave for 2 to 3 days. Slide contents of the bowl
  into a heavy-based pan.  Bring very slowly to the boil and simmer
  until the angelica feels perfectly tender and looks clear. Drain,
  then roll or toss the shoots on greaseproof paper thickly strewn with
  sugar, letting the angelica take up as much sugar as will stick to
  it. Then dry off the angelica - without letting it become hard - in
  the oven, using the lowest possible temperature.  I place the stalks
  directly on the oven shelves (with trays underneath to catch any
  falling sugar) and find they need about 3 hours.  Wrap and store
  after cooling completely. Packed into pretty little boxes,
  home-candied angelica makes a charming present.

 Categories: Mexican, Pork, Main dish, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Jim Vorheis
      4 tb Lard
      3 lb Pork, cut into 2-inch cubes
    1/2 md White onion, roughly sliced
      4    Fresh marjoram sprigs, or
           -scant 1/4 tsp dried
      4    Fresh thyme sprigs, or scant
           -1/4 tsp dried
      3    California bay leaves,
           -broken up
     10    Peppercorns, crushed
      1    Orange, cut into eighths
      1 c  Milk
           Sea salt to taste
 
  Heat the lard in a heavy pan, add the meat, and fry, stirring and
  turning it over from time to time, until lightly golden - about 8
  minutes. Add the onion and stir well. Cook for 8 minutes longer or
  until the meat is well browned (remove onion only if it has burned).
  Add the remaining ingredients, cover the pan, and cook over low heat
  until the meat is just tender, not falling apart - about 20 minutes,
  depending on the quality of the meat.  There should be plenty of pan
  juices. Remove the lid, increase the heat, and fry, stirring and
  scraping the bottom of the pan, until the juices have been absorbed -
  about 10 minutes.  Drain off the extra fat and serve.

      2 tb Olive Oil
      1    Garlic clove finely chopped
     16 oz Can tomato sauce
      1 sm Onion - finely chopped
      2 tb Fresh Parsley - freshly
           Chopped and divided
      1 ts Sugar (optional)
      1 tb Basil, Oregano, or Marjoram
           - finely chopped
           Pepper - freshly ground
           Salt to taste (optional)
 
  When fresh tomatoes aren't in season, here's a quick way to doctor up
  canned tomato sauce. In a Non-Stick VISIONS 1-quart saucepan, heat
  olive oil.  Add onion and garlic and saute over medium heat until
  onion is pale golden. (DON'T BURN IT!) Add tomato sauce and a
  tablespoon of the parsley and cook on medium-low heat about 15
  minutes to blend the flavors. Taste. If too acidic, add a teaspoon of
  sugar. Add freshly ground pepper to taste and salt, if needed. Finish
  by stirring in another tablespoon of parsley and  your choice of
  Basil, Oregano, or Marjoram. This sauce came from the cookbook
  included with the new CORNING Ware VISIONS Non-Stick 1-quart Sauce
  Pan.

  1 1/2 c  Vodka (the cheap-o stuff
           -works just fine)
    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Granulated sugar
 
  Anyone interested in a recipe for home-made vanilla extract? It makes
  a fun gift for Christmas, packaged in a small jar with ribbon around
  neck, included recipe for same, a bag of brownie or cookie mix which
  requires vanilla and a brownie pan.  It IS alcohol-based. Perhaps
  someone has another recipe for one that does not require alcohol?
  Could this be one of those "chemistry" things again?  I apologize for
  typing this in as I still haven't made friends with my software but
  folks who know how to doctor it to adapt to their recipe pgm. will
  find it a tasty and CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP Holiday idea. Better start it
  now, though! It takes about 7 weeks to "steep" it but you can fudge a
  little on that timing, I'm sure.
  
  VANILLA EXTRACT
  
  In a 3 cup glass container with a tight fitting lid, combine vanilla
  beans with the vodka.  Cap and allow to "steep" at room temperature
  for three weeks. Remove vanilla beans and strain liquid through a
  cheesecloth, if necessary.  In a medium saucepan, combine water and
  sugar, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil and sugar
  dissolves. Remove from heat and cool.  Stir into vodka that has been
  strained. Pour mixture into a bottle; cap and allow to sit at room
  temperature one month. Yield:2 cups vanilla extract

           Chunks or logs of fragrant
           Hardwood,
           Preferably a combination of
           Oak & mesquite
  1 1/4 lb Red-ripe jalapeno chiles,
           With stems
    1/2 c  Dried Red New Mexico Chile
           Puree
           OR -
           Commercial chile paste, such
           As Santa Cruz
    1/3 c  Water
      2 tb Tomato paste
      2 tb Cider vinegar
      1 tb Packed dark brown sugar
      1    Clove fresh garlic
           -peeled and crushed
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Prepare a smoker according to the manufacturer's directions, using
  the wood chunks and achieving a steady temperature of 275 to 300
  degrees F. Place the chiles directly on the smoker rack (or use a
  shallow disposable foil pan) at the cooler end of the smoking chamber
  or on the upper rack if your smoker has one. Lower the cover and
  smoke the chiles for 2 1/2 hours, or until they are soft, brown, and
  slightly shriveled.
  
  Remove the chipotles from the smoker. In a medium nonreactive
  saucepan, combine them with the chile puree, water, tomato paste,
  vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, and salt. Set over medium heat and
  bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring once or twice, until the sauce is
  very thick, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
  
  Transfer the chipotles to a covered storage container and refrigerate
  for at least 24 hours before using. They can be refrigerated for up
  to 2 weeks or frozen for up to 2 months.
  
  UNSAUCED DRIED CHIPOTLES:  After removing the chiles from the smoker,
  place them on a rack and leave them, loosely covered, at room
  temperature, until crisp, light, and dry, 1 to 2 weeks, depending on
  the humidity. Store airtight at room temperature.

      Title: HOME-SMOKED SALMON
 Categories: Fish, Signature
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Salmon fillets or steaks
           Alderwood chips
           Chimney Smoker
 
  This is a method rather than a recipe.  The key is to use alderwood, a
  hardwood found in the Pacific Northwest, as the smoking wood. It is my
  understanding that in the PacNW, smokehouses and seafood grills use
  GREEN alder twigs, but such things aren't available on the East Coast.
  
  Ready a chimney smoker (I made one out of a galvanized trashcan
  several years ago, but they are currently cheaper to buy than to
  make!) with a small amount of coals while soaking the alderwood
  chips. When the coals are glowing hot, drain the water from the
  chips, place the chips on the hot coals, get the drip catcher and the
  grate in place, and put the salmon directly on the grate. Close the
  lid and leave it alone for 6 to 12 hours! The fish will cook at 130
  to 140 degrees, and will probably flake when removed from the grate.
  This is of a different flavor and consistency than your normal
  perception of smoked salmon. The fish may be served directly in small
  dishes with a fresh lemon wedge and a quality toast as an appetizer,
  or it can be mixed with a little cream cheese, sour cream, and lemon
  juice as a spread.  Use your imagination!!!

      Title: HOME-STYLE INNER BEAUTY HOT SAUCE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12    Fresh habanero chiles --
           Roughly chopped
      1    Ripe mango -- peel, pit,
           Mash
      1 c  Cheap yellow prepared
           Mustard
    1/4 c  Brown sugar -- packed
    1/4 c  White vinegar
      1 tb Prepared curry powder
      1 tb Ground cumin
      1 tb Chili powder
           Salt and freshly cracked
           Black pepper -- to taste
 
  This style of hot sauce, widely used in the West Indies, is basically
  habanero peppers (also known as Scotch Bonnets), fruit, and yellow
  mustard, with a few other ingredients thrown in. Use this recipe as a
  guideline. Habaneros are at the top of the chile pepper heat scale,
  so feel free to substitute other peppers of your choice.
  
  Funnel the sauce into an old pint liquor bottle, then let your
  imagination run free as to what whopper you can lay on your guests
  regarding its origins. If you're having trouble, here's a start:
  
  "One day in Jamaica I was in this dingy bar and met this old guy
  who..." and you take it from there.
  
  Mix all the ingredients together and stand back.  This will keep,
  covered and refrigerated, until the year
    2018. Be careful, though: If it spills, it will eat a hole in your
  refrigerator. If you ever want to dispose of it, call the local toxic
  waste specialists.
  
  WARNING: Hottest sauce in North America. Use this to enhance dull and
  boring food. Keep away from pets, open flames, unsupervised children,
  and bad advice. This is not a toy. This is serious. Stand up
  straight, sit right, and stop mumbling.
  
  Be careful not to rub your nose, eyes, or mouth while working with
  habaneros.  You may actually want to wear rubber gloves while
  chopping and mixing -- these babies are powerful.

      2 c  Powdered nonfat milk
    3/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 c  (or less) instant chicken(or
           Vegetable if you prefer)
           Boullion
      2 tb Dried onion flakes
      1 ts Basil leaves
      1 ts Thyme leaves
    1/2 ts Pepper
 
  To use in place of canned cream soups in casseroles or as a base for
  your own soups. Much lower in fat and salt than the canned versions.
  The trick is to have it made up ready to use!
  
  Combine all ingredients, mixing well.  Store in an airtight container
  until ready to use.
  
  To sustitute for one can of condensed soup: Combine 1/3 cup of dry
  mix with 1 1/4 cups of cold water in saucepan. Cook and stir until
  thickened. Add to casserole as you would the canned product. Makes
  equivalent of 9 cans of soup.
  
  I think you could probably vary the spices to suit your own taste or
  the type of casserole you were making.
  
  Makes 9 servings with less than 1 gram fat per serving.
  
  Variations:
  
  Mushroom Soup:  Add 1/2 C finely chopped mushrooms Celery Soup: Add
  1/2 C minced celery Potato Soup: Add 1 C diced potatoes, cooked
  Chicken Soup: Add 1/2 C diced chicken, cooked Vegetable Soup: Add 3/4
  C mixed vegetables, cooked Broccoli Soup: Add 1 C chopped broccoli,
  cooked Asparagus Soup: Add 1 C chopped asparagus, cooked
  
  The variations are endless, limited only to your imagination.

 Categories: Desserts, Holidays
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 c  Rolled (not instant) oats
      1 c  Raw wheat germ; (available
           -at natural-food stores)
    1/2 c  Sunflower seeds

      1 c  Dark raisins
 
  Preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Combine all, or as many of these
  ingredients as you can put together, in a huge bowl. You will
  probably have use your hands to turn the mixture over until it is
  thoroughly combined. Divide between 2 jelly-roll pans and toast in
  the preheated oven for 1 hour. Stir the ingredients well every 15
  minutes, turning them over to be sure that nothing burns on the
  bottom. Remove the pans from the oven and allow the mixture to stand
  for about 1 hour until it has cooled completely. Pack into apothecary
  jars, old-fashioned candy jars, or other airtight containers. It
  keeps indefinitely---or at least 8 weeks, which is quite a long time.

      Title: HOMEMADE "LITTLE EARS" ORECCHIETTE CASALINGA
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Semolina flour
      2 c  Unbleached flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Lukewarm water
           -(approximately)
 
  Source: 'The Good Cook - Pasta' Serves: Makes about 1 1/2 pounds fresh
  pasta, or 10-12 oz dried pasta
  
  Combine the semolina, unbleached flour and salt, and mound it on a
  large work surface. Make a well in the center with your finger and
  pour in 3 - 4 Tbls. water. Begin pulling the flour from the inner
  wall of the well into the liquid. Add more water and continue forming
  a paste until the flour has absorbed as much water as possible with
  becoming hard or dry. The perfect consistency is softer than the
  basic flour and egg pasta, but not at all sticky. Knead vigorously on
  a lightly floured board until the dough is smooth and elastic. This
  may take 20 minutes or so. Form the dough into a ball and cover.
  
  To make the 'little ears', pull off a scant handful of the dough
  (keep the rest of the dough covered). On a lightly floured board,
  roll the dough into a rope about 3/4 inch in diameter. Cut the rope
  into slices no more than 1/8 inch thick to form small circles of
  dough. Now put one of these circles into the cupped palm of your hand
  and, with the thumb of the other hand, press and turn the circle at
  the same time to form a dent in the center that will spread the dough
  a little on each side. It should look like a small ear, with slightly
  thicker ear lobes. Repeat with all of the remaining dough, placing
  the orecchiette on a lightly floured cloth as they are made.
  
  The orecchiette are cooked in the same manner as fresh flour and egg
  pasta, although they take longer to cook. Watch them carefully and
  taste frequently for doneness.

      Title: HOMEMADE BAKING POWDER (SINGLE ACTING)
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Measure cream of tarter
      1    Measure baking soda
 
  Mix together and use immediately. If you want to mix ahead of time and
  store no longer than one month, add
        1    measure cornstarch
  
  Note:  I use teaspoons for measure amount, but it really depends on
  how much you need. The cornstarch will help keep the other
  ingredients from absorbing moisture (this is what is used in
  manufactured baking powder). If you have a recipe that calls for
  double acting baking powder, just use twice the amount.
  
  Oh, one more thing, to check and see if the baking powder in your
  pantry is still active, stir 1 teaspoon into one-third cup hot water.
  There should be immediate vigorous bubbling. If no bubbling or
  bubbling is sporadic, the baking powder is past its prime.
  
  Homemade baking powder starts to fizz and release carbon dioxide the
  minute it is added to liquid, it is very important that the oven be
  preheated and baking pans be ready before mixing batter. Mix quickly
  and put in oven right away.

      Title: HOMEMADE CHOCOLATES (LAURA SECORD TYPE)
 Categories: Candies, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Icing Sugar
      1 cn Eagle Brand sweetened
      1 x  Evaporated Milk
      1 x  Butter or Margarine
      1 x  Parafin Wax (Parawax)
      1 x  Semi-sweet Baking Chocolate
      1 x  Food Coloring
      1 x  Artifical Food Flavors
 
  The above ingredients are approximate quantities only!!! For every
  cup of icing sugar you use, mix in approximately 1 teaspoon of
  softened butter or margarine. Then slowly mix in enough of the
  evaporated milk to make the mixture of a consistency such that you
  can form a ball with it. (Mixing with the hands is the easiest way).
  Next seperate the mixture into as many parts (3 or 4) as you want
  different flavored chocolates. Then slowly knead in the desired
  flavoring and food color you want in each different part. Now mold
  the resultant mixture into the desired shapes and sizes you want your
  chocolates to be. Now melt in a double boiler (or microwave) two
  parts semi-sweet chocolate to one part parawax. Remove from heat.
  Immediately, using a tooth pick, pick up each shape created above and
  dip it into the chocolate mixture to coat them. Then put them on a
  piece of wax paper until the chocolate coating is set. As the
  chocolate mixture cools and thickens, reheat it and continue. If you
  run out of chocolate mixture, simply add more chocolate and parawax
  in the proportions listed above.
  
  Note: Suggested flavors and colors:
        - Maple flavor with no coloring
        - Mint flavor with green coloring
        - Lemon flavor with yellow coloring
        - Orange flavor with orange coloring
        - Almond Flavoring with red coloring (small amount to create
  pink)
  
  Variations:
    - With the Maple flavoring, you can bury a piece of pecan or walnut
      inside the candy before dipping it into the chocolate
    - With the almond flavoring, bury a marachino cherry inside the
  candy
      before dipping it in the chocolate. Add a drop of cherry juice
  with it
      to prevent the cherry being too dry.
    - Use the same recipe to make Easter eggs, bunnies etc. Ex. For
  Easter
      eggs, make a center part of one color and flavor and wrap it in
      another color and flavor before dipping.
  
  Note: Parawax must be used with the chocolate to create a consistency
  that
        will stick to your candy and not your fingers when set. It is
  not
        harmful and is used commercially.

  covered airtight container or self-sealing plastic bag for up to 6
  weeks at room temperature. (For longer storage, place in freezer
  container and seal; store in freezer up to 6 months.  To use, allow
  mix to come to room temperature.)
  
  To use mix for corn bread or muffins, lightly spoon into a measuring
  cup; level with a straight-edged spatula. Makes 16 cups of mix.
  
  To bake corn bread or muffins:  Grease or spray an 8x8x2-inch baking
  pan or 10 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with nonstick spray coating. Place 2
  cups Corn Bread Mix in a large mixing bowl. If desired, add 3/4 tsp
  dried basil or thyme, crushed; or dried chives, chili powder, or
  poultry seasoning. Make a well in the center of the dry mixture.
  Combine 1 beaten egg and 3/4 cup water in a small bowl;  add all at
  once to mix. Stir just till batter is smooth (do not overbeat). Pour
  batter into prepared pan or spoon into prepared muffin cups, filling
  each 3/4 full. Bake in a 425 degree over for 20-25 minutes for corn
  bread, and about 15 minutes for muffins or till golden brown and a
  toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Makes 10 servings
  or 10 muffins.

      Title: HOMEMADE CRAB APPLE PECTIN
 Categories: Preserves
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Sliced unpeeled crab apples
      3 c  Water
 
  Simmer, stirring for 30 to 40 minutes, adding water as needed. Plop
  into colander lined with one layer of cheesecloth and set over a
  bowl; press to force the juices. To clear, heat the collected juice
  and pour through a stout jelly bag that has been moistened in hot
  water. The result is the pectin you will use right away, can (1/2"
  headroom, process 185 F for 15 min), or freeze. Refrigerate after
  opening.
  
  Liquid pectin is especially helpful in making peach, pear, strawberry
  or other jellies whose fruit is low in pectin.
  
  4-6 tb of homemade pectin for every 1 cup of prepared juice should
  give a good gel.  For tart apple pectin, start with 4 pounds sliced
  apples with peels & cores and 8 cups of water. Simmer 3 min, press
  through sieve. Return liquid to heavy kettle and cook briskly,
  stirring, until volume is reduced by one-half. Clarify and use as
  above.

    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Pour milk and buttermilk into a large pan and suspend the thermometer
  in the milk.  cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the
  termperature reads 170 degrees.
  
  Keep the mixture on the heat and the temp of the milk between 170 and
  175 degrees.  After 30 minutes, the mixture should start to separate
  into curds (the lumps) and whey (the liquid).
  
  Line a strainer with several lavers of moistened cheesecloth and set
  it inside a large bowl to lift the curds from the milk mixture and
  lay them in the cheesecloth. Pour the remainder of the whey through
  the cheesecloth andsave the whey other recipes.
  
  Let curds drain at room temp for 2-4 hours.  Remove the cheese form
  the cheescloth and place in blender with the salt. Blend until creamy.
  
  Store the cheese in small containers with tight fitting lids and
  refrgerate.  Cheese can also be frozen thawed and then beaten again in
  blender until creamy.

      Title: HOMEMADE FRENCH FRIES
 Categories: Potatoes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Beef fat; cut in
           - small pieces
           Vegetable oil
      1 lb Idaho potatoes
           Salt
 
  Here are the results of Chicago Tribune Test Kitchen experiments to
  make the best homemade French Fries:
  
  1.  To render liquid fat from beef fat, cook it in a heavy saucepan
  over low heat, about 40 minutes or more. Discard pieces of fat which
  are left over.  Add an equal part of vegetable oil to beef fat in pan.
  
  2.  Cut unpeeled potatoes into long strips about  1/4- 3/8-inch wide.
  Soak in a large bowl of ice water for about 45 minutes. Arrange on
  paper towels and carefully pat dry.
  
  3.  Heat oil mixture to 365 degrees.  Add potatoes in batches so pan
  isn't crowded.  Fry until they begin to look partially cooked, about
  5 minutes. Remove and let oil return to 365 degrees. Return partially
  cooked fries and continue cooking until they are crisp and golden, 4
  to 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel to drain. Sprinkle with salt
  and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES FROM THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE TEST KITCHEN:  When we asked where to
  find the best french fries, no one suggested homemade ones, which
  start with fresh potatoes instead of a bag of frozen sticks. Making
  french fries from scratch is a mighty effort, raising the question of
  whether the end justifies the means, so the Tribune test kitchen
  endeavored to find an answer.
  
  With no apologies to nutritionists, we decided to follow the
  conventional wisdom that beef fat is the best way to make
  good-tasting fries and to try using less saturated vegetable oil. We
  got beef fat from the butcher, a big bag of Idaho spuds and a bottle
  of vegetable oil to do some experimenting.
  
  Some basic tenets we accepted as truth: The potatoes would be cut by
  hand with the peels on. They would be
  
  soaked in ice water for 45 minutes. They would be painstakingly
  patted dry. They would be fried twice. The wild cards: What's the
  best oil to use? Is it worth all the effort? Beef fat won hands
  down-no contest. Beef fat fries were crisp and delicate. They were
  not greasy and had a subtle taste. People said it smelled as if we
  were cooking Christmas dinner, which we took to mean they were used
  to standing rib roast for Christmas, not french fries. Those fries
  were gobbled up. On the =============== Reply 26 of Note 1
