      Title: DRY RUB FOR BARBEQUED CHICKEN
 Categories: Rubs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Paprika
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
    1/8 c  Salt
    1/8 c  Garlic powder
    1/8 c  Dried chipotles peppers
           -ground
      1 tb Celery salt
      1 tb Onion powder
      1 tb Pepper, black, fresh ground
      1 tb Chimayo red chile, ground
 
  Mix thoroughly.  To me, the thing that makes this outstanding is the
  chipotles.  And note that these are not the canned ones in adobo -
  they're dried.  This makes their smokiness a bit more intense. You
  might have difficulty finding them.  Look for them in the Hispanic
  section of larger grocery stores. Same with the Red pepper, use
  cayenne instead.

      Title: DRY RUB SPICE MARINADE
 Categories: Herb/spice, Marinades
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Kosher salt
      2 tb Garlic powder
      1 tb Dried thyme
      2 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Granulated or brown sugar
      2 tb Paprika
      2 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  Combine all ingredients, blending thoroughly. If reserving for later
  use, store in a tightly capped jar. To use, sprinkle heavily over all
  sides of meat and rub in well with fingers. Let meat stand at room
  temperature for two hours, or lightly covered overnight in the
  refrigerator. Sprinkle meat again lightly before grilling, broiling
  or baking. This recipe makes enough for 3-4 pounds spareribs. Mixture
  is also good on poultry.
  
  Keeps indefinitely in tightly capped jar. Note from the cook:"The
  secret of a good dry rub is equal proportions of kosher salt and
  sugar. The salt draws juices to the surface of the meat; the sugar
  drinks those juices up, making a lovely, light, potently seasoned
  glaze on the meat.These are the herb bottles closest to my hands, if
  you have other stuff handy, add it as you wish: ground ginger, or dry
  mustard; red pepper flakes, or onion powder. Customize it any way you
  will." Via: RFIX_S 09-28-1994

      Title: DRY SALT CURE FOR A 14-LB HAM
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Ham (English hams weigh
           -roughly 14 to 20 lbs)
      1 oz Brown sugar
    1/2 oz Saltpeter (from the
           -drugstore)
      2 lb Rough salt
 
  The same method may be used for bacon.  A leg of pork severed from the
  whole side is called a ham.  When the leg is left attached to the
  side, and severed only after the cure, it is called a gammon.
  
  You will need a salting pan.  Leave the ham unskinned. Rub in the
  sugar and the saltpeter first, paying particular attention to the
  bone ends. Then rub on half the salt and put the ham to rest on slats
  in a slating trough (best if it has a channel for the brine to drain
  out). Rub in the rest of the salt at the end of a week. Leave the ham
  to take the salt for a total of 3 weeks (depending on the size of the
  ham), turning regularly. Then hang the ham to dry in a draft of warm
  air for a day or two. If you would like to smoke your own, you will
  need a barrel smoker or a smoking shed. Light the fire with kindling
  first, then feed it with beech, birch, or oak sawdust. Smoke over the
  open end of a smoker barrel. Keep the fire smoldering constantly - it
  is not good for the cure to allow changes in temperature.
  
  Twenty-four hours in the smoke shoudl suffice for a ham; 6 hours is
  enough for a side of bacon.  York hams are then hung to mature for 2
  to 3 months in a tgemperature and humidity controlled room.
  
  Time:  3 weeks plus.

      Title: DRY-MARINATING DUCKS
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 tb Coarse (kosher) salt
      1 tb Whole Sichuan peppercorns,
           -roasted and crushed
      2 ts Five-spice powder
 
  Here's the first installment of what has turned into quite a series of
  posts on Chinese Smoke Cooking. I've still got a few more recipes to
  type in, but this on will getcha started...
  
  This is the Chinese version of "smoking".  It would better be called
  "smoke cooking" as the process is much shorter than Western style
  smoking. This first recipe is fairly complex and lengthy in that it
  will take three days or so for all the steps.  It involves dry
  marinating, steaming and the actual smoking of the duck. This recipe
  is from Ken Hom's "Chinese Technique" which is profusely illustrated
  with photos. You'll have to use your imagination a bit...
  
  Salt and five-spice powder make a fragrant dry marinade, which draws
  some of the moisture from the duck so that the spices penetrate the
  bird. The marinated duck is then steamed to firm and cook it, then is
  finished by deep- frying or smoking.  Chicken and squab may also be
  prepared this way.
  
  1.  Press down hard on the duck's breastbone to flatten it.
  
  2.  Rub the dry marinade over the trimmed duck.
  
  3.  Rub the dry marinade inside the cavity.
  
  4.  Put the duck on a baking sheet and cover it with another flat
  sheet.
  
  5.  Weight down the top sheet with a pot filled with water to flatten
  the duck and to make it release some of its own moisture. Let it
  marinate like this, in a cool place or in the refrigerator, for 2
  days. Use the marinated duck to make Smoked Tea Duck, or steam it for
  2 hours to cook and render all the fat.  Let it sit a room
  temperature for several hours to dry then deep-fry in about 4 cups
  oil until crisp.
  
  SMOKED TEA DUCK: This is a cold dish that can be prepared well in
  advance: in fact, we find that ducks smoked 2 days in advance are
  more flavorful. Reduce the steaming time according to the size of the
  bird: allow 15 minutes per pound for chicken, 30 minutes for squab.
  
  The smoking process doesn't actually cook the duck. It adds flavor to
  a duck already cooked by steaming and changes the texture of the
  flesh to something similar to that of ham. A covered barbecue grill
  (such as any of the kettle-type barbecues on the market) is perfect.
  
  1 whole duck, 5 to 6 pounds, trimmed, dry marinated for 2 days 6
  slices fresh ginger root, cut into 3-inch sections 6 whole scallions,
  cut into 3-inch pieces
  
  FOR SMOKING: 1 cup raw long-grain rice 1 cup dark Chinese tea leaves
  1/2 cup brown sugar or hickory chips
  
  Serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer
  
  May be smoked up to 2 days ahead of time and refrigerated until ready
  to serve.  Allow to reach room temperature.
  
  Suggested beverage:  Young, full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon or Barolo
  
  1.  Stuff the cavity of the duck with the ginger and scallions.
  
  2.  Steam the duck for 1 hour 15 minutes (for a 5-pound duck) to 1
  hour 30 minutes (for a 6-pound duck) to draw out the fat and to cook
  the duck gently, keeping it moist. Drain the duck and remove the
  ginger and scallions.
  
  [If you don't have a steamer, you can improvise one by putting an
  upside down bowl or flattish can with both ends removed in a stock
  pot and then putting the duck on a plate on the can. Fill the pot up
  to just below the plate, cover tightly and steam.  S.C.]
  
  3.  Make a bed of charcoal in the barbecue and ignite it. When the
  surface turns to ash, set a metal pie plate containing the smoking
  ingredients on the coals.
  
  4.  Cover it with a grate and set the duck on the grate.
  
  5.  Cover the grill an smoke the duck for 45 to 50 minutes, turn ing
  it every 10 to 15 minutes to brown it evenly. Check the coals
  periodically to make sure they don't die down.
  
  That's it.  I serve this with hot mustard, hoisin sauce and chopped
  green onions for dipping.  And rice of course.

           Info
 
  DRYING SOURDOUGH STARTER:  Use a cookie sheet with a lip.  Place a
  sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie sheet so in effect you have a
  "plastic pan". Pour 1/2 cup of starter evenly over plastic.  It
  should be a thin layer. Place on top of refrigerator for 1-1/2 days.
  Peel pieces of dried starter off of plastic and turn over to continue
  drying other side 1/2 day. Be sure starter is thoroughly dry or it
  will mold or spoil. When starter is dry put pieces in a blender or
  food processor and process until it looks like coarse flour.  Store
  in an airtight container until needed. RECONSTITUTING STARTER: Add
  one cup of water, 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp. sugar to dry starter in a
  plastic or glass container and follow directions for any starter use.
  It takes about 24 hours for starter to activate.

      Title: DUBLIN CODDLE
 Categories: Pork, Irish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Bacon bits (preferably
           -smoked)
      1 lb Meaty sausages (spicy ones
           -if you can find them)
      3 lg Onions
      3 lg Potatoes (or even four)
           Parsley, fresh; handful
           Pepper
 
  Don't omit the parsley, and don't use dried parsley as a substitute.
  It makes a big difference.
  
  "Bacon bits" in Ireland refers to the chopped-up leftovers from
  various other cuts of smoked or cured pork or bacon, usually with the
  pork rind still on. This is wonderful if you can get it. If your
  butcher doesn't carry off-cuts or ends of bacon, ask him for the
  cheapest cut of pork he has that has a good mixture of fat and lean,
  and ask him for some salt pork or fat back as well. Anything smoked
  is preferable. This can be cubed and go into the dish with the rest
  of the pork, to add flavor.
  
  Get good quality pork sausages, flavorful ones, and preferably ones
  without cereal fillers. Spicy sausages work well in this (though they
  wouldn't be terribly traditional:  typically about the only herb or
  spice you find in Irish sausage is a little sage or thyme). Peel the
  onions and potatoes: chop the onions roughly, and chop the potatoes
  into three or four pieces each. Chop the fresh parsley. Layer the
  ingredients in a flameproof casserole with a tight-fitting, heavy
  lid, in this order: onions, sausages, potatoes, bacon, a grind of
  pepper: and so on, until you run out of ingredients. Add 2 cups of
  water to the pot -- no more. Bring the contents of the pot up to a
  boil, without stirring. Then cover the pot, lower the heat to the
  barest simmer --only a bubble or two should come to the surface every
  now and then -- or put it in a low to medium oven, say about 275 F.
  And just leave it there. Come back in anywhere from 3 to 5 hours.
  Recommended to eat with this dish: soda bread, or potato farl (see
  elsewhere for recipes for these), and Guinness. (Draft Guinness is
  now being exported in bottles and cans...) This is friendly, homely
  food: not the kind of thing you offer to guests at a fancy dinner
  party, but good for when you just need something sustaining.
  
  The original meaning of "coddle" was to cook something very slowly
  over a low heat (and this usage is still heard regarding "coddled"
  eggs): only later, and by derivation from this meaning, came the
  sense of the word meaning "to handle something very gently". Dublin
  coddle is a slow-cook dish, famous for being good to have after a
  long night at the pub: it also has a slightly doleful reputation as
  one of the foods served to people after funerals, since it can be
  left unattended for long periods without coming to harm. Various
  Irish literary figures, specifically Jonathan Swift (or Dean Swift as
  the Irish tend to call him) were reported to be very fond of coddle.
  The problem is understanding why, since many coddle recipes are
  incredibly bland. This one is the best version we've been able to
  track down.
  
  By the way, some people believe in offering the pot a nice half-cup
  or so of Guinness itself, before putting the lid on. We haven't tried
  this ourselves, but it sounds sociable.
  
  NOTE:  a "Bottled Draft" Guinness is now available in some parts of
  the States:  it comes in six-packs, the bottles being stumpy rather
  than the usual long-necked shape, and the packing contains an
  injector syringe to produce the proper creamy head on an otherwise
  smooth beer. Despite what come out of the pull-tab cans, Guinness is
  *not* usually fizzy -- it's a side-effect of the canning process.
  (This has led to the odd situation over here of draft and
  bottled/canned Guinness being regarded as two different drinks. Draft
  is for slow, leisurely consumption, for the lubrication of gossip and
  discussion, and for the refreshment of the spirit. Bottled/canned
  Guinness is a thirst-quencher, and not much else.)
  
  Guinness in the keg is also notorious for not travelling well
  anywhere off the island of Ireland, even just across the Irish Sea to
  England. The Port of Liverpool seems to have come to some
  arrangement, but hardly anywhere else. Even the best Irish Pub in the
  States can't do anything about the width of the Atlantic Ocean that
  separates them from Uncle Arthur's brewery in Dublin. These fat
  little bottles are worth looking for; try serving your Guinness in
  the old style, at "cellar temperature" rather than chilled. Put the
  bottles (or cans, if that's all you can find) into a sink full of
  cold water (no ice) rather than your fridge. Leave for an hour.
  Enjoy. Repeat as necessary.

      Title: DUBLIN CODDLE (IRISH)
 Categories: Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Bacon bits (pref. smoked)
      1 lb Good meaty sausages
      3 ea Large onions
      3 ea Potatoes (or even four)
      1 x  Handful fresh parsley
      1 x  Grind fresh pepper
 
  Bacon bits are the off-cuts from the various types of bacon, which
  are sold very cheaply in Dublin pork butchers' shops, specifically
  for making coddle.  They contain a good mixture of fat, lean and
  skin. I prefer to buy regular bacon with the rind on and cut it up
  into even-sized pieces. Leave on the rind, as it adds great richness
  to the soup. Buy the finest quality pork sausages you can afford (or
  find).  Peel and chop the onions roughly. Peel the potatoes as thinly
  as possible. If they are large, then cut them into two or three large
  pieces;  otherwise leave them whole.
   Chop the fresh parsley. -- Place a layer of onions in the bottom of a
  heavy pot with a good close-fitting lid. Layer all the other
  ingredients, giving each layer a grind or so of fresh-ground pepper.
  Add no more than 2 cups of water to the pot.  Bring the water to the
  boil, then reduce the heat at once, cover tightly, and barely simmer
  for 2 to 5 hours. The perfect way to cook it is in a heavy casserole
  pot in a very low oven at 250F.  I know this sounds vague, but if the
  pot is heavy and the lid tight, it really can't come to any harm. The
  longer and slower the cooking, the better.  If you prefer, before
  serving, remove the sausages and quickly brown them on one side under
  the broiler. Serve with white soda farl to mop up the soup, and
  bottles of stout.  It is a most restorative food. -- From THE POOLBEG

  an hour. Meanwhile, cut away the fibrous part of the cabbage, discard
  and cut cabbage into 8 sections. When the beef has been simmering for
  an hour add the cabbage and simmer for another 1/2 hour or until the
  cabbage is very tender. Allow the corned beef and cabbage to cool

           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      1    5 lb domestic duck
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Orange juice
      1 c  Good quality red wine
      1 tb Lemon juice
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
      1 tb Grated lemon or orange rind
    1/2 ts Marjoram
    1/2 ts Rosemary
        pn Oregano
      3 tb Orange curacao
           Flour; for thickening
 
  Cut duck into serving-size pieces; season with salt and pepper. Brown
  in hot olive oil.  Remove to a casserole with tight-fitting lid. In
  same skillet, add orange juice, wine, lemon juice, garlic, onion,
  rind, and seasonings.  Bring to boiling, scraping up browned bits in
  bottom and on sides of pan.  Pour mixture over duck; bake, covered,
  in a 300 degree F. oven for 2 to
        3    hours or until tender.
  
  Remove duck to heated platter.  Strain and measure remaining pan
  juices; taste and correct seasoning. Add orange curacao and enough
  red wine to bring liquid to 2 cups. Thicken to desired consistency
  with flour stirred smooth in a little wine.  Add to measured liquid;
  cook, stirring constantly until thickened. Pour over duck. Serve with
  rice. Source: Favorite Recipes of California Winemakers.
  
  Judi's Notes:  This recipe was modified by me by adding garlic,
  increasing alcohol to 3 tablespoons, and increasing the oven
  temperature to 300 degrees F. to make sure poultry is evenly cooked.
  Original recipe called for an oven temperature of 275 degrees, and I
  felt it needed to be increased.  This is a very tasty dish, enjoy!

      Title: DUCK IN AVOCADO
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Ripe, but firm, avocados
      1 qt Water
           Juice of 1 lemon
           The breast and thigh meat
           -from a whole roasted
           -duckling
      6 md Oranges, peeled and
           -segmented
           Lettuce leaves
    1/4 c  Chopped pecans or toasted
           -sliced almonds
      6 tb Mayonnaise
      2 tb Frozen undiluted orange
           -juice, defrosted
           Parsley sprigs
           Orange wedges (optional)
 
  1.  Peel the avocados, cut them in half, and immediately dip them in
  the water with the lemon juice added to keep them from discoloring.
  
  2.  Be sure the duck meat is skinless and boneless. Cut it into
  bite-sized pieces.
  
  3.  Mix the duck meat with the orange segments. Divide into six
  portions. Fill the avocado halves, which have been placed on a
  platter lined with crisp lettuce leaves, with the portions of meat
  and oranges.
  
  4.  Mix the concentrated juice with the mayonnaise and spoon this
  over each stuffed avocado.  Top each with the nuts. Decorate with
  parsley sprigs and orange wedges.
  
  CHEF'S SECRET:  Always peel the avocado first and then cut it in
  half. This is important, because if avocados are ripe enough to be
  eaten, the halves would be mashed during the peeling process.
  
  If you leave the pits in after halving the avocados and dipping them
  in the lemon water, you can wrap the avocados in plastic wrap and
  keep them all day in the refrigerator. They won't discolor.
  
  You can give this dish an oriental flavor by mixing 1 tbs. soy sauce
  into the 6 tbs. mayonnaise, replacing the orange with canned
  tangerine segments, and grinding some roasted sesame seeds over the
  dish. (The sesame seeds are available in very bandy little plastic
  throw-away grinders in grocery stores carrying oriental foods.)
  
  When using the canned tangerine segments, you can greatly improve the
  taste by pouring off the canned syrup, rinsing the segments quickly
  in cold water, then transferring them to a plastic container. Squeeze
  the juice of 1 lemon over them and, if you like, add 1 or 2 tbs.
  brandy and enough water to cover.  Chill in the refrigerator
  overnight.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

           -diced
      5    Garlic clove; minced
      1    Cinnamon stick
 
  * weight before preparation
  
  Roast the peppers to remove skin; quarter lengthwise and devein.  Set
  aside.
  
  Combine the apricots, plums, three cups of vinegar and water in a
  large non-reactive kettle and simmer until soft; about 25 minutes.
  Remove from heat and set aside.
  
  In another non-reactive kettle, this one very large, combine the
  remaining vinegar, sugars, and Karo and bring to a boil, stirring.
  Add the fruit mixture, ginger, salt, mustard seeds, onion, chiles,
  garlic, cinnamon, and the skinned bell peppers.  Simmer, covered, for
  five minutes then simmer uncovered for one hour, stirring every so
  often. Remove the cinnamon stick.
  
  With a food processor, pulse the mixture for a couple of seconds
  (this has to be done in batches; process a little longer if you like
  a less- textured sauce).  Return to the kettle and boil gently,
  stirring, until the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes (the sauce
  will thicken some more as it cools).
  
  Ladle into sterilized jars, either half-pint or pint.  Process in a
  boiling water bath for 10 minutes (for half-pint jars) or 15 minutes
  (for pint jars).  Allow to age in the jar for 2 to 4 weeks before
  using.

      Title: DUCK WITH CHESTNUTS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lg Duck
    1/2 kg Chestnuts
      2 lg Oranges
 
  This dish, Spanish in origin, is rich in flavour and well worth the
  effort.
  
  Well beforehand, disjoint a large duck by cutting it into 2 breast
  pieces and 4 leg and thigh pieces. Use the back, neck and wings to
  make a good strong stock. Remove the excess fat and render for use
  another day. Parboil and peel 1/2 kg chestnuts.
  
  Heat a large, dry frying pan to very hot and saute the duck pieces
  until golden on all sides. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat
  which will have accumulated in the pan and gently fry a finely
  chopped large onion. When it is golden, add the zest and juice of 2
  large oranges and stir to deglaze the pan.
  
  Put the duck legs into a large saucepan, pour the orange- onion
  mixture over them and add enough duck stock to cover and several
  sprigs of thyme. Simmer for 30 minutes. Then add the duck breasts and
  chestnuts and, if necessary, more stock to cover and cook for 20
  minutes longer or until fork-tender.
  
  Remove the duck and chestnuts to a serving dish and keep warm while
  boiling the sauce hard to reduce until syrupy. Add a tablespoon of
  red currant jelly, adjust the seasoning and pour the sauce over the
  duck and chestnuts. Serve.

           Black pepper to taste
           Fresh coriander, chopped
 
  Prepare the various nuts, the lotus seeds, dried mushrooms, and red
  dates as follows: Soak the peanuts in hot water for 30 minutes; drain
  and set aside. If using dried chestnuts, boil for 20 minutes, drain,
  and set aside. If using fresh ginkgo nuts, remove the shell and
  blanch to remove the thin inner skin; set aside. Soak the Chinese
  mushrooms in hot water for 20 minutes, then drain, remove the stems
  and cut into quarters; set aside. Boil the dried lotus seeds for 20
  minutes; drain and set aside. Soak the red dates in hot water for 30
  minutes. (If they are very dry, boil for 10 minutes.) Drain and set
  aside. Rinse and clean the duck. Rub salt over the duck and rinse
  off; let dry for 10 minutes. Combine the ginger, shallots, and 1
  teaspoon salt. Rub the inside of the duck with the mixture. Combine
  the peanuts, chest- nuts, ginkgo nuts, lotus seeds, and 1 teaspoon
  salt and stuff the duck. Sew the duck closed with heavy white thread,
  or else use skewers. Peel the sugar cane and cut into thin lengthwise
  strips, the same length as the duck. Place 3 pieces of white kitchen
  string on a flat surface, long enough to tie the slices of sugar cane
  around the duck, covering the entire surface. Bring the string around
  and tie as you would a roast. Turn the duck over and slide the
  remaining strips under the string, covering the entire duck with the
  sugar cane. Pour the coconut water into a large pot. Put the duck
  into the pot and add enough water to completely cover. Add the rock
  sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil and remove the scum
  continuously for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down, cover, and keep
  at a lively bubble for 2 hours. Turn the duck every 30 minutes. After
  2 hours, remove the duck from the pot; untie and discard the sugar
  cane. To the liquid remaining in the pot add the mushrooms, red
  dates, 1 teaspoon salt, and the fish sauce. Boil, covered, for 15
  minutes, then remove the duck to the broth, cover, and simmer for an
  additional 15 minutes. Remove the duck and add the scallion pieces to
  the broth. To serve, break the duck, with the bones, into 8 pieces.
  Put the pieces in individual bowls and add broth, some of the various
  nuts that were stuffed into the duck, red dates, and mushrooms.

           Yellow food coloring
 
  Even mature adults - gourmets no less - "oo" and "ah" when presented
  with this simple-to-prepare soup.
  
  Preparation:  Wash & soak mushrooms in warm water for 1 hour; slice
  into thin strips; reserve.  Blanch shrimp in salted boiling water
  (omit if shrimp are precooked).
  
  Make ducklings within hour or less of serving.  Have steamer ready.
  
  Work with eggs & mixing bowl at room temperature. Separate whites &
  yolks; reserve yolks for another recipe. Beat egg whites, starting
  slowly, then progressively faster after eggs begin to foam, until
  eggs are stiff but not runny. If whites are too stiff, they tend to
  break apart in shaping process.
  
  Form 2 ducklings per serving.  Use tablespoon to form body; flatten
  egg in spoon; turn over onto steaming plate. To body, add blob of egg
  for neck & head, another piece for tail. Use toothpick to carefully
  shape head & tail.
  
  Steam one as test. Steaming should take 30-60 seconds to set surface
  of egg. After steaming, swab beak & tail with yellow food coloring;
  put color on toothpick to mark eyes.
  
  Soup:  30 minutes or so before serving, heat broth to just under
  boil; add mushrooms & peas.  5 minutes before serving, add shrimp &
  desired seasonings.  Pour soup into warm serving bowl. Float

      Title: DULCE DE LECHE
 Categories: Deserts, Italian, Puddings
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    Gal milk.
      8 c  Sugar
 
  First boil the milk on medium heat Add the sugar, stirr well and keep
  stirring constantly, so that it doesn't stick on the bottom of the
  pam. The milk will evaporate and the color will change to yellowish.
  
  For a hard dulce de leche, let the milk evaporate till it gets very
  thick in the pan you are cooking.  Then coat a a square pan with
  butter, spread the contents on it & put it in the oven to dry for a
  few minutes.
  
  For a soft dulce de leche, don't let it get too thick while you
  cooking it, then keep in a jar and eat as a spread.
  
  It is really delicious. Sometimes I add peanuts or cinamon for a
  variation. I am from Latin America, and talking about this bring me
  good memories....
  
  Enjoy! It ready when it changes the color from white to yellowish It
  is very very simple.  But you need to keep an eye on the pan. Walt MM

  Dulces (literally sweets) like this one are common all over Latin
  America. They are firm, sliceable pastes made from, for example,
  quinces or sweet potatoes. Serving a slice of semi-soft cheese with a
  similarly- sized slice of dulce is a popular dessert and the flavours
  marry exceptionally well. This mango dulce originated in the
  Caribbean.
  
  Peel remove the flesh and process enough ripe mangoes to provide 2
  cups of mango puree.
  
  Scrape the puree into a saucepan and add 2 cups of white sugar and a
  tablespoon of lime juice.
  
  Cook over a medium heat, stirring all the time until the mixture
  thickens sufficiently so that you can see the bottom of the saucepan
  in the wake of the spoon.
  
  Moisten the inside of a mould++a cake or loaf tin will do++scrape the
  dulce into it and leave to cool.  When it is cold, turn out. It will
  keep very well wrapped in plastic and refrigerated.

      2 tb Sour cream
    100 g  Cooked rice

  Peel, boil and mash potatoes.  Add one egg, salt. Mix, shape into flat
  cakes.  Prepare filling: Wash and slice mushrooms. Fry in oil with
  onions, salt and pepper; add sour cream. Cook over low flame, add
  rice. Place filling in the middle of each patty and seal edges (here
  she means to fold the patty over the filling)-- the dumplings should
  be somewhat elongated when shaped (make an oval, not a round). Dip
  each dumpling in beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs and fry in boiling
  oil (this is deep-frying, I suppose, but I brush them with oil and
  bake on an oiled baking sheet at 350F for 10 or 15 minutes each

        1 lb sausage  -- patties or
  :          links
        1 lb cheddar cheese
  
  Put enough oil in the oven to cover the bottom.  Sear the meat. Add
  the stew seasoning.  Stir in onions. Cook for 20-30 minutes (12 coals
  on bottom and 6 on top) Layer from bottom to top:
  ~------------------------ - potatoes - carrots - celery - green
  peppers - zucchini Cook until vegetables are done (still crispy) (7-8
  coals on top). Add the sausage on top.  Cook approx.  15 minutes. Add
  the cheese. Serve when cheese is melted. This is not a precise
  recipe. I would encourage you to add and delete items and amounts as
  your taste's dictate. Be sure the vegetables, these or the ones you
  may add, are stacked so the ones needing the most cooking time are on
  the lower levels. Don't be tempted to add any liquid as there will be
  plenty from the vegetables and meat. The original recipe called for
  only 1/4 lb of stew meat, but I found that to be inadequate. Give
  yourself plenty of cooking time, but don't be surprise if people want
  to know when it will be done, because the smell is fantastic. This is
  not a creation of mine but is definately a favorite.

  zip lock bag removing as much air as possible. At the camp site,start
  the charcoal allowing about 12 coals for the bottom and 20 for the
  top. Mix the cake mix with 1 cup of cold water and mix until the dry
  mix is moistened. Put the cake batter on the bottom of the dutch
  oven, spreading it level over the bottom. Shake the fudge topping
  materials over the top of the batter, and carefully pour the hot
  water over thetopping to wet it all. Put the lid on the dutch oven
  and bake for 45 minutes. The cake rises ! ! to the top and the fudge
  sauce to the bottom as it bakes. Watch the bottom heat to avoid

  "My mother used to make this Dutch almond-filled spice cake for
  special occasions and always at Christmas time. When my grandmother,
  Oma, would visit us from Holland, she would expect it with her
  coffee. Once, when i went to Holland, for a visit, my aunt served me
  some, but it just didn't taste as good as the one at Oma's house. I
  was told my aunt's cake was store bought. My mother passed Oma's
  recipe on to me, and now i carry on the tradition."

  rind. Set aside. CAKE: In a bowl, sift together flour, cinnamon,

      Title: DWIGHT'S BRISKET
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           SEE DIRECTIONS:
 
  Everyone has their own way of doing things, this the way I do it.
  First of all you must know up front I am a LazyQ kind of guy, who
  wants consistency without a lot of effort. Brisket is my favorite of
  all Q. I usually buy a 10# brisket packer or untrimmed [lot of fat],
  the trimmed do not have the flavor as the fat boys. Unwrap the
  brisket, wash it and while it is still wet apply a rub : 2 oz. of
  each of the following ingredients : salt,black pepper paprika, garlic
  powder, accent , chili powder. Add 1/2 oz. red pepper. Mix these up
  and you will have a powder rub. If you are a spicy kind of guy apply
  the rub thick.  If you a bland mellow guy like me, then apply
  lightly. After the rub is on, it will stick like glue due to the meat
  being wet, put brown sugar on as thick as possible. Place the brisket
  on the smoker, fat side up, hold about 200 or so degrees. Smoking
  time depends on the unit you have the wood you are using and so on,
  but a good rule of thumb is 6 hours.  Once the meat is a dark color,
  cut into it to see if it has a ring like the brisket you buy in a
  restraunt, about 1/4" thick. At this point you have all the smoke you
  need but the brisket is far from done. Take it off the smoker, put it
  in the fridge, freezer, or go on to the next step. About 6 to 8 hours
  prior to serving place the brisket in a deep pan, add about 1/3 cup
  of water, seal the pan with a lid or tinfoil, place in the oven on
  the top rack, set the temperature at 190 - 210. Within about 5 or 6
  hours the house will be consumed by this mouth watering aroma,
  driving the inhabitants into a frenzy. The weaker ones will go mad,
  so make sure your family is mentally stable with some degree of will
  power to wait on a good thing. If the meat is not tender to the point
  of almost cutting it with a fork, it did not cook long enough. Prior
  to serving trim off the fat, and you are now the genius that everyone
  will give advice on how to start a BBQ restraunt. Oh, by the way,
  expect up to a 40% shrinkage, a 10# brisket raw might be a 6# cooked.

      Title: DYRESTEG (ROAST VENISON W/GOAT CHEESE SAUCE)
 Categories: Norwegian, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Boneless haunch of venison
           -or reindeer
      3 tb Butter; softened
           Salt & pepper
  1 1/3 c  Beef stock
      1 tb Butter
      1 tb Flour
      2 ts Red currant jelly
    1/2 oz Brown Norwegian goat cheese;
           -(Gjetst), finely diced
    1/2 c  Sour cream
 
  Preheat oven to 475F. Tie the roaast up neatly at 1/2" intervals with
  kitchen cord so that it will hold it's shape while cooking. With a
  pastry brush, spread the softened butter evenly over the meat. Place
  the roast on a rack in a shallow open roasting pan and sear it in the
  hot oven for about 20 minutes. When the surface of the meat is quite
  brown, reduce the heat to 375F and sprinkle the roast generously
  with salt and pepper. Pour the stock into the pan and cook the roast,
  uncovered, for 1 1/4 hours. With a large spoon or bulb baster, baste
  the meat with the pan juices every half hour or so. The interior
  meat, when finished, should be slightly rare, or about 150F on a
  meat thermometer. Remove the roast to a heated platter, cover it
  loosely and let rest in the turned off oven while you make the sauce.
  Skim and discard the fat from the pan juices. Measure the remaining
  liquid and either reduce to 1 cup by boiling it rapidly or add enough
  water to make up 1 cup. In a small, heavy saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon
  of butter and stir in 1 tablespoon of flour. Stirring continuously
  with a wooden spoon, cook this roux for 6 to 8 minutes over low heat
  until it is a nut brown color. Be careful not to let it burn or it
  will give the sauce a bitter flavor. Now, with a wire whisk, beat the
  pan juices into the roux. Next whisk in the jelly and cheese. Beat
  until they dissolve and the sauce is absolutely smooth, then stir in
  the sour cream. Do not allow the sauce to boil. Taste for seasoning,
  remove the strings from the roast and carve the meat in thin slices.
  Pass the sauce separately.

    1/2 c  Soft butter;
      2    Eggs;
      1 c  Milk;

      1 tb Flour;

MMMMM-------------------------EQUIPMENT------------------------------
           Measuring cups
           Medium mixing bowl
           Measuring spoons
           Mixing spoon
           Chopper or paring knife
           8-in.-square cake pan
 
  How to Make:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Cruch the graham
  crackers with hands until you have 1 3/4 cups coarse crumbs about the
  size of bread crumbs. Put the cracker crumbs into the mixing bowl
  with the flour, baking, and sugar.  Stir with the spoon until they
  are combined. Chop the almonds and walnuts into small pieces. Add the
  soft butter, eggs, milk, vanilla and chopped nuts to the dry
  ingredients. Stir the mixture well. Then beat the batter until it is
  well blended. Grease the cake pan with the butter. Sprinkle with the
  tablespoon of flour and shake the pan until bottom is evenly coated.
  Shake out an extra flour. Bake the cake for 45 minutes. Test with a
  toothpick for doneness. Remove the from the oven let it cool
  slightly. Cut it into squares and serve warm.
  
  Topping:  You might want to sprinkle powdered sugar or spread whipped
  cream on top.
  
  STORY:  Thanks to Dr. Sylvester Graham, you can bake this crunchy
  cake from crackers named after him. Graham, who lived in the early
  1800's insisted that whole wheat flour was far more healthy then
  white flour. In those days, it was.  Whole wheat flour was made by
  grinding the whole grain of wheat.  For white flour, only the soft
  inside of the grain was used. The outer layers, rich with vitamins
  and minerals, were left out. Today, white flour is "enriched" with
  the need vitamins and minerals. But whole wheat is still naturally
  healthy. So are the graham crackers, made from this flour. Use them
  for this one-bowl cake. It's all American.

      Title: EARLY-BIRD BUTTERMILK PANCAKES
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
  2 1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Buttermilk
    2/3 c  Milk
      1    Egg; beaten
      2 tb Cooking oil
           Oil for pan
    1/2 c  Milk; as needed for thinning
 
  SIFT TOGETHER THE FLOUR, sugar, salt and baking powder. Beat together
  the buttermilk, milk, beaten egg and oil. Pour the liquid into the dry
  ingredients and stir until well mixed. A few small lumps in the
  mixture will cook out. The first pancake is a test pancake. The
  batter should be thin for pancakes, so thin the batter if necessary
  with milk (not buttermilk). The pan should be lightly oiled and hot
  enough to make a sprinkling of water dance, not just sit and sizzle.
  Ladle about 1/8 cup of the batter into the hot pan. When the top of
  the pancake is full of bubbles and the bottom is golden, turn the
  pancake. Cook on the second side until done.

  hotter chiles or adding to spice quantities. Pound chiles and garlic
  in a mortar (or process). Add to melted butter (in Africa, usually
  clarified butler) with paprika and chile powder. Add lime or lemon
  juice to taste (lime will be better for this one). Mix well. For

  Beth's Note: Amarillo is a town of about 175,000 people in the middle
  of the panhandle of Texas. Visitors expect great steaks, ranch style
  barbecue and red-hot Tex-Mex cooking along the Texas stretch of
  Interstates 40 and 27. But Amanllo restaurants offer other treasures
  as well, thanks to the influence of newer Texans from Indochina and
  Asia. Cafes with names such as the Thai Star, My Thai, Peking and
  Hunan have taught Texans that jalapenos are not the only way to turn
  on your taste buds. --Food Editor, Amarillo Globe-News, Amarillo

 Categories: Indian, Beans, Chili
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    1/4 c  Large dried lima beans
    1/2 tb Light vegetable oil
    1/4 ts Cumin seeds
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      2    Garlic cloves, peeled,
           -crushed
      1    Half-inch piece fresh
           -ginger, peeled
    1/2 c  Peeled, chopped tomato
      2 tb Flaked coconut
      2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
  2 1/2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
      1 tb Chopped fresh dill
 
  Dalnas are the ingenious creations of cooks from Orissa, in eastern
  India. Traditionally, the dish is prepared with yellow mung beans,
  but I have created this recipe using readily obtainable large lima
  beans. To round out the menu, accompany this robust stew with rice
  pilaf.
  
  Rinse lima beans. Soak in water to cover for 6 hours, or overnight.
  Drain and rinse again. Set aside.
  
  Heat oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add cumin,
  onion, garlic and ginger. Stir and cook until onion starts to brown,
  about 4 minutes. Add tomato, coconut and cilantro, reduce heat and
  cook until tomato is soft. Transfer to a blender, add 1/4 cup of the
  water and blend until smooth. (If necessary, add more water to
  facilitate blending.)
  
  Combine beans, tomato-onion mixture and remaining water in a heavy 2
  quart saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, cover, and
  cook until beans are tender, but still hold their shape, about 1
  hour. Add cayenne, paprika and salt. Mix thoroughly. Garnish with
  fresh dill.

  1 1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar mixed
           -WITH
    1/4 c  Lemon juice AND
      1 ts Water, for glaze
 
  In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, scald milk. Add butter and
  stir until melted. Remove pan from heat and let mixture cool to
  lukewarm.  In a small bowl, stir yeast into warm water; let sit for 5
  to 10 minutes, or until foamy.  In a large bowl, beat eggs, yolks,
  and sugar until thick. Add salt, zests, vanilla, and liqueur. Stir to
  combine. Stir in milk mixture, then yeast.  Add flour, a cupful at a
  time, until dough is moist but not sticky, mixing with a wooden spoon
  or your hands. Stir in almonds and raisins.  Knead dough on a floured
  board, adding more flour if dough is too sticky, until dough comes
  away from your hands, about 6 minutes. Place dough in a very large
  buttered bowl.  Cover dough with a damp cloth and let rise until
  doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down and let rise again until doubled,
  45 minutes to 1 hour.  Heat oven to 350'. Butter three 9-or 10-inch
  kugelhopf or angel-food-cake pans. Sprinkle pans with a tablespoon of
  confec- tioners' sugar, if desired. Divide dough into 3 portions and
  form into balls; arrange in pans and cover loosely. Let dough rise to
  tops of pans, about 30 minutes.  Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until
  cakes are golden brown and tops make a hollow sound when tapped with
  knuckles. Cool for 5 minutes in pans; turn out onto racks and cool
  for 20 minutes more. Spoon glaze onto babka, allowing it to drip over
  sides.

 Categories: Holidays, Candies, Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Chocolate coating
      1 lb White coating Or any color
      1    Taffy molds
      1    Sticks
      1    Taffy covers
 
  You can also buy your molds and sticks, and sleeves of plastic to put
  over the taffy at a candy supply store. Melt the coatings. I use a
  electric fry pan with water on low and use small stainless steel or
  glass bowls to melt different color coatings and of course the
  chocolate. Just fill the molds, put in stick and roll it to coat it
  and set it in the coating. I place in the frezzer for a minute or two
  to make them nice and shiny.

  Dip the pretzils in and lift with a fork, shaking off excest coating.

      Title: EASTER LAMB
 Categories: Italian, Meats, Mrs. g, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           - G. Granaroli XBRG76A
           - MM:MK VMXV03A
      1    Bulb of fresh fennel (anise)
      4 tb Chopped garlic or more
           -if you like
           Salt and plenty of fresh
           -ground pepper
 
   Get a leg of lamb and ask the butcher to bone it and butterfly it
  for you. Do not let him tie it in a roast but ask him for some
  butcher string so you can do it by yourself. When you get the lamb
  home, try to remove as much fat from the inside as possible if the
  butcher didn`t clean it well. Now you are going to make your own
  roast of boneless lamb.
  
  To begin...Lay the meat out flat on a large clean surface skin side
  down. Cut off the fuzzy top of the fennel and wash thoroughly. cut
  into 4" stalks using everything (save the bulb) Cover the meat first
  with salt and pepper. Spread the garlic all over the meat. Lay the
  pieces of fennel next spread over the meat. Now roll up like a
  jellyroll and start tying with the string about 2 " apart. Get it as
  tight as you can. Then tie it lengthwise tucking the ends in. Place
  in a roasting pan and lightly oil top and sides. Salt an pepper the
  roast. Cut the fennel bulb into chunks and drizzle with about 2 tbls
  of melted butter or oli. Bake at 350 for about 1 hour covered. Turn
  every 1/2 hour. Remove cover and continue to bake 1 hour uncovered.
  Before the last 1/2 hour add 1/2 cup white wine. When done, remove
  the meat to a warm platter. Do not cut too early, lamb gets cold
  fast. Put the roasting pan on top of the stove and make a gravy with
  the drippings. Add flour and water. You may even use a bit more wine
  or broth, adjust for salt, strain and serve on the side for the meat
  or mashed potatoes.

      Title: EASTER MINTS KIDS CAN MAKE
 Categories: Candies, Children, Cyberealm, Kook-net
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Soft butter
    1/3 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Flavoring
  3 1/2 c  ( 1 lb ) sifted
           -confectioner sugar
           Large bowl
           Wooden spoon
           Paper plates
           Pencils
 
  This is a no-cook recipe the children can mix with their hands.
  Flavor it with any of the liquid flavorings in the supermarket, such
  as strawberry and lemon. If you want, you can instead divide it into
  three portions and add a few drops of food coloring to tint it
  yellow, red, and green. The knead a small amount of flavoring into
  each one. This recipe makes about 1 1/2 lbs of candy. Help the
  children measure all the ingredients into the large bowl. They can
  take turns stirring it with the wooden spoon until it becomes too
  stiff. Then they can knead it with their hands. They should continue
  kneading until the dough is smooth. Give each child a paper plate and
  a pencil. Tell them to turn their plates OVER and write their names
  on the Bottom to prevent pencil lead from getting on their mints.
  Help them hold their pencils correctly. Make sure they use upper and
  lower case letters. Give each child a portion of dough on his or her
  plate. The children can pinch off pieces, roll them into balls, and
  press them lightly with a fork to make a fancy butter mint. Children
  who cannot roll the candy into balls can make snakes, cut the snakes
  into pieces, and press the pieces with a fork. They might eat the
  pieces with the fork, but that's ok too. Leave the mints on the
  plates and refrigerate them for 30 minutes, until they become firm.
  Easter Mints taste even better the second day, if you can keep
  everyone from eating them all on the first day.

      1 lb Coconut;shredded
      1 lb White chocolate;OR
      1 lb Green coating
      1 lb Small Jelly Beans
 
  Melt your coating mix. If you have white chocolate just add a drop or
  two of green coloring(do not use the liquid kind) so that it is a
  light green. I Melt mine in a stainless steel bowl in a pan of water,
  I use my old large electric fry pan if I am melting a lot of
  different colors. You can also melt them in wide mouth jars, and keep
  what you don't use. In bowl of melted coating mis in the coconut.
  Spoon out on was paper, put a indentation in middle to look like a
  nest, and add the small jelly beans. I also put in the freezer for a
  few minutes to set real good. Enjoy Joni in S.Jersey ~--

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------PHILLY.INQUIRER---------------------------

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE CRUST----------------------------
    3/4 lb Crisco
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      5    Egg yolks
      2 tb Or 3 of sugar

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
      3 lb Ricotta
      7    Whole eggs
      5    Extra whites
    1/2 c  Sugar or more
      1    Grated rind of 1 or more
           Lemons
      1 tb Vanilla
      2 tb Liqueur
 
  Crust:  Mix Crisco shortening with flour, cutting it in with pastry
  blender or two knives until you get beads like small peass. Mix in
  the egg yolks and sugar. Knead a little bit to get it to hang
  together. Add more flour if you have to. Don't play with it! Put in
  the refrigerator while you do the rest. FILLING: A lot depends on the
  ricotta here. Supermarket ricotta must be drained of whey. Italian
  cheese stores and delis throughout the city (Philly) especially at
  this season, sell handmade ricotta, which makes a denser and creamier
  cake. It coasts about $2.00 more for 3 lbs. "I use Tia Maria, Grand
  Marnier, Amaretto, whatever liqueur I feel like depending on my many
  moods", says Nanny Giordano. Beat up the eggs good with sugar,mix in
  lemon, vanilla and liqueur, then mix with cheese." Beat it up nice,
  don't go" Johanna flings her hands around aimlessly." GET IT Smooth".
  Use a deep ovenproof glass.I used a 2" deep,13" oval dish from
  France,Arcuisine d'Arcopal. Nanny doesn't bother, but I rubbed the
  surface with a little shortening to prevent sticking. Take dough from
  refrigerator. "Can you roll it out? Yes but don't bother "Take pieces
  in your hands and plaster the inside of the dish, more or less
  lumpily smooth. Pour in filling. Bake in a slow oven, at 325 deg.
  "until it's done. About 1 hour. It'll set and puff. You'll see. "I
  made this recipe. I saw. It works.You may have more or less chese
  left over,depending on your baking dish and your ricotta.But it will
  work... This is the recipe of Johanna Guarracino as told to Jim Quinn
  of the Inqir.

      Title: EASY BAKED TEMPEH
 Categories: None
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Tempeh
     16 oz Tomato sauce, Mcdougall
    1/4 c  Onion; chopped fine
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
    1/4 c  Soy sauce, low sodium
    1/2 ts Curry powder
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
 
  Preparation Time: 0:50 Tempeh is a compact patty made by fermenting
  cooked hulled soybeans with a beneficial mold that binds the beans
  together. Other legumes, such as peas and lentils, and also grains,
  such as rice, wheat, and barley -- alone or in various combinations
  ~- are sometimes added. Because it has a dense, solid consistency, it
  is often used to replace meat in various dishes and on sandwiches.
  Like tofu, it is high in fat and protein. You will find tempeh in the
  refrigerated or frozen food sections of your natural food store.
  Refrigerated, it lasts a week, and frozen, it lasts indefinately.
  Freezing does not change its texture appreciably.
  
  Cut the tempeh into bite-sized pieces and set aside. Preheat the oven
  to 350 degrees. Combine the remaining ingredients in a small saucepan
  and simmer over low heat until the sauce thickens slightly, about 10
  minutes. Spoon a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a 2 - quart
  baking dish. Add the tempeh pieces and cover with the remaining
  sauce. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 lb Boneless pork roast
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 md Onion, minced
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Bottle of your favorite bbq
           -sauce
 
  Place the roast, garlic, and onion in a crock pot on high. Add the
  salt and pepper and a little bit of water. Cook on high until you can
  easily shred the pork roast with a fork. I would cook this in my
  crock pot (Rival) for about 5 hours. Remove the roast and shred the
  meat removing as much of the fat as possible and the bone. Strain the
  grease in the crock pot, keeping any bits of garlic and onion left
  and throwing out the grease. Place the shredded meat back into the
  crock pot, along with the bits of garlic and onion. Pour the BBQ
  sauce over all until the meat is covered. Mix well. Continue cooking
  the pork in the crock pot for about three hours, on low. Serve the
  BBQ pork on Kaiser rolls, onion rolls, pocketbook buns or any
  speciality hamburger bun. Very Good.

      1    Bay leaf
      2 tb Flour
 
  My old Sunset "Favorite Recipes" cookbook has a "Beef Burgundy" recipe
  which I've made for years. Over time, I've adapted the recipe to take
  advantage of a few shortcuts without sacrificing the great flavor. The
  following is my version:
  
  In a Dutch oven or heavy saucepan cook the onion and bacon until
  onion is soft, but not browned. With a slotted spoon, remove onion
  and bacon and set aside. Add the round steak to the pan drippings and
  cook until browned on all sides. Sprinkle the meat with salt and
  pepper, then add the mushrooms, garlic, wine, water, parsley, celery,
  thyme, and bay leaf. Return the onion and bacon to the pan and stir
  well, then cover and cook over low heat for 1-1/2 hours, or until
  meat is tender. Keep an eye on the liquid in the pan and add water
  and reduce heat if it seems to be boiling away quickly. When tender,
  with a slotted spoon, remove meat mixture from the liquid to a
  serving bowl. Discard the bay leaf. In a cup, mix some of the hot
  liquid with the flour, then stir into the liquid remaining in the
  pan. Cook stirring constantly until thickened (should only take about
  1 minute). Pour the thickened liquid over the meat mixture in the
  serving bowl, stir to mix, and serve immediately over rice.

      Title: EASY BRIOCHE LOAF
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
      1/2 c  milk
        1    envelope (2 teaspoons)
  :          active dry yeast
    2 1/4 c  unbleached, all-purpose
  :          flour, -- divided
        6 TB unsalted butter
        3 TB sugar
      1/2 ts salt
        2 lg eggs
  
  Butter a loaf pan and cut a piece of parchment or wax paper to fit the
  inside bottom of the pan. Butter the paper. About 40 to 45 minutes
  after placing the dough in the pan to rise, preheat the oven to 350
  degrees, setting a rack in the middle level.
  
  In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the milk until it is just
  warm, about 110 degrees. Remove from heat and pour into a small bowl.
  Whisk in the yeast, then stir 1 cup of the flour into the yeast and
  milk mixture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside at room
  temperature while preparing other ingredients. It may begin to rise
  slightly before you add it to the other ingredients.
  
  Cut the butter into 6 or 8 pieces and combine with sugar and salt in
  the work bowl of a food processor, fitted with the metal blade. Pulse
  at one-second intervals until the mixture is soft and smooth,
  scraping the inside of the bowl several times to ensure even mixing.
  Add the eggs, one at a time, and process until smooth. If the mixture
  appears curdled, continue to process for about 1 minute longer, until
  it looks smoother. (It may remain somewhat curdled in appearance.)
  Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour, then the milk-yeast-flour
  mixture, scraping it from the bowl with a rubber spatula. Pulse at
  one-second intervals until the ingredients form a soft, smooth dough.
  Then process continuously for fifteen seconds.
  
  Remove work bowl from base and remove blade. Scrape dough onto a
  generously floured work surface and fold it over on itself several
  times to make it more elastic. Press the dough into a rough
  rectangle, about 9 by 5 inches. Fold each side about 1 inch in toward
  the center and press firmly to seal. Then starting at the top of the
  rectangle, fold the dough to the middle. Fold the bottom of the dough
  up past the seam and pinch to seal. Place the dough in the prepared
  pan, seam side down. Press the top of the dough firmly with the palm
  of your hand to flatten it and fill the pan evenly. Cover with a
  piece of buttered plastic wrap or a towel and allow to rise until it
  is about one inch above the rim of the pan.
  
  Using the corner of a razor blade or the tip of a sharp knife held at
  a 30 degree angle to the top of the loaf, cut a slash down the middle
  of the top beginning and ending about one inch from the ends of the
  loaf.
  
  Bake the loaf for about 40 minutes, until it is well risen and a deep
  golden color. Place the pan on a rack to cool 5 minutes. Then invert
  the loaf to the rack and turn it on its side to cool
  
  Variation: Cinnamon Raisin Brioche Loaf
  
  In step 4, sprinkle dough with cinnamon and about 1/2 cup raisins,
  then roll up and place in pan.

      Title: EASY BRISKET
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           SEE DIRECTIONS:
 
  I love brisket but always need to simplify my cooking. I am enclosing
  the easiest brisket recipe I have ever found that is great! It also
  reheats very well in the microwave covered with lid or saran wrap.
  This will be our Easter dinner.
  
  Day before cooking: Marinate the brisket in 1 bottle of Liquid Smoke,
  after salting with onion salt, garlic salt, and celery salt.
  
  Day of serving: Heat oven to 250 degrees. Pour one bottle of your
  favorite barbeque sauce over the brisket, cover, and cook for 2-3
  hours, depending on size. When done, let sit one hour before serving.
  
  It doesn't get much easier than this but the taste is divine and only
  one pan is dirty.  Great served with lots of vegetables.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  Mix 2C flour with 1 t salt  (I use 1/2 whole wheat flour and adjust
  water)
  
  Scald 1/2 C milk.  Add in 1 1/2 C boiling water and let cool to
  lukewarm.
  
  Dissolve 1 package yeast in 1/4 C lukewarm water.
  
  Add the dissolved yeast to the milk/water and add to the dry
  ingredients, along with 1 T sugar and 1 1/2 T oil.
  
  Mix well but don't knead.
  
  Cover and let rise until almost doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch down.  Form into two sort of flat shapes.  Roll each (sort of
  jellyroll like) into two loaves. They'll be a little longer and
  thinner than average bread. Cover and let rise again until almost
  doubled in bulk, or until a finger indentation doesn't disappear
  after a few minutes.
  
  Place on oiled cookie sheet.  Place a pie pan with 1/2 " of boiling
  water on the bottom of the oven.
  
  Bake 15 minutes at 400 and 30 minutes at 350.

  instead.

      Title: EASY CHEESE & SHRIMP GYOZAS (EAST/WEST)
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Cheese/eggs, Oriental
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Medium shrimp (41 to 40 per

  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Finely minced ginger or

      1 ts Cornstarch
      5    Fresh water chestnuts,
           -finely chopped
      2    Green onions, chopped
  1 1/2 tb Chopped fresh coriander
      2    Chinese sausages, finely
           -chopped
  1 1/4 c  Grated Monterey Jack cheese
           -(about 5 ounces)
      1 pk Round siu mai wrappers or
           -won ton wrappers
           LIME CREAM SAUCE
           (see note)
      1 tb Oil
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Lime juice
 
  Salt and white pepper to taste Sprigs of fresh coriander
  
  Toss the shrimp with 1 teaspoon of the salt and let stand for 10
  minutes. Rinse thoroughly, drain and pat dry.
  
  Finely chop shrimp and put them in a mixing bowl.
  
  Add remaining salt, ginger, rice wine, cornstarch, water chestnuts,
  green onions, coriander, sausage and cheese to mix- ture; mix
  thoroughly.
  
  If you are using won ton wrappers, trim the corner to make a circle.
  
  Place 1 heaping teaspoon filling in the center of 1 wrapper. Moisten
  the edge of the wrapper with water and fold in half to enclose
  filling and form a half-circle. Pinch the edges together to seal.
  
  Set on a baking sheet; cover with a towel. Repeat with remaining
  filling and wrappers.
  
  To cook and sauce 4 servings, add 1 tablespoon of the oil to a 10-inch
  nonstick skillet and set over medium heat.
  
  Arrange 12 gyozas in one single layer; pan-fry for 1 minute or until
  lightly browned. Turn the gyozas over to brown other side, about 1
  minute longer.
  
  Add chicken stock, shake pan to prevent gyozas from stick- ing. Cover
  and cook at low boil for 2 minutes. Remove gyozas to a plate; keep
  warm.
  
  Increase heat under skillet to high, add cream; bring to a boil
  stirring for 45 seconds until thickened. Stir in lime juice.
  
  Season with salt and pepper.
  
  To serve, divide the sauce among 4 plates. Arrange 3 gyozas on each.
  Garnish with fresh coriander springs.
  
  Note: There is enough filling to make 4 dozen gyozas. The amount of
  sauce indicated above is enough for 12 gyozas. If you want to make
  more, multiple the sauce ingredients, but bear in mind that you will
  have to make the sauce separately as part of each batch. Freeze extra
  uncooked gyozas on a baking sheet; when frozen, transfer them to a
  freezer bag. Do not defrost before browning.
  
  Makes 4 dozen gyozas. Serves 16.

MMMMM----------------------LIME CREAM SAUCE---------------------------
      1 tb Oil
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb Lime juice
           Salt and white pepper, to
           -taste
           Fresh coriander
 
  I find Chinese recipes that use dairy products highly suspect and
  tend to turn my nose up at them.  Ooopsss. Guess I *am* a snob. ;-}
  But I just bought an excellent new cookbook++Asian Appetizers by
  Joyce Jue, a local (SF local, that is) food columnist.  Check this
  one out... You should be able to get all the ingredients easily,
  including the Chinese sausages.
  
  Cheese and cream are not traditional ingredients in Asian cooking.
  However, I enjoy the subtle flavor of a mild cheese, such as Monterey
  Jack, and the way it works in this gyoza (Japanese-style potsticker)
  recipe. The cheese acts as a velvety binder that melts in your mouth;
  the cream is used to make a lime-scented sauce.
  
  A dozen gyozas makes a nice appetizer serving for four, but it's not
  really practical to make just a dozen at a time. This recipe makes 4
  dozen, and the rest can be frozen for another use. The sauce recipe
  is enough for a dozen; if you want to make more, simply multiply the
  sauce ingredients, but bear in mind that you will have to make the
  sauce separately as part of each batch.  Freeze extra uncooked gyozas
  on a baking sheet; when frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag. Do
  not defrost before browning.
  
  1.  Toss the shrimp with 1 teaspoon of the salt and let them stand
  for 10 minutes.  Rinse thoroughly, drain, and pat dry. Finely chop
  the shrimp and put them into a mixing bowl. Add the remaining salt
  and the ginger, wine, cornstarch, water chestnuts, green onions,
  coriander, sausages and cheese: mix thoroughly.
  
  2.  If you are using won ton wrappers, trim the corners to make them
  round. Place 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of a
  wrapper. Moisten the edge of the wrapper with water and fold it in
  half to enclose the filling and form a half circle.  Pinch the edges
  together to seal. Set the gyoza on a baking sheet; cover it with a
  towel. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.
  
  3.  To cook and sauce 4 servings, add 1 tablespoon of oil to a 10-
  inch nonstick skillet and set it over medium heat. Arrange 12 gyozas
  in a single layer n the pan; pan-fry for 1 minute or until lightly
  browned. Turn the gyozas over and brown the other side, about 1
  minute longer. Add the chicken stock; shake the pan to prevent the
  gyozas from sticking. Cover and cook at a low boil for 2 minutes.
  Remove the gyozas to a plate and keep them warm.
  
  4.  Increase the heat to high and add the cream; bring to a boil and
  cook, stirring until thickened, about 45 seconds. Stir in the lime
  juice; season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  5.  To serve, divide the sauce among 4 plates; arrange 3 gyozas on
  each. Garnish with fresh coriander.
  
  From "Asian Appetizers" by Joyce Jue, Harlow and Ratner, 1991. ISBN
  0-9627345-1-9.
  
  This is a gorgeous book by a local Asian food columnist. She covers
  all of east Asia and includes some of the new "East/West" recipes
  that seem to be evolving in California.  The largest number of
  recipes are from Thailand and China but recipes from Indonesia,
  Japan, Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines are also included. She
  calls these 'appetizers' but most will easily serve as main courses.

  Ingredients:
  
  1/2 cup  margarine 1 cup flour 1 cup sugar 2 tsp baking powder 3/4
  cup milk or water 1 1lb can pitted cherries with syrup 1/2 cup sugar
  Melt the margarine and place in a baking pan.
  
  Mix the flour, sugar (1 cup only) baking powder and milk/water
  together. Pour on top of the melted margarine. DO NOT MIX!
  
  Pour the cherries with the syrup over the flour/milk mixture. DO NOT
  MIX! Sprinkle the 1/2 cup suger over the entire mess, and bake in a
  350 degree oven for one hour.
  
  This can be served either hot or cold.  If served hot, icecream would
  definately not detract from this dish.
  
  Variations:
  
  Basically any kind of canned fruit can be used.  I've made plum
  pudding (a la Little Jack Horner), pineapple pudding, whatever come
  to mind and off the shelf. Just remember that if the fruit has pits,
  to remove them.
  
  I tried this once with fresh fruit, and it just didn't work. This is
  one of those dishes meant for canned fruit. Converted by MMCONV vers.

      Title: EASY CHICKEN & RICE CASSEROLE
 Categories: Poultry, Rice, Easy
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 x  Chicken (white or dark)
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
      1 pk Lipton rice and sauce
 
  Uncle Ben's box or envelope of flavored rice (wild or pilaf, etc.)
  can be substituted for Lipton's Rice 'n' Sauce, but if you use plain
  white rice, use long cooking kind (not Minute) and you will have to
  add spices to your taste:  curry, paprika, pepper, etc. whatever you
  wish. The small packets of Lipton's or Uncle Ben's usually have their
  own flavor pak and no spices need to be added unless you like extra
  pepper. Combine dry rice, flavor pak if there is one, can of cream of
  mushroom (or cream of chicken or cream of celery) soup, and 1/2 to 1
  full can of water after that. Stir well with fork as soup will be
  lumpy.  Add washed and skinned pieces of chicken and sink them down
  into the liquid. Bake at 375 for 45 minutes to an hour depending on
  type of rice--wild rice takes a little longer. When rice is done,
  chicken is done. Watch during cooking and if rice begins to dry out,
  add water.  If bake at 400 cooking time is less.  If mixture was
  relatively soupy before putting in oven, bake uncovered, but if
  mixture was not very soupy bake covered. The soupier the mixture when
  goes in oven (how much water you added) the less you will need to
  watch it while baking. If it is looking like it is going to still be
  soupy towards time for it to get done, take cover off.  One more
  thing, cleanup is easier if you sprayed baking dish (glass) with Pam
  or other cooking spray before you put the ingredients in the dish
  (sorry!)

  * drain juice into small saucepan, and set clams aside.
  
  Add garlic and seasonings to clam juice, bring to a simmer, and let
  cook while the pasta cooks.  Drain pasta and return to pot in which
  it was cooked. Remove juices from heat, add clams, and pour over
  cooked pasta. Toss well and let stand a few minutes so juices can
  permeate the pasta well before you serve it. I understand that it is
  not chic to use grated parmesan or romano cheese with a seafood
  sauce, but we love romano on this. These canned clams must not be
  cooked--they turn into rocks if you do.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All purpose flour
    3/4 c  Corn meal
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 ea Egg, beaten
 
   Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Grease 8 or 9 inch baking pan. Combine dry
  ingredients.  Stir in milk, oil and egg, mixing just until dry
  ingredients are moistened. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 20 -
  25 minutes or until lightly brown and wooden tooth pick inserted near
  center comes out clean. Serve warm.  Serves 9. Microwave directions:
  Mix ingredients same as above and pour batter into UNGREASED pan.
  Microwave on HIGH 5 - 6 minutes, rotating 1/4 turn after 2 minutes.
  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
   Hope this is simple enough.....  As the recipe says...only mix
  ingredients until moistened.  If you beat it too much it would come
  out solid rather than light and airy. I cover the baking pan with
  Saran Wrap leaving part of one corner pulled back for steam to get
  out when I put it in the microwave...seems to help it bake more
  evenly. The center will seem a little soggy when you take it out but
  remember it continues to cook during that 5 minutes before you serve
  it. Time also makes a difference depending on the wattage of your
  micro. I think I leave mine in for about 7 minutes.

      Title: EASY CREAM CHEESE PASTRY
 Categories: Bakery, Pastry, Pie/tart, Typed
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Unsalted butter; room temp
      8 oz Cream cheese; room temp
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 c  To 2-1/3 cups flour
    1/4 c  To 2/3 cup powdered sugar
           Optional
 
  The dough for this melt-in-your-mouth pastry is very easy to handle
  as long as it is first thoroughly chilled. The pastry is perfect for
  any fruit pie or fruit/jam filled turnover.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Cream the butter, cream cheese and vanilla in a mixing
  bowl. Gradually sift 2 cups of the flour into the bowl, mixing with a
  fork until the dough forms a ball. Add a little more flour if the
  dough is too sticky. Divide the dough in half. Wrap in plastic wrap
  and refrigerate 45 minutes or overnight.
  
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
  
  Lightly sprinkle a work surface with some of the remaining flour or
  powdered sugar. Flatten one dough ball into a thick disk. Lightly
  dust the dough and a rolling pin with a little flour or powdered
  sugar. Using short even strokes, roll the dough from the center into
  a circle 2 inches larger than the pie pan you plan to use, turning
  the dough every few strokes and dusting it with flour or powdered
  sugar as needed. roll to about 1/8 inch thickness.
  
  Lift the dough off the working surface with a pastry scraper and fold
  it in half and then into quarters to form a triangle. Place the
  pointed end of the triangle into the center of the pie pan and unfold
  so the dough drapes about 1/2 inch beyond the rim of the pan. (Or
  carefully roll the dough onto the rolling pin and transfer to the pie
  pan.) With your fingertips, firmly press the dough into the pan.
  Prick the bottom all over with a fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes,
  just until pale golden.
  
  Freeze the remaining dough for another use. To make a double crusted
  pie, fill the shell. Roll the remaining dough to fit the top of the
  pie pan. Brush the rim of the shell with water and place the dough
  over the filling. Crimp with your finger or press the tines of a fork
  dipped in flour into the dough around the rim to seal.
  
  Makes one 8 or 9 inch double pie crust, OR
    ... one 10 inch single pie crust, OR
    ... six 8 inch triangular turnovers, OR
    ... 12 to 15 small tarts.

  with cornmeal. Set muffins on these, fairly far apart. Let rise to
  double in bulk. Set griddle or electric frypan to 350~. Sprinkle with
  cornmeal. Put muffins, rounded side down, on griddle and bake 7
  minutes. Turn and bake 7 minutes on the other side. Split with fork,
  and toast or spread with butter and put under broiler until butter
  bubbles.
     These muffins freeze successfully. They should be split with fork

      Title: EASY FRUIT CAKE (OVO)
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Apple sauce
    3/4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Sugar.
  2 1/2 c  Mixed dried fruit.
           (I like to use half
           Currants, half raisins.)
      2    Egg whites or equivalent,
           Lightly beaten.
  1 1/2 c  White flour.
           (Whole wheat is OK, but it
           Changes the taste.)
      2 ts Baking powder.
 
  Place the apple sauce, water, sugar, and dried fruit in a saucepan.
  Bring to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes, then allow to cool.
  
  Set the oven at 300 deg F (cool). Line a 6-inch round cake tin with
  greaseproof paper.
  
  Mix the egg whites into the fruit mixture, then sift the flour and
  baking powder into it too. Mix, adding water if necessary to make a
  stiff batter. Pour into the prepared tin, sprinkle the top with brown
  sugar, and bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until a skewer inserted into
  the centre of the cake comes out clean, more or less - with all this
  fruit, it's not going to come out very clean anyway!
  
  The amount and type of fruit in this recipe can be varied very much to
  produce different results. Many folk in this country would use
  sultanas (yellow raisins) for some of the fruit, but I don't like
  them so I don't use them. You can substitute 1/2 cup of chopped glace
  cherries for some of the fruit, or add chopped candied orange peel,
  dates, apricots... The possibilities are endless.

 Categories: Drinks, Alcohol
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      6 oz Limeade, frozen
      6 oz Vodka
      6 oz Water
           Ice
 
  Blend equal parts of limeade, vodka and water in a blender. Add ice
  and blend to slushiness desired. More ice makes it slushier.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Vodka margaritas.  Yield:  Serves 3-4.
  
  *  Officially, a margarita calls for tequila instead of the vodka,
  with a splash of triple sec.  No one notices the absence of the
  triple sec and many people prefer the taste of vodka.
  
  : Difficulty:  trivial.
  : Time:  2 minutes.
  : Precision:  use equal measures of the ingredients.

      Title: EASY MUSHROOM FILLED TORTILLIAS
 Categories: Mexico
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Fresh mushrooms
      5 tb Olive oil
           Salt
           Pepper
           Oregano
           Marjoram
           Garlic
    1/2    Bell pepper, sliced
           - into bite-sized strips
    1/2 sm Onion, thinly sliced
           -and separated into rings
      1 c  Prepared salsa
      2    Flour tortillias
           Shreded cheddar cheese
 
  Heat tortillias in oven along with serving plate at low temp, as per
  package directions (ie: in foil so they don't dry out). (If you plan
  to do this in the microwave, wait.)
  
  Saute mushrooms, bell pepper, onions, garlic, with seasonings in oil.
  I prefer somewhat crunchy bell peppers, so i begin sauteing
  everything before cutting up the pepper. This seems to get the timing
  right. When the vegetables have reached
  
  the desired level of doneness -- I like my mushrooms cooked to death
  ~- pour into the pan the salsa. Cook together for several more
  minutes.
  
  Place the cheese and mushroom mixture in the tortilla, roll and serve.
  
  (This is a "what is edible in my refrigerator" recipe that actually
  turned out well. So i thought i'd share. I never thought of mushrooms
  in "Mexican" food before. 'Course we made shark fajitas a few weeks
  ago with soy sauce, so "authentic" doesn't seem to make a dent with
  me except for how i fix refried beans.) -- Judith Elaine Bush

      Title: EASY PARKER HOUSE ROLLS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Milk; scalded
      2 ts Butter or regular margarine
      2 pk Active dry yeast; or
    1/4 c  Lukewarm water; 110 deg. f.
      2 ts Butter or margarine; melted
      3 ts Sugar
    3/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Active dry yeast; bulk
  4 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
 
  Pour the scalded milk over the sugar, 2 tbls of butter and salt in a
  mixing bowl.  Cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast over the lukewarm
  water and stir to dissolve. Add 2 cups of flour, and the yeast
  mixture to the milk mixture.  Beat, with an electric mixer on medium
  speed, until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gradually add enough of the
  remaining flour to make a soft dough, then cover and let rest for 15
  minutes. Knead the dough a few times on a lightly floured surface
  until it is no longer sticky and roll out to a 1/2-inch thickness.
  Cut into rounds, using a floured biscuit cutter. Brush the rounds
  with the remaining 2 Tbls of melted butter and crease each roll in
  the center with the dull edge of a knife. Fold the rolls over on the
  crease and press the edges together lightly. Place on greased baking
  sheets and cover. Let rise in a warm place until almost doubled,
  about 30 minutes. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F. oven for 10
  minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from the baking sheets and
  cool on wire racks. NOTE: These rolls are almost a must at the
  Holiday dinners coming up shortly. Restaurants and most older cooks
  make it a tradition to serve them.

 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Bag pinto beans
      2 pk Onion soup mix
 
  I put a bag of pinto beans in my crock pot with water and let them
  cook several hours until softened and then wondered how was I going
  to season them.  After browsing my pantry for several moments I
  decided to throw in 2 packages of onion soup mix.
  
  Suffice it to say, they turned out wonderfully, (I've added nothing
  else) and my 6 year old, who hates beans of any kind, had two bowls
  last night and another today.
  
  As far as I know, the soup is fat free.  And surprisingly ... no gas!
  I don't know if the onions have anything to do with this, but thought
  I'd throw that in. ;-)

      2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
      1 pk Dry yeast (or 1 tb)
      5 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      2 ts Salt
 
  In mixing bowl, combine water and sugar; sprinkle yeast and let stand
  for 10 minutes or until dissolved and creamy. Using electric mixer,
  beat in 2 c. of the flour, oil and salt; beat for about 3 minutes or
  until smooth, scraping down side of bowl from time to time. With
  wooden spoon, beat in enough of the remaining flour to make stiff
  dough. Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead for about 10
  minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place dough in lightly greased
  bowl, turning to grease all over. Cover with plastic wrap and let
  rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk. Divide dough into
  16 or 32 pieces. On lightly floured surface, roll each piece into 7"
  or 4" rounds. Cover and let rise for 15 minutes or until slightly
  risen.  Meanwhile, heat ungreased baking sheet on lowest rack in 500
  degree oven (240 C). Using floured metal spatula, quickly transfer 2
  or 3 pita rounds to heated baking sheet; bake for 3 or 4 minutes or
  until puffed and light golden around edges. Repeat with remaining
  pita rounds. Let cool between damp tea towels. Pitas will collapse
  and soften slightly, but pocket will remain. (Alternatively, if crisp
  pitas are desired, let cool on racks) Pitas can be stored in plastic
  bags in freezer for up to 1 month.  Makes 16 7" pitas or 32 4" pitas.

  20-30 minutes to blend flavors.  Add fish; cover and simmer over low
  heat for 15-25 minutes, or until fish flakes easily when tested with
  a fork. (NOTE: Avoid using high heat.  Boiling action will break up
  fish.)  Lift cooked fish carefully from liquid with wide spatula.

      Title: EASY REFRIGERATOR ROLLS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
  6 1/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Yeast, dry (each
           -pk is about 1 T)
    1/2 c  Milk
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Butter
      1    Egg
           Vegetable shortening
           -or more butter
 
  Combine 2 cups of flour, sugar, salt and undissolved yeast.
  
  Heat milk, water and butter until liquids are very warm (120-130
  degrees F.). Add to dry ingredients. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed
  (I've never used an electric mixer, by the way. Just stir until
  things are evenly combined and not terribly lumpy.) Add egg and about
  1 cup flour. Beat at high speed 2 minutes. Add enough additional
  flour to make a soft dough. This is where the arm muscles get their
  exercise!
  
  Grease top of dough (with butter or vegetable shortening). Cover the
  bowl and refrigerate it overnight.
  
  Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces.  Shape them into balls and
  place each in a greased muffin cup. Cover; let rise in a warm place
  (75-100 degrees F.) until doubled. This will take between 1 and 1 1/2
  hours. Towards the end of the rising period, preheat the oven to 400
  degrees F. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 12 to 15 minutes. Store the
  rolls tightly covered, that is, if there are any left.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An utterly reliable recipe for yeast rolls -- I believe this recipe
  started its life on the back of a Fleischman's Yeast package, but it
  has been memorized and modified for about ten years now. It is the
  most reliable yeast recipe I've ever seen: it's never failed on me,
  and it always does an amazing amount of rising (my family calls them
  mushroom rolls).
  
  *  This is the first really good yeast bread recipe I discovered when
  I started making bread in the sixth grade. Done carefully, it can
  approach a delicate, cake-like texture. It doesn't have to be shaped
  into rolls, of course -- try it in a regular bread pan, or in fancy
  shapes.
  
  *  I use Fleischman's dry yeast.  I suppose cake yeast can be used,
  but it always seemed like a nuisance to me.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1 hour of work spread over 2 days.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: EASY ROASTED CHICKEN
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           SEE DIRECTIONS:
 
  Although this REAL BBQ it is an easy way to cook a whole chicken on a
  gas grill!
  
  And you thought gas grills were for those fat, white legged guys you
  see in the neighborhood every Sunday burning steak. This recipe is so
  simple that I always wonder why those "Famous" TV cooks have not
  demonstrated it.
  
  I call it Easy Roasted Chicken.
  
  Split a whole 3 pound chicken by cutting up the middle of the breast
  bone. Press the chicken flat, and rub both sides, plus under the skin
  around the breast, with the following concoction:
  
  *  6 tablespoons onion powder * 3 tablespoons sugar * 3 tablespoons
  garlic powder * 4 teaspoons dried thyme flakes * 4 teaspoons ground
  cinnamon * 3 tablespoons ground allspice * 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
  * 3 tablespoons fresh-ground pepper * 1 dried habanero chile, chopped
  fine or 2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (optional)
  
  Mix the spices thoroughly in a bowl. Store remainder in a covered jar
  in a cool pantry.
  
  Light both sides of your gas grill and leave them on high for ten
  minutes or until the lava rocks are hot. Shut off one side of the
  grill and turn the other side to its lowest setting. Place the
  chicken, skin side up, on the off side of the grill. Close the cover
  and let it cook for 45 minutes. Raise the cover and turn the chicken
  90 degrees, close the cover and finish cooking for another 45
  minutes. Test the thigh for doneness with an instant reading meat
  thermometer. About 180 degrees is okay or pull the wing, it should
  come off easily. Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest
  for at least ten minutes before slicing.

      Title: EASY ROASTED VEGETABLE PASTA SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    Red bell peppers, sliced in
           1/2 inch wide strips
      3    Big onions, or 4 small
           Onions
    1/2    Garlic bulb
      1 lb Mushrooms, cleaned and
           Sliced
      2    Jars ff spaghetti sauce or
           Omemade equivelent
      2 tb Fresh basil, minced
        x  Pasta: Use penne,rigatoni or
           Some other substantial
           Pasta
 
  Preheat oven to 400. You will need 2 non-stick standard size baking
  sheets. Cut the bell peppers into strips and place on a non-stick
  baking sheet, skin side down. Cut the onions into thick (1/2") slices
  and place on baking sheet. Peel the skin off the garlic cloves and
  set the cloves on top of the onion slices (one clove per onion
  slice). Bake at 400 for 30-40 minutes. The vegetables should be soft
  and have just a few brown spots.
  
  While the vegetables roast, slice the mushrooms and saute them in 1 T
  water in the bottom of a big saucepan. When they are cooked, add the
  2 jars of spaghetti sauce and the basil.  Warm the whole sauce
  through and allow to simmer until the roasted vegetables are done.
  Dump the roasted vegetables into the sauce and stir to separate the
  onion rings.
  
  Serve over penne pasta (which was cooking while you made the sauce
  since you think ahead, of course). Ridiculously simple, but it tastes
  good.

      Title: EASY SPINACH MANICOTTI
 Categories: Low, Fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Manicotti pasta (jumbo
           Shells will also do)
      1    Jar of your favorite pasta
           Sauce
      1    Container of fat free
           Ricotta cheese
      1    Egg white (or fave egg
           Replacer)
      1 cn Spinach (or use frozen if
           You can?t find it canned)
      1 pk Shredded fat free mozzarella
           Cheese
 
  Cook manicotti or shells until almost done. Meaning the pasta should
  still be a little hard. Drain and cool. In a bowl, mix ricotta
  cheese, spinach, egg white with half of tje package mozzarella
  cheese. Mixture should be a little thick -- not runny. If runny, add
  more mozzarella cheese. Add about 3 tablespoons of pasta sauce to
  mixture and whatever herbs you prefer... basil, oregano, parsley, etc.
  
  When manicotti is cool, stuff with mixture and place in a baking pan.
  Top with remaining pasta sauce and sprinkle remaining mozzarella
  cheese. Bake for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees or until cheese is
  fully melted on top.
  
  This freezes well. I generally make this the night before and
  refrigerate it for the next day. Yum!

      Title: EASY SWEET & SOUR CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless
      1 ts Ginger, chopped
      1    Egg white
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -(peanut oil is best,
           -but sunflower is
           -good, too)
      1    Green (bell) pepper
      6    Carrots
     12 oz Pineapple chunks, canned
           -(drained, but reserve
           -about 1/2 cup of
           -the juice)
           SAUCE
      2 ts Sherry
      2 ts Light soy sauce
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 ts Sugar
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 ts Salt
 
  Cut up the chicken into bite-sized chunks.  Combine ginger, egg white,
  about 1/2 teaspoons each salt and cornstarch, and about 1 teaspoon
  oil. Add the chicken chunks and stir until the chicken is well-coated.
  
  Wash green pepper.  Discard seeds and stem.  Cut into strips about 1
  x 1/4 inches.  Peel carrots.  If they are thick, cut in half
  lengthwise. Cut diagonally into pieces about 1 inch long. Cook the
  carrots in boiling water for 3-5 minutes, depending how crunchy you
  like your carrots.
  
  Drain pineapple chunks, saving about 1/2 cup of the juice. Prepare the
  sweet and sour sauce by mixing sherry, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar,
  reserved pineapple juice, about 1 tablespoon cornstarch, and about 1
  teaspoon salt. Stir well and set aside.
  
  Heat about 3 tablespoon of oil very hot in a wok or deep cast iron
  pan. Peanut oil is best since it has a high smoking point. Stir-fry
  the chicken by putting a small batch (e.g., 5 pieces) of the cubed
  chicken in the wok and stirring continuously until golden brown.
  Remove to a dish. Repeat until all the chicken has been cooked,
  adding small amounts of oil as it gets used up.
  
  Heat about 1 tablespoon oil in an empty wok.  Stir fry the parboiled
  carrots and the green pepper for 30 seconds. Add the chicken and the
  pineapple chunks to the vegetables in the wok. Stir 1 minute or until
  well mixed and reheated. Add sweet and sour sauce to wok. Stir until
  thickened.
  
  Serve with rice.  I serve this recipe to company all the time and am
  amazed at how many people don't realize that you can cook Chinese
  food at home. It is always a big hit. The recipe works equally well
  with lean pork, tofu cubes, or soy beans instead of the chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A nice Chinese dinner you can make at home -- Don't forget to start
  cooking the rice so it will be done at the same time as the chicken.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the sauce ingredients.

MMMMM---------------------------PART 1--------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Lean pork butt or fresh ham
   3/16 c  Soya sauce
   3/16 c  Sherry
           Salt
      2 tb Oil

MMMMM---------------------------PART 2--------------------------------
    1/2 c  White sugar
    1/2 c  White vinegar
  1 1/2 tb Corn starch, dissolved in
    1/4 c  Water
    1/4 c  Pineapple juice
      3 tb Tomato soup

MMMMM------------------SUGGESTED EMBELLISHMENTS-----------------------
    1/4 c  Pineapple chunks
           Few pieces of raw carrot,
           -sliced or shredded
    1/2    Green pepper shredded
      1    Tomato, cut into wedges
    1/2 c  Mixed sweet pickles
 
  PART 1:
  
  1. Cut pork into 1/2x1/2x1" rectangles. Marinate in mixture of salt,
  soya sauce and sherry for at least half an hour. While meat is
  marinating, prepare Part 2.
  
  2. Add 2 tablespoons oil to wok and heat up to smoking point. Take a
  slotted spoon and use it to lift pork pieces from marinate, place in
  wok and brown meat on all sides. Lower heat slightly to medium high
  and continue to cook meat for a full 15 minutes, using turner to stir
  pieces occasionally.
  
  3. At end of cooking time, place meat in serving dish. Pour sauce
  from Part 2 over it.
  
  PART 2:
  
  1. Place white sugar and vinegar in a small 1 quart pot. Boil together
  until sugar is dissolved. Stir up corn starch in 1/4 cup water. Add to
  vinegar-sugar boil. Stir solution, lower heat to medium low, add
  pineapple juice and tomato soup. Boil solution 15-20 minutes, until
  it turns from milky red to a clear reddish yellow.
  
  2. Add suggested embellishments. You can use all of them or some of
  them. Cook 2 minutes. Serve over Part 1.
  
  NOTE: Pork spare ribs cut into 1 1/2" lengths may be used in place of
  pork butt. However, spare ribs have more fat than fresh ham or pork
  butt, so use 1 tablespoon less oil in stir-frying ribs or else
  discard fat which accumulates in wok when ribs are finished cooking.
  Also Part 2 (sans embellishments) can be made in a larger quantity
  and store in a covered plastic container in refrigerator for 2-3
  weeks.

  use a 5-1/2 on a scale of 8, on the big burner of my stove), stirring
  constantly. Boil 13 to 18 minutes (13 is always enough for me),
  stirring *constantly*. DO NOT let up on the stirring, or it will
  stick!  Pour into the jellyroll pan and spread. Let cool for a few
  minutes, then place the chocolate bars on top. When the chocolate is
  mushy, spread it evenly over the surface of the candy and sprinkle
  with the remaining pecans.

           -CRUST:
      4 oz Chocolate wafers

      2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
      2 tb Sugar
      3 tb Vegetable oil,
           -preferably canola oil

  until you have fine crumbs. Add oil and 3 Tbsp. water; process till
  the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and
  about 1-1/2 inches up the sides of the prepared pan. Set aside. To
  make filling: Melt chocoalte in top of a double boiler over hot, not
  boiling, water or in a microwave oven at medium (50%) power. Let cool
  slightly. Dissolve instant coffee in 1 Tbsp. boiling water and set
  aside. Place cottage cheese in a strainer lined with a double
  thickness of cheesecloth. Gather up the cheesecloth and squeeze out
  moisture from cottage cheese. Put pressed cottage-cheese solids in a
  food processor and blend until smooth. Add cream cheese, sugar, egg,
  egg whites, sour cream, cocoa, cornstarch, salt, vanilla the melted
  chocolate and the dissolved coffee; process until smooth. Pour into
  the crust-lined pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until firm around the
  edge but still shiny and slightly soft in the center. Run a knife
  around the pan to loosen edges. Let cool in the pan on a rack. Cover
  and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 8 hours or for up to 2
  days. Remove sides. To facilitate cutting, dip a sharp knife in hot
  water and wipe dry before cutting each slice. Serves 16.
  
  COMMENTS: This cheesecake recipe is a new version of a
  
  chocoholic's dream. It contains less than a third of the fat of the
  original recipe. The careful balance of flavorings achieves a very
  rich tasting cake.

      Title: ECH NAU CA-RI (CURRIED FROGS' LEGS)
 Categories: Vietnam, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4    Pairs of jumbo frog's legs
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass, or
      1 tb Dried lemon grass
      2    Fresh red chilies, seeded
           -and sliced
      2    Shallots, sliced
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Curry paste
      2 ts Curry powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Nuoc mam (fish sauce)
      2 oz Cellophane noodles
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      1 c  Chicken broth or water
    1/2 c  Coconut milk or heavy cream
      1 ts Cornstarch
           Fresh ground black pepper
           Coriander sprigs for garnish
 
  This delicious lemon grass and coconut-laced curry comes from southern
  Vietnam. If you prefer a very hot curry, simply use more chile
  peppers.
  
  Cut the frogs' legs into bite-size pieces. Rinse with cold water to
  remove any chipped bones. Pat dry and refrigerate.
  
  If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and
  upper half of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you
  are using dried lemon grass, soak it in warm water for 1 hour. Drain
  and finely chop.
  
  In a blender, combine the lemon grass with the chiles, shallots,
  garlic, sugar, curry paste, curry powder, salt and 1 tablespoon of
  the fish sauce. Process to a very fine paste. Rub the paste over the
  frogs' legs. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 2-inch sections.
  
  Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute
  until translucent. Add the frogs' legs and brown well on all sides,
  about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce
  the heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
  
  Uncover the pan and add the coconut milk, the cornstarch diluted in 1
  tablespoon of cold water and the remaining 1 table- spoon fish sauce.
  Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.
  
  Add the cellophane noodles and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove
  from the heat.
  
  Sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs.
  
  Serve immediately with rice, French bread or over rice noodles.
  
  Note: Instead of discarding the upper half of the lemon grass, crush
  it and cook it with the frogs' legs for extra flavor. Remove the
  stalk before serving.
  
  Yield: 4 servings.

      Title: ED'S PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 3 Pounds
 
      1 lb Peanut butter, smooth
           -(natural)
      1 lb Sugar, powdered
    1/2 lb Butter (2 sticks,
           -save the wrappers)
      1 ts Vanilla extract
     12 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet
           -(otherwise known as
           -1 bag chocolate chips)
 
  Melt the chocolate in a bowl over hot water or the top of a double
  boiler. Make sure you don't get even a drop of water in the
  chocolate. Stir frequently with a spatula while doing the following
  steps and remove it from the hot water just as soon as it's melted.
  
  Melt the butter.  Mix together the powdered sugar, the melted butter
  and the vanilla. Don't bother sifting the powdered sugar. Just stir
  everything together with a wooden spoon until it's smooth and creamy.
  Stir in the peanut butter. This will break most flimsy wooden spoons
  if you're not careful. Mushing everything together with your hands
  works well and is lots of fun.
  
  Press the fudge into a buttered 8 or 9 square pan. You don't need much
  butter, just wipe the butter papers over the inside of the pan. You
  can also line the pan with foil and butter that; this works
  especially well if you're making several batches in a row to give to
  people as holiday presents. Press the fudge in firmly; you don't want
  any air bubbles in it. You will get your hands messy here.
  
  Pour the chocolate over the fudge and spread it in an even layer. The
  easiest way to do this is to shake the pan gently until the chocolate
  is even.  Let the chocolate cool to room temperature. DO NOT PUT IT
  IN THE REFRIGERATOR.
  
  Using a sharp knife cut the fudge into 1 squares.  If you defied my
  instructions and put it in the refrigerator, the chocolate layer will
  shatter when you try to cut it. Unless you are going to serve it
  immediately, store it in the refrigerator. Let it come to room
  temperature before serving.
  
  Again, don't scrimp on the peanut butter!  Skippy simply will not do.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An extremely rich candy -- I got this recipe from a friend, Ed
  Firestone, who is arguably the best cook in Palo Alto. The results
  resemble Reese's Peanut Butter Cups that have attained Nirvana. Don't
  scrimp on the peanut butter; get the best you can find or make it
  yourself. If there's anything besides peanuts and salt in it, find
  another brand.
  
  *  Unless you use the foil method, you will inevitably destroy at
  least one piece getting it out of the pan. The best method is to line
  the pan with foil, let the fudge cool, lift it out, peel off the
  foil, put it back in the pan and cut it. This keeps it from sticking
  to the pan. If you try to cut it out of the pan, it tends to fall
  apart.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Seafood, Main dish, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 sm Loaves French Bread
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
      2 tb Melted butter
      3    Doz fresh oysters
      2 tb Melted butter
           Milk
 
  First, almost split the loaves lengthwise, leaving a hinge. Scoop out
  the soft middle and save the crumbs. Then add a 1/2 tsp of garlic
  powder (not salt) to 2 Tbls melted butter, and brush the cavities.
  
  Next, drain the oysters and save the liquid.  Saute' them in the rest
  of the butter till the edges curl - about 5 minutes. Put the oysters
  into the loaves, mix the crumbs you saved with the oyster liquid you
  saved, and add them, too.  Shut up the loaves now. STOP HERE.
  
  Then wrap them in cheesecloth dipped in milk, twisting the ends and
  tucking them under the loaf.  Bake them on a baking sheet for half an
  hour at 350^. Cut them in half before you serve them.
  
        6    servings
  
  (Note from the book: Eddy was a San Franciscan who owned a bar and
  made small oyster loaves for his married male customers to take home
  to their wives. These were pacifiers. But Eddy is dead now, and
  Mother must pacify herself.  This is good for a special lunch. I also
  know a family who has it traditionally as Christmas Eve supper.)

      Title: EDEN MISO INFORMATION
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  The variety of color, flavor and texture you'll find in EDEN Misos is
  a reflection of the ingredients and climate in which they were made.
  Whole beans and grains are cleaned, steamed, inoculated with koji
  (Aspergillus oryzae), which is also used in the production of shoyu,
  tamari and rice vinegar) and mixed with sea salt, then aged in wooden
  kegs weighted with stones to allow time, temperature and climate to
  create a uniquelY satisfying food.
  
  Hacho Miso              Soybean
  ================================================ Hacho Miso is dark
  and rich. It is aged a full 3 years. Use it alone when an intense
  flavor is desired, or use mixed half-and-half with any other Miso for
  soups, dressings or marinade. Mugi Miso Barley
  ================================================ Mugi Miso is made
  with soYbeans and barley koji. It matures in 1-2 years, and has a
  milder aroma than Hacho Miso. It is perhaps the most universally
  appealing of all the misos, suitable for summer or winter cooking.
  
  Kome Miso                Rice
  ================================================ Kome Miso is made
  with soybeans and rice koji, and is the sweetest of the Misos. There
  are many variations, including Shiro (Sweet White) Miso and Genmai
  (Brown Rice) 1Miso.
  
  Shiro Miso               Sweet Rice
  ================================================ Shiro Miso, sometimes
  called "white miso", is the "youngest" Miso (made in just 40 days).
  Like Kome Miso it has a light, sweet taste, suitable for use in a
  wide variety of dishes.
  
  Genmai Miso               Brown Rice
  ================================================ Genmai Miso is made
  with brown rice koji. As contradictory as it may seem, this is a new
  and not a traditional food. Prompted by many requests, a method was
  developed for making koji from whole brown rice. The result is a
  delightfully rich miso with a light flavor. Soba Miso Buckwheat
  ================================================ Soba Miso, made with
  buckwheat and soybeans, is a hearty variety that tastes especially
  good in cold weather.

      Title: EDEN OILS & VINEGARS
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  TRADITIONALLY MADE OILS ======================= EDEN offers two
  traditionally made toasted sesame oils. They reflect the finest
  ingredients and processing. Unrefined and expeller processed, they
  have the full color and flavor of sesame.  Using a slow screw press
  ensures low temperture extraction, protecting the natural vitamin E
  that guards against oxidation. Filtering through vegetable quality
  filters removes small particles while maintaining flavor and
  nutrients. A nitrogen flush when bottling preserves freshness by
  driving off oxygen than can cause oxidative damage.
  
  TOASTED SESAME OIL - EDEN Toasted Sesame Oil is made by gently
  pressing whole seeds that have been dry-roasted to release their oil.
  Its distinctive flavor and aroma is commonly a part of oriental
  cooking. Toasted Sesame Oil is also known as 'oriental oil' or
  'Chinese oil' in recipes, and some writers refer to it as 'dark'
  sesame oil. This delicious and nutritious oil complements any grain,
  pasta, or vegetable, and will add pleasing character to your sauces
  and dressings.
  
  Ingredients: Toasted Sesame Oil Sizes: 5 or 10 ounce glass
  
  ******************************************************* *************
  
  HOT PEPPER SESAME OIL - EDEN Hot Pepper Sesame Oil is a fiery hot
  combination of toasted sesame oil and red chili peppers. Whole red
  chili peppers release their essential oil when steeped in toasted
  sesame oil, producing a strong but balanced 'heat' in this specialty
  condiment/cooking oil.  Use in sautes, sauces or dressings for a
  zesty heat.
  
  Ingredients: Toasted Sesame Oil, Red Chili Peppers Sizes: 5 or 10
  ounce glass
  
  ******************************************************* **************
  
  SPECIALTY VINEGARS Unrefined ============================ EDEN Brown
  Rice Vinegar and Ume Plum Vinegar are delicious condiments made the
  traditional way, as they have been for centuries, with meticulous
  care, 'the best' being the only goal.  Natural fementation of whole
  foods is acheived without the addition of modern additives. Lightly
  filtered only through cotton cloth to retain full flavor and
  nourishment.
  
  BROWN RICE VINEGAR - EDEN Brown Rice Vinegar is made by artisans from
  whole grain rice and pure well water. Through a slow and laborious
  maturing process it mellows and sweetens naturally in unglazed
  earthenware vats. This exceptional vinegar experiences seasonal
  changes for three years in a climate perfectly suited to and
  necessary for its production. It is surprisingly sweet and smooth
  unlike most types of vinegar. It is the vinegar of choice for sushi -
  'sushi' literally translates to 'vinegar rice'.
  
  Ingredients: Water, Brown Rice Sizes: 5 or 10 ounce glass
  
  ******************************************************* **************
  
  UME VINEGAR - EDEN Ume Plum Vinegar begins with a rare variety of plum
  appreciated for the remarkable properties embodied in PlumBalls (TM)
  and umeboshi. This vinegar is created as umeboshi (pickled plums) are
  made. Fresh plums are rotated from shiso (beefsteak leaves) bring to
  sun drying, then back to the brine over and over, creating this
  flavorful vinegar. Shiso leaves gives it its red color; its tart
  flavor is from the organic acid rich ume plum. Technically a brine,
  but always called vinegar because of its tartness, this condiment
  sparks salads, dips, and dressing with its healthful character.

      Title: EDEN SEA VEGETABLES INFORMATION
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  There is no better vegetable source of minerals than sea vegetables.
  Like the mineral-rich ocean, sea vegetables hold high quality
  calcium, iron, potassium, zinc, and trace minerals including iodine.
  They also contain vitamins A, B, C, D, E. EDEN Chooses only the
  finest grades of sea vegetables. Grown in environmentally clean
  waters, these premium grades are harvested at their nutritional peak
  and processed using traditional techniques.
  
  AGAR-AGAR - gelatin from a variety of seaweeds, cooked together and
  allowed to harden; it is then cut into bars or made into flakes. Used
  in kantens, gelatins, jams, jellies, and toppings.
  
  ARAME - a black seaweed with a mild, sweet flavor. Arame is great with
  other vegetables, or alone seasoned with brown rice vinegar and shoyu.
  
  HIZIKI - black curls of seagrass; one of the most mineral rich foods.
  A serving contains 10% of the daily recommended calcium intake. Very
  tasty cooked with other vegetables for interesting and nutritious
  side dishes.
  
  KOMBU - sea kelp, highly valued as a flavor enhancer. Kombu cooked
  with beans tenderizes them and makes them easier to digest. Use in
  beans, soup stocks, or stews.
  
  NORI - green laver or sea lettuce. Nori can be used as is, or toasted
  over an open flame or burner for a crisper texture. Crumble it into
  soups, vegetables or grains.
  
  SUSHI Nori - tender, premium nori sheets toasted to a rich, deep green
  color, ready-to-use for sushi. Can also be used as a condiment or
  garnish.
  
  WAKAME - best known for its beautiful green color and delicious taste
  in miso soup, but it is also wonderful in salads, side dishes, or as a
  condiment.
  
  WAKAME FLAKES - an instant form of wakame, good in soups, salads,
  stir-fry, and as a condiment. Quick and easy to use.

 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           None
 
  Not all flowers are edible. Some delicious looking plants are
  poisonous, and eating them could lead to serious illness or death.
  For instance, there are 60 commercial varieties of pansies, and only
  three that are specifically for eating. Choose flowers only from
  edible plants or those listed in a reliable source. Flowers also
  should be eaten only in the amounts specified in recipes.
  
  Persons who are prone to allergies can have an allergic reaction to
  flowers, as to any food. Proceed with caution when trying unfamiliar
  flowers. If you have any doubt about the identity of a flower, do not
  eat it. Your best bet is to use flowers commercially grown especially
  for eating.  Linda Beaulieu.

  nearly boiling, add a good pinch of cream of tartar and boil without
  stirring until it reaches 258 F. in cold weather or 260 F. in
  hot++that is, until it forms a hard lump in cold water. Remove from
  the fire, add colouring and flavouring, and pour on a buttered marble
  slab, preferably through buttered candy bars.  As it begins to cool,
  turn the ends and edges inwards with a buttered knife.  When cool
  enough to handle, dust it with powdered sugar, take it up and pull
  gently (being careful not to twist it) until it is dull.  Cut in
  pieces with a pair of scissors. Place the rock in a warm room and let
  it remain there for at least 24 hours, until the process of
  granulation is complete, and the rock is powdery and soft. "The
  original Edinburgh Rock is made by the famous Edinburgh firm of
  Ferguson. Confectionery is an important industry in the capital, and
  the world-famous rock is one of the triumphs of the Scottish

  Recipe by: Edinburgh Tearoom, Edinburgh SCONES
     Heat oven to 425~.  Sift dry ingredients together. Cut in butter.
  Add raisins or currents.  Mix buttermilk and egg together. Add all at
  once to flour. Mix with fork just until mixture clings together. Form
  into ball, turn out on floured surface and knead gently until smooth,
  not more than 5 turns of the dough. Pat out til 1/2 inch thick and
  cut with a 2" cutter. Place on baking sheet 1 inch apart. Brush tops
  lightly with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Bake 10 minutes until
  golden brown. Serve with Lemon Curd. LEMON CURD
     Beat eggs in top of double boiler. Stir in remaining ingredients.
  Cook over simmering water 30 minutes, stirring frequently until thick
  and smooth. (I do not use a double boiler, but use a low heat and
  watch closely to prevent burning). When it has thickened, remove from
  heat. It will thicken more when cooled. Cool, cover and refrigerate.
  Keeps 2 to 3 weeks in refrigerator. This has become a holiday
  breakfast tradition for our family and I give small jars of the Lemon
  Curd as gifts along with the Scone recipe for friends who bake.

      Title: EDNA LEWIS'S CHRISTMAS FRUITCAKE
 Categories: Xmas, Holidays, Cakes, Fruits
      Yield: 1 Tube cake
 
      1 c  Glazed candied orange peel;
           .  diced
      1 c  Glazed candied lemon peel;
           .  diced
      2 c  Citron; diced
      1 c  Currants
      2 c  Seedless raisins; chopped
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Brandy
  3 1/2 c  Flour; all-purpose
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 ts Nutmeg; grated
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Ground allspice
    1/2 ts Ground mace
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  + 6 Tbsp butter; softened
      2 c  Brown sugar; packed
      5    Eggs; separated
    1/2 c  Sorghum molasses
 
  Mix all the fruit in a large bowl and pour in the wine and brandy.
  Stir gently and set aside to marinate for a few hours.
  
  Butter a 10-inch tube pan or two 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pans and line
  it (or them) with clean parchment paper. Butter the paper.
  
  Sift the flour with the spices twice. Add the baking powder and salt
  and sift again.
  
  Put the butter into a large mixing bowl and cream until satiny. Add
  sugar and, using an electric mixer, cream until light and fluffy.
  Beat the egg yoLlcs slightly and then add them to the bowl. Mix the
  batter well before you start to add the flour-spice mixture. Stir the
  batter as you add the flour, a litde at a time, stirring well after
  each addition. When the flour is thoroughly incorporated, add the
  molasses and stir. Finally, stir in the fruit and any soaking liquid
  in the bowl.
  
  Put the egg whites in a grease-free bowl and beat with a clean beater
  until they hold stiff peaks. Fold them into the batter thor oughly
  and then spoon the batter into the prepared pan (or parns). Cover
  loosely with a clean cloth and let the batter sit overnight in a cool
  place to mellow.
  
  On the next day, heat the oven to 250 degrees. Place the fruitcake on
  the middle rack of the oven and bake for 3 1/2 to 4 hours. After 1
  1/2 hours, cover the pan with a piece of brown paper (do not use
  foil) or set the pan in a paper bag and return it to the oven.
  
  When the cake has baked for 3 1/2 hours, remove it from the oven and
  listen closely for any quiet, bubbling noises. If you "hear'' the
  cake, it needs more baking. Or test the cake with a toothpick or cake
  tester. If the toothpick or tester comes out of the center of the
  cake clean, the cake is ready to take from the oven. Put it on a wire
  rack to cool, still in the pan.
  
  When the cake is completely cool, turn it out of the pan (or pans),
  leaving the brown-paper lining on the cake. Wrap the cake with
  parchment, then aluminum foil, and pack the cake in a tin. Homemade
  fruitcakes need air, so punch a few holes in the lid of the tin or
  set the cover loosely on the tin.
  
  Set the tin in a cool, undisturbed place, and every two or three weeks
  before Christmas, open the foil and sprinkle the cake with a liqueur
  glassful of brandy, wine, or whiskey. The liquor will keep the cake
  moist and flavorful and help preserve it as well.

      Title: EELS IN PIQUANT SAUCE ( ALL I PEBRE)
 Categories: Appetizers, Sauces
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      4 lb Eel
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Paprika
      2 c  Hot water
      3    Garlic cloves; chopped
     14    Blanched almonds
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 ts Saffron
      1 tb Olive oil
           Salt to taste
 
  A favorite Valencian tapa as well as a popular main dish, especially
  along the Costa Blanca. A cold beer might go best with this piquant
  tapa.
  
  Clean and skin eels and cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces. Heat 1
  tablespoon olive oil in a casserole or skillet, add paprika, and stir
  in enough water to cover eels. Bring to a boil and add pieces of eel.
  Meanwhile with a mortar and pestle or in an electric blender crush
  garlic, almonds, parsley, and saffron with enough olive oil to make a
  smooth paste. Stir mixture into casserole, add salt to taste, and
  cook for about 20 minutes or until eels are done. Add more water if
  sauce thickens. Serve hot.
  
  Variation: For an all-in-one meal or a main course, add peas, chopped
  carrots, or new potatoes (or all three) and serve over rice, as they
  do in Valencia.

      Title: EFFORTLESS GRAVY WITH CRANBERRY SAUCE
 Categories: Butterball, Gravy
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
 
  The addition of store-bought whole-berry cranberry sauce to a basic
  recipe for turkey gravy ensures that first-time gravy makers will end
  up with a sauce that has both depth of flavor and color.
  
     3-1/2 tablespoons pan drippings from a roasted Butterball turkey
     3-1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
     1-1/4 cups broth made from the turkey giblets or canned chicken
  broth
     1/4 cup cream sherry or cranberry juice
     1/2 cup whole berry cranberry sauce
     Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
  
  1. Put the turkey drippings into a small saucepan and heat over medium
  heat. Add the flour, stirring continually with a whisk or wooden
  spoon; cook for 1 minute, taking care not to let the flour mixture
  brown. Slowly whisk in the giblet or chicken broth to make a smooth
  mixture. Whisk in the sherry or cranberry juice and continue to stir
  constantly until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens.
  
  2. Reduce heat to low and stir in the cranberry sauce until
  incorporated. Season the gravy to taste with salt and pepper. Keep
  warm over very low heat until ready to serve.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4    To 1/2 cup warm water
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 tb Sugar
  2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/3 c  Instant nonfat dry milk
    1/4 c  Cold butter or margarine,
           -cut into 4 pieces
      1 ts Salt
      2    Eggs, beaten
      1    Egg
           Sesame or poppy seeds,
           -optional
 
  Makes 1 loaf
  
  Combine 1/4 cup water, yeast and sugar.  Stir to dissolve yeast and
  let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.
  
  Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, dry milk, butter and
  salt into work bowl.  Process until mixed, about 15 seconds.
  
  Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
  seconds.
  
  Turn on processor and slowly drizzle the 2 beaten eggs through feed
  tube and just enough remaining water so dough forms a ball that
  cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl
  about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.
  
  Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
  make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
  dough turns around bowl about 15 times.
  
  Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Shape into ball and place in
  lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover with plastic
  wrap and let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down dough.  Divide into 3 equal parts.  Shape each part into a
  strand about 18 inches long.  Braid the strands loosely together.
  Tuck ends under and pinch to seal. Fit braid into greased 8 1/2 x 4
  1/2 x 2 1/2 inch loaf pan.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let
  stand in warm place until almost doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  Heat oven to 375 F.  Beat remaining egg with fork. Brush egg over
  braid. Sprinkle sesame or poppy seeds over braid, if desired. Bake
  until evenly browned, 25 ~ 30 minutes.
  
  Remove immediately from pan.  Cool on wire rack.
  
  REFRIGERATOR EGG BRAID:  Prepare dough through first rising and shape
  into braid as directed for Egg Braid. Place in greased loaf pan,
  brush with vegetable oil and cover tightly with plastic wrap.
  Refrigerate 4 to 24 hours.  Uncover and let stand at room temperature
  30 minutes. Bake as directed for Egg Braid.
  
  RAISIN BREAD:  Prepare dough as directed for Egg Braid. Turn dough
  onto lightly floured surface and knead 1/2 cup dark raisins into the
  dough. Continue as directed for Egg Braid, eliminating sesame or
  poppy seeds.

  I was hoping someone would ask. This recipe came from an enclave of
  Order of the Arrow Scouts here in Tenn. Crumble and brown the
  sausage. Add cream style corn. Add the dozen eggs. Stir this into
  bottom of the dutch oven. On a 12 inch oven place about 8 briquets on
  the bottom and 14 on top. Cook about 30 minutes. This is great for
  camping trips. You can bake your biscuits while the eggs are cooking
  and have it all come out together. Let's have a recipe from you now,

      Title: EGG CUSTARD
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Eggs
      1 tb Sugar
    3/4 pt Milk
           Little grated nutmeg
 
  1.  Beat the eggs with a fork, add the sugar and warmed milk. 2. The
  milk MUST NOT BOIL, otherwise it will curdle the eggs. 3. Pour into a
  greased pie dish or basin, grating the nutmeg on top.
  
  BAKED CUSTARD
  
  1.  Half fill a dish, slightly larger than the pie dish, with cold
  water. 2.  Stand the pie dish in this, then bake for about 1 1/4
  hours in the centre of a slow oven (275-300F Gas mark 1-2) until
  firm. Too geat a heat causes curdling and will spoil the custard.
  
  STEAMED CUSTARD
  
  1.  Put the basin into the steamer over very hot water, and cook
  steadily for about 1 1/4 hours.  The water must never boil, otherwise
  the custard will curdle. 2. Test with your fingers, if you can just
  bear it in the water the heat is just right. 3. Cool slightly, then
  you can turn out the custard.

      Title: EGG CUSTARD TARTS
 Categories: Chinese, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Tart Pastry:
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Lard
      1    Egg
      6 tb Sugar
      2 c  Sifted all purpose flour.
           Egg Custard Filling:
      2    Whole extra large eggs
      3    Extra large egg yolks
      1 c  Whole milk
    1/2 c  Half and half
      1 c  Sugar
 
  Cream the butter with lard. Add egg and sugar. Beat well. Add flour,
  1 cup at a time. The dough will be mealy. Work quickly with your
  hands to gather dough into a ball. Knead lightly so the mixture
  adheres. You may chill it at this point while making the filling.
  
  Egg Custard Filling: Be sure all the ingredients are at room
  temperature. Beat whole eggs at low speed with egg yolks well. Do not
  over beat, add sugar, then milk, then half and half. Let mixture rest
  10 - 15 minutes. Skim foam from mixture.
  
  Separate dough into 24 ball. Press each into 2 1/2 inch tart shell to
  an even layer across the bottom and all the way up the side. Fill
  shell with filling almost to the top. Preheat oven to 300. Place
  tarts on cooky sheet and bake for 45 minutes. Cool for 10 - 15
  minutes. Loosen slightly by inserting a toothpick along the sides.
  Tart shell should unmold easily.
  
  Rhoda Yee's comments: It is important that the ingredients for the
  filling be at room temperature and beaten over a bowl of warm water.
  Cold ingredients will cause filling to separate during baking. By
  skimming off the foam, the custard will have a golden, creamy
  appearance with a velvety smooth texture which is a most unique and
  delightful gastronomic treat! Do not bake at high heat, this will
  cause the custard to bubble up like a balloon and burst.

 Categories: Chinese, Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 qt Chicken broth, or clear soup
           -stock
      2 tb Cornstarch, mixed in 1/4 cup
           -cold water

           -fork
      2    Scallions, chopped,
           -including green ends.
 
  Here's one from Jim Lee's Chinese Cook Book (My favorite). He says
  that the secret of good soup is good soup stock. To keep the egg
  flakes afloat, the soup must be thickened with cornstarch first
  before the beaten eggs are stirred in. Bring soup stock to a boil.
  Slowly pour in the cornstarch mixture while stirring the stock, until
  the stock thickens. Reduce heat so stock just simmers.  Pour in the
  eggs slowly while stirring the soup. As soon as the last bit of egg
  is in, shut off heat at once. Serve with chopped scallions on top.
  SUBSTITUTIONS AND VARIATIONS: TOMATO EGG-DROP SOUP is just a
  variation of plain egg-drop soup. The added tartness of tomatoes
  gives this soup an extra "zing" and helps to pick up sagging
  appetites. The addition of 1 medium-size can of stewed tomatoes is
  all that is needed. Bring stock to a boil. Add the tomatoes. (Mash
  the tomatoes if the pieces are too large.) When soup boils again, add
  the cornstarch mixture as before. Add the eggs while stirring. Shut
  off heat at once and serve topped with the chopped scallions.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Hard Boiled Eggs
      2    Spring onions - or-
      1 tb Chopped Fresh Chives
      1 tb Lemon Juice
      1    Tin Concentrated Consomme
      6 tb Mayonnaise (not SALAD CREAM)
           Salt and Pepper
 
  Melt the consomme gently in a saucepan - do not bring it to the boil
  ~ then remove from the heat and add the lemon juice. As soon as it is
  cool, chill it in the fridge. Trim the spring onions or chop the
  chives and put them into a food processor or a liquidiser. Shell the
  eggs, cut them in half and add them to the food processor. Whiz for a
  few seconds, scrape down the sides, add the consomme mixture,
  mayonnaise and seasoning and process for a few more seconds until
  thoroughly blended. Do not over process - this is much nicer with a
  light texture. Pour it all into a souffle dish and allow to set in
  the fridge for at least two hours preferably four, to make sure the
  whole lot goes firm. It can even be left overnight in the fridge
  covered in cling film. This is nicest spooned out from the dish and
  eaten with granary bread or toast.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple appetizer for summer days -- This dish was served at a
  dinner I was invited to at the Vice-Chancellor's Lodge at the
  University of Liverpool when I was a student. Mrs. Whelan, the VC's
  wife, gave me the recipe later.
  
  *  A nice way to decorate is to peel some white grapes and chill. Then
  before serving spread thinly a little caviar on top and place halved
  grapes on top of that.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
  : Precision:  Measure gelatine and stock.

      Title: EGG NOODLES IN RICH HOISIN GRAVY
 Categories: Pasta, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 tb Hoisin sauce
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Asian sesame oil, divided
      2 tb Peanut or vegetable oil
      2 ea Large cloves garlic, minced
      1 tb Minced ginger
      1 lb Pork, boneless loin, minced
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
      2 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Chili oil or to taste
      1 lb Fresh Chinese egg noodles
      1 ds Salt
      2 ea Pickling cucumbers
      3 c  Chicken broth or stock
  1 1/2 c  Beans sprouts, blanched
 
  To prepare: pickling cucumbers, peel, seed, and cut into strips
  1/8-inch wide and 2-inches long. Mix cornstarch with 4 tablespoons
  stock or water. Cook's notes: The Chinese would use egg noodles, but
  you can substitute readily available Japanese ramen noodles. Hoisin
  sauce, Asian sesame oil and chili oil are available at Asian markets
  or supermarkets with large Asian specialty sections. Procedure: In a
  bowl, whisk together the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, half the sesame oil
  and the chicken stock. Heat the peanut oil in a wok and stir-fry the
  garlic and ginger for 45 seconds, or until soft. Add the pork and
  stir-fry until nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Add the rice wine and
  stir-fry for 30 seconds. Stir in the broth mixture and bring to a
  boil. Stir in the cornstarch mixture and return the entire mixture to
  a boil; it will thicken slightly. Add chili oil to taste and keep the
  gravy warm. Cook the noodles in boiling salted water about 1 minute,
  or until done to taste. Drain well and toss the noodles with the
  remaining sesame oil. Presentation: Divide the noodles among bowls,
  pour the gravy over them and garnish with bean sprouts and cucumber.

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 c  (about 1/2 lb) ground pork,
           Uncooked
      2 md Fresh mushrooms,
           Chopped fine
      2    Scallions, chopped fine
           (white parts separate from
           The green)
      2 ts Cornstarch, dissolved in
      2 tb Water, cold
    1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Peanut oil

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Plum sauce
           Dash hot chili oil or
           Tabasco
           Sauce
 
  In a bowl, stir the eggs with the dry sherry. In a mixing bowl,
  combine all the filling ingredients, include only the white parts of
  the chopped scallions (save the green parts for garnish) and stir to
  blend well. In a 8-inch skillet, heat the oil lightly.  Pour about a
  quarter of the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the skillet. Heat
  until the egg pancake has barely set, then transfer to a plate. Make
  3 more pancakes. Divide the filling into 4 portions and put a
  portions on each pancake. Moisten your fingers with cold water and
  spread the filling mixture evenly over the surface of the pancake,
  then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll. Seal with a little
  leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl. Place the rolls on a flat
  plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an inch of
  simmering water for 15 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the sauce
  ingredients.  To serve, cut the rolls into slices, cutting on the
  slant. Drizzle the sauce over them and top with the scallion greens
  and the carrots.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

      2 ts Salt
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Ice water
           Cornstarch
 
  Recipe by: The Cook's Book of Uncommon Recipes - ISBN 0-940367-14-9
  Sift flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the center and
  add eggs and water. Using a fork, stir the dough until it just holds
  together and leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a floured
  surface and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 mins or, if you
  prefer, use the dough hook on your mixer or food processor). Cover
  the dough and allow to rest for at least 30 mins.
  
  Divide the dough into 4 parts. Dust your pastry board lightly with
  cornstarch and roll each piece of dough out to an 11 x 14-inch
  rectangle. Cut the 14-inch length into 4 equal parts and the 11-inch
  length into 3 equal parts ( you will have 12 3 1/2-inch squares of
  dough). Stack on a plate (the cornstarch will prevent sticking).
  Repeat with the remaining 3 part of dough.
  
  If you are not going to use right away, wrap securely and freeze.

           -about 1 inch
      1    Clove garlic - large
      1 tb Sugar - PLUS 1-1/2 teaspoons
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      6    Med. shrimp - about 1/4
           -pound, shelled and deveined
      1    Head cabbage - green, tough
           -outer leaves removed (2 lb)
      1    Med. onion - cut into
           -1/4-inch dice
      2 lg Celery ribs - cut into
           -1/4-inch dice
     12    Egg roll wrappers
      1    Egg - beaten
      4 c  Peanut oil - for deep frying
      1 tb Dry mustard - mixed with 1
           -tablespoon cold water
 
  1.  Fill a large saucepan with water.  Add the ginger, garlic, sugar
  and salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the shrimp and cook
  until they curl and turn pink, about 1 minute. Discard the garlic and
  ginger and, using a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to a sieve to
  drain; let cool slightly, then cut in 1/4-inch dice. Set aside.
  
  2.  Bring the water in the saucepan back to a boil over high heat.
  Halve, core and finely chop the cabbage. You should have 6 cups. Add
  the cabbage, onion and celery to the water and cook until the cabbage
  is bright green, about 1-1/2 minutes.  Drain thoroughly in a colander
  and set aside to cool slightly.  Press down to extract any excess
  water from the vegetables.
  
  3.  In a large bowl, combine the reserved shrimp and the barbecued
  pork; season with salt to taste.  Add the vegetables and mix well.
  Divide the filling into
       12    equal portions.
  
  4.  Place an egg roll wrapper on a work surface like a diamond, with
  a tip facing you.  Keep the remaining wrappers covered. Place one
  portion of the filling in a horizontal line across the bottom third
  of the wrapper, then fold the tip closest to you over the filling
  toward the center. Lightly brush the side tips of the wrapper with
  some of the beaten egg, then fold them into the center.  Brush the
  surface with egg and roll up the wrapper from the bottom.  Brush the
  top tip with egg; fold toward you to seal the cylinder. Repeat with
  remaining wrappers and filling.
  
  5.  Heat a wok over high heat for 45 seconds.  Add the peanut oil and
  heat to 350F.  Add 4 egg rolls to the wok and fry, turning frequently
  with tongs or chopsticks, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
  Transfer to a colander or large sieve set over a bowl to drain.
  Repeat with the remaining egg rolls, 4 at a time. Serve immediately
  with the mustard sauce.
  
  Makes 12 egg rolls.
  
  This is truly a creation of the Chinese-American restaurant. There is
  no such thing as an egg roll in China. There are spring rolls,
  delicate finger-size cylinders filled with bean sprouts, scallions,
  shrimp and pork, encased in a paper-thin skin.  Egg rolls on the
  other hand are usually filled with a bewildering variety of
  ingredients, mostly chopped cabbage. It is, however, possible to
  create a fine egg roll such as the one here.

 Categories: Salads, Seafood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 oz Cooked lobster meat; diced,
      1    Hard-boiled egg; diced
      1 sm Avocado; (ripe) diced
      2    Shallots
      2    Lemons
      1 c  Mayonnaise; (homemade)

      1    Red ripe tomatoes
      6    Asparagus spears; peeled & c
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
      1. Mix the diced lobster meat, diced eggs and diced avocado
         (sprinkled with fresh lemon juice) and fine diced shallots with
         the mayonnaise, very gently. Use just enough mayonnaise to coat
         and bind. Season to taste with salt and red pepper. I like to
  use
         the Japanese Sashimi Togarashi.
  
      2. Spoon back into the lobster or avocado shell, and rest on a
  bed of
         shredded red romaine or curly lettuce. Garnish with lemon
  wedges
         and asparagus with reserved lobster claws on top.
  
     Serves 1 or 2
  
     April Fool! This is a thinly disguised Lobster Mayonnaise, with an
  egg
     and avocado salad, accompanied by a dish of Springtime asparagus.
  Have
     a sauceboat of the freshly made mayonnaise available. Serve with a
     crusty bread and a chilled Chablis for a Spring Luncheon. The
  Chablis
     is one reason I use mayonnaise instead of vinegar. In spooning the
     salad into the lobsters chest cavity, spoon it right on top of the
     tomalley (the green liver of the lobster). For those who like it,
  this
     makes a fine taste. For those who don't, suit yourself, chacon a

 Categories: Egg-free
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      1 ts Cornstarch
      3 tb Water
 
  Substitute 1 t cornstarch for each omitted egg, adding
        3 T  water for each t cornstarch.
  
  This was tried on several different brands of cake mix including one
  which called for 3 eggs.  There was a slight change of texture,
  depending on the brand used. (One was slightly dry and crumbly, and
  another was super moist and tender.)  When you need to substitute
  only one egg, there is no discernible change.
  
  Naturally, this will not work with chiffon, sponge or angel food cake
  when the whipped volume of the eggs is essential.

  This is a good way to introduce eggs to your baby (if the
  pediatrician says you are ready to).  Eggs contain all 22 of the
  amino acids-the building blocks of protein-that we need for new
  tissues, clotting of blood, and formation of antibodies.
  
  Cold water Mother's milk or formula
  
  Place egg in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil
  and simmer very gently for 15 minutes. Remove and immediately fill
  pan with running cold water. Let sit in cold water until shell is
  cool. Crack open, discard the white and mash the yellow yolk with a
  fork and add a few drops breast milk or formula. Go easy (small
  amounts of egg for baby) at first to see if any allergies develop.

MMMMM---------------------BRANDY CREAM SAUCE--------------------------
      1 c  Butter
  1 1/4 c  Flour
      5 c  Hot milk
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      2 oz Brandy
     16    Eggs
      3 qt Water
      3 c  White vinegar
 
  Authentic?  I sure as heck can't say.  Fattening++you bet! Good?
  More'n likely.  How could it help but be with a brandy cream sauce
  and crabmeat.
  
  Melt the butter in a saute pan or skillet over low heat. Add the crab
  meat and cook slowly, stirring very gently, just until hot, about 5
  to 8 minutes.
  
  To prepare the brandy cream sauce, melt the butter over low heat in a
  sauce pan.  Stir in the flour gradually, cook for about 3 minutes,
  then gradually pour in the milk, continue stirring.  Cook over low
  beat until the sauce thickens, then add the salt, pepper and brandy.
  Continue to cook about 5 minutes or until the sauce is medium thick.
  
  To poach the eggs, bring the water and the vinegar to a boil in a
  large skillet or saute pan.  Keeping the water at a continuous low
  rolling boil, crack the eggs one by one into it. Cook until the egg
  whites are firm, about 4 minutes.  Lift the poached eggs out of the
  water with a skimmer or slotted spoon, allowing the water to drain
  back into the pan. Place them on a heated platter while you assemble
  the dishes.
  
  Place 3 ounces of crab meat on each of 8 heated plates, then place 2
  poached eggs side by side on the crab meat. Ladle sauce evenly over
  the portions.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

  hours. Preheat oven to 450 F. In a small bowl combine the salsa
  ingredients. Cover and chill until ready to use. Sprinkle a little
  water on each tortilla and rub it into each tortilla with your
  fingers. Stack the tortillas, then wrap in foil.  Set aside. Spread
  the marinated tempeh and vegetables on a baking sheet in one layer.
  Bake 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender anfd tempeh
  begins to brown. So not toss while cooking. Place the tortilla packet
  in the oven for about 7 minutes. This will heat the tortillas with a
  little steam to soften them. To serve, place a tortilla on each
  plate. Spoon some of the tempeh mixture along the center, cover with
  a little cucumber salsa, then fold and roll to enclose the filling.

      Title: EGGLESS MAYO ("BETTER 'N HELLMAN'S")
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Edensoy (Original)
  2 2/3 c  Oil
      2 tb Cider Vinegar
      1 tb Maple Syrup (or sugar)
      1 ts Salt

MMMMM------------------------NOW TRY THIS-----------------------------
 
  Directions: Place soy milk in food processor (or blender). Put on
  lowest setting.  Drizzle oil into soy milk. Add other ingredients. I
  add about the same amount of lemon juice in addition to the vinegar.
  Someatimes I add one tablespoon of dry mustard. You've got to try
  adding basil and/or sage and/or oregeno.
  
  I've also never had a problem adding all the vinegar, syrup, salt,
  etc. to the soy milk first and then adding the oil.
  
  You cannot fail.  Try it.
  
  I got the basic recipe from Shirley Wilkes-Johnson. She is a gourmet
  cook and inventor.

      2 tb Sugar
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    3/4 c  Eggnog; at room temp.*
 
  I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for
  the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may
  need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
  it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
  dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
    * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
  microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your manufacturers'
  directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made
  a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I
  used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness
  button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a Welbilt). Let
  me know your results, we sure enjoyed it! FROM: LISA CRAWLEY (TSPN00B)

      4 tb Unsalted butter; melted
  1 3/4 c  Half-and-half
      3 tb Brandy
      2 tb Pure vanilla extract
    3/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/8 ts Salt
      6 sl Dry cinnamon raisin bread
           - quartered

MMMMM-------------------CRANBERRY-MAPLE SAUCE------------------------
    1/3 c  Pure maple syrup
      2 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Cranberries
           - if frozen, do not thaw
      3 tb Unsalted butter
  1 1/2 tb Bourbon
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F 15 minutes before baking, with the rack in the
  center of the oven. Butter a 6-cup souffle dish. Have a kettle of
  boiling water ready and a baking pan large enough to hold the souffle
  dish. Whisk the eggs, egg yolk and sugar until light. Mix in the
  butter, the half-and-half, brandy, vanilla, nutmeg and salt. Place
  the bread in the souffle dish and pour the custard over it. Press the
  bread into the custard so it gets well soaked. Let rest 20 minutes.
  Put the souffle dish in the baking pan and place on the oven rack.
  Pour boiling water into the baking pan so it comes halfway up the
  sides of the souffle dish. Bake until the custard is softly set in
  the center, about 1 hour. Remove from the water bath. Serve warm or
  at room temperature with Cranberry-Maple Sauce. Once cooled, the
  pudding can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. To reheat, cover with
  aluminum foil with several slits in it. Bake in a preheated 350F oven
  for 20 minutes. Serve warm, or at room temperature with
  Cranberry-Maple Sauce. CRANBERRY-MAPLE SAUCE: Bring the maple syrup
  and sugar to a boil in a small non-aluminum pan, then cook for 3
  minutes. Add the cranberries and cook until their skins burst and
  they begin to pop, 6 to 8 minutes, or slightly longer if they are
  frozen. Cut the butter into 3 pieces. Remove the pan from the heat
  and whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, waiting until each is
  incorporated before adding another. Add the bourbon. Sauce can be
  served immediately or refrigerated for up to a week. Reheat gently
  and thin with 2 to 3 tablespoons water before serving.

 Categories: Vegetables, Side, Dish
      Yield: 6 To 8
 
      2 md Eggplants (smooth skin)
      3 cl Garlic, mashed
      3    Eggs, beaten
  2 1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
    1/4 c  Matzo or bread crumbs
      2 tb Olive oil
           Salt and pepper, to taste
           Freshly-grated nutmeg
 
  Stem the eggplants and cut each into half, lengthwise. Cut each half
  crosswise, into 4 chunks.  In covered saucepan, simmer chunks in
  water to cover for 15 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. Then,
  separate pulp from skin, taking care not to tear skin. Reserve skin.*
  
  In a bowl, vigorously mash pulp with garlic.  Mix in remaining
  ingredients, except for 1/2 cup of the cheddar cheese and the nutmeg.
  Combine thoroughly. Add more matzo or bread crumbs, if mixture seems
  too thin.
  
  Mound skins with mixture,* place on well-oiled baking sheet. Sprinkle
  with a little of the reserved cheese and a bit of ground nutmeg. Bake
  in preheated 350 degree oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown on
  top.
  
  *or pile mixture on small, individual gratin dishes
  
  VARIATION:
  
  Makes a beautiful fritada by adding 8 oz. of cottage cheese to filling
  mixture.  Line a 9x13 glass dish OR a fritada pan with the skins,
  shiny side down. Spread mixture evenly over the skins. (You don't
  have to use the skins, if you wish.)  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2
  cup of grated cheddar, plus a light dusting of ground nutmeg. Bake in
  a preheated 350 degree oven for
        1    hour.
  
  Both variations excellent with Mediterranean meals, particularly

 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    4 inch (10cm) eggplants,
           Caps removed, and cut in
           Half lengthwise

MMMMM----------------------GINGER-SOY SAUCE---------------------------
    1/3 oz (10 gm; 1-inch cube) fresh
           Ginger, peeled and finely
           Grated
      1 tb Soy Sauce
 
  Bring about 4 cups water to a boil in a medium sized saucepan over
  high heat. Add Eggplant halves, cut side up, and reduce heat to
  medium. Simmer, uncovered, until just cooked (about five minutes)
  turning eggplant after about 3 minutes. Test by pricking with
  toothpick or skewer. Flesh should be soft but not mushy.
  
  Drain with skin side up., Press gently with your hand to squeeze out
  water without crushing. Cool.
  
  When cool, cut each half lengthwise into 1/8 inch slices [I make them
  thicker] The vegetable can be cut when hot, but the result is messy.
  
  Mix ginger soy sauce. [I do this first]
  
  Place eggplant slices on a serving plate, and pour sauce over. Can be
  eaten hot, at room temp. or chilled.
  
  The recipe calls for small oriental eggplants but if large ones are
  used cut them in half, and then cut each half into quarters before
  cooking.

      1 ts Nutmeg (or to taste)
           Salt and pepper to taste
    1/4 c  Each balsamic vinegar &
           White wine for sauteing
 
  Cut the eggplant into thick slices (can leave skin on, if desired)
  salted the slices, and let them drain for about half an hour or so.
  Pat them dry with a paper towel, then cut into bite-sized chunks.
  (The salting/draining helps keep the eggplant from getting bitter.)
  
  In a cup, mix equal parts of balsamic vinegar and white wine for
  sauteing. Add crushed garlic to this mixture, and use this to saute
  eggplant until it is nice and soft (15-20 minutes at medium heat).
  Remove eggplant, and saute mushrooms in remaining vinegar/wine
  mixture until they release their juices. Stir in eggplant, then add
  soup mix and water (or canned soup, if using that). Add paprika,
  nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, and cook 5-6 minutes until sauce
  has thickened and veggies are heated through. Add additional water if
  sauce is too thick, and do not overcook.
  
  Serve over rice or fetticine noodles. Makes plenty for 4-6 hungry
  people. Recipe can be halved.
  
  I got this soup recipe off this group, but unfortunately lost the
  name of the author. Its really wonderful! The only comment is that I
  use less water when making cream sauces than is suggested here.

      Title: EGGPLANT CREAM (TURKISH) HUNKAR BEGENDI
 Categories: Vegetables, Side dishes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 md Sized eggplant (batinjaan)
      6 tb Flour
      4 tb Butter
      1 tb Lemon juice
           Grated cheese
           Salt and pepper
 
  In Turkey this unusual eggplant dish is called Sultan's Pleasure, for
  reasons which are obvious as soon as one samples it. Particularly
  delicious with chicken. Grilling the eggplants gives the vegetables
  an agreeable smoky flavor.
  
  Grill eggplants whole without peeling them by holding over a flame and
  turning slowly, or prick skin in several places and set in hot oven.
  When the skin begins to break and the inside pulp feels soft, slip
  off the skin and scoop the pulp into a saucepan. Mix lemon juice with
  pulp and simmer until very soft, stirring often (10-15 minutes).
  Meanwhile, melt butter, add flour to it and allow flour to brown.
  Beat the butter and flour mixture into the eggplant. Slowly add
  several tablespoons of hot milk and continue beating until mixture
  resembles mashed potatoes. Lastly add several tablespoons of grated
  Parmesan or Cheddar cheese and cook several minutes more. Serve
  immediately. (From Food from the Arab World Marie Karam Khayat and

  the eggplant slices in a single layer, pressing them in place. Grind
  some pepper over them. Tear basil leaves into fragments and scatter
  over eggplant. Sprinkle lightly with half the remaining Parmesan and
  the spread over the tomato mixture. Arrange the remaining eggplant
  slices on top in a single layer, pressing firmly in place. If there
  are a few extra slices, press them on top. Pour over the cheese-egg
  mixture and smooth the top. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan. Put
  into the oven, reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake until the
  custard surface is swelled and golden with no depression in the
  middle, about 30 minutes.  Serve hot.

      Title: EGGPLANT DAL SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Indian, Digest
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 md Eggplant
    2/3 c  Red lentils
      2 c  Water
      2 ts Black mustard seeds
      1 ts Coriander
      1 ts Cumin
      1    Cinnamon stick
      1    Dried red chili
           -cayenne pepper to taste
           -salt to taste
 
  Roast the eggplant in a 400-degree oven for an hour (stab it first
  with a fork).  A half hour or twenty minutes before you anticipate
  the eggplant will be done, pop the mustard seeds in a medium sized
  saucepan, then add lentils, water and spices.  Bring to a boil and
  gently simmer until the eggplant is finished cooking, then remove
  eggplant from oven, slit open, scoop out innards, chop them coarsely
  and add to lentils. Cook another 5-10 minutes to blend all the
  flavors. This would probably make a respectable soup if it were
  thinned out with more water and broth, but I served it over...
  
  > Kirsten, your recipe for eggplant dal sounds delicious, but would
  you explain > how to "pop" mustard seeds? Also, you call for black
  mustard seed ~ how is > that different in flavor from regular mustard
  seed? Do you find them at your > HFS, or do normal grocery stores
  carry them? > I pop the seeds by putting them in a heavy wok with a
  lid. I spray a little bit of Pam first.  The brown or black mustard
  seeds can usually be gotten at a HFS or an Indian grocery store.
  These are the only kinds of seeds I have ever tasted so I can't
  comment on whether the flavor is different but they add substantially
  to the flavor of an Indian type dish.

      1    Green onion; chopped
    1/4 c  Parsley
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Dill weed
 
  Recipe by: McDougall Plan Cut the stem off the eggplant and prick it
  all over with a fork. Place directly on the oven rack in a 350 degree
  oven. Bake about 1 hour or until eggplant is soft and has wrinkled
  skin. Remove from oven and cool. When it is cool enough to handle,

  cauliflower, carrots, zucchini. Or use as a dip for whole wheat pita
  bread. If you add more water when blending, this makes an interesting
  salad dressing, Also good as a sandwich spread. From the collection

 Categories: Vegetables, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Japanese or round eggplants
           Oil for frying
      3 tb Virgin olive oil
      1    Red onion; finely chopped
      1    Garlic clove; finely chopped
    1/2 ts Herbes de Provence
  2 1/2 lb Ripe tomatoes
           - peeled, seeded and chopped
           Salt
           Pepper, freshly milled
           Sugar, if needed
    1/8 ts Saffron threads
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Ricotta cheese
    1/3 c  Milk or whipping cream
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
     10 lg Basil leaves; cut or torn
           - into small pieces
      3 oz Gruyere cheese
           - shredded or thinly sliced
 
  SLICE EGGPLANTS diagonally about 1/2-inch thick. Discard pieces that
  are all skin on one side. If using round eggplants, halve them
  lengthwise, then cut into 1/2 or 1/4 rounds, about 1/2-inch thick.
  Generously cover bottom of wide skillet with oil. When hot, add
  eggplant in single layer and fry until golden on both sides and flesh
  is tender. Drain on paper towels. Add more oil, if needed, and fry
  rest of eggplant. Make sure oil is hot each time you add a new batch.
  FOR SAUCE: Warm olive oil in skillet and add onion, garlic and herbs.
  Stir to coat onion with oil. Cook gently until onions soften, 12 to
  15 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, salt lightly and raise heat. Cook,
  stirring occasionally, until juice has evaporated and sauce is thick,
  about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If tomatoes
  are on the acid side, add sugar to taste to correct balance. FOR
  CUSTARD: Cover saffron threads with a few tablespoons hot water and
  let stand a few minutes. In bowl, beat eggs and stir in ricotta
  cheese, milk and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper, then
  stir in saffron with liquid. FOR GRATIN: Spread a little tomato sauce
  over bottom of baking dish, then arrange a layer of eggplant slices,
  slightly overlapping. Season with salt and pepper, scatter half the
  basil, add Gruyere. Make another basil-eggplant layer. Cover with
  rest of the tomato sauce. Pour custard over the top. Preheat oven to
  350F and bake 40 minutes or until custard sets and is a delicate
  golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to rest a few minutes before
  serving.

 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Eggplant
           Minced onion
           Peeled and diced tomatoes
           Minced garlic
           Cumin
           Cilantro
           Chili powder
           Salt
 
  Take the eggplant, prick it several times with a fork (this is very
  important!), place in a shallow baking pan and bake at 350 F. for an
  hour or so till it is cook through. Remove from oven and allow to
  cool. Peel and mash.  Add the remainder of the ingredients.
  
  Refrigerate mix for an hour or two before eating because it allows the
  flavors to blend and smooth out better. After the dip sits for a
  while some of the water from the tomatoes separates out and I just
  pour that off. One advantage eggplant has over avacados (aside from
  the FF aspect) is that eggplant keeps longer. Eggplant guacamole can
  be made ahead of time and it will keep for a couple of days in the
  refrigerator.

  1 1/2 ts Salt
  2 1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      6 oz Fresh mozzarella cheese,
           Sliced 1/8-inch thick
      1 cn (2 oz.) anchovy fillets
    1/4 c  Fresh basil leaves plus
           Several sprigs for garnish
      3    Eggs
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      3 c  Fresh Italian bread crumbs
           Marinara Sauce as
           Accompaniment (optional)
 
  1.  Layer the eggplant slices in a colander, sprinkling each layer
  with the salt.  Set aside to drain for at least 1 hour. Pat the
  eggplant dry with paper towels. 2. Preheat the oven to 375F. Using
  1/4 c. of the olive oil, brush both sides of each eggplant slice.
  Arrange the slices in a single layer on 2 large baking sheets. Bake
  for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once, until the eggplant is tender when
  pierced with a fork but still holds its shape. 3. Remove from the
  oven; season with eggplant with the pepper. Cover half the eggplant
  with mozzarella. Finely chop the anchovies and basil together;
  sprinkle over the cheese. Cover with the remaining eggplant slices to
  form sandwiches. 4. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with 2 teaspoons
  of water and 2 teaspoons of the olive oil. Coat the eggplant
  sandwiches with the flour, dusting off any excess. Dip into the
  beaten egg, then coat the sandwiches thoroughly with the bread
  crumbs, pressing gently to adhere. 5. In a large heavy skillet, heat
  the remaining oil over moderately high heat to 375F or until a small
  bread cube browns in about 1 minute.
   Fry the eggplant sandwiches in small batches until golden, 1 to 2
  minutes per side.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper
  towels. Arrange the sandwiches on a platter or plates and serve on
  their own or with Marinara Sauce, garnished with sprigs of fresh
  basil.
   (The eggplant sanndwiches can be assembled and fried early in the
  day.
   Set aside on a cookie sheet at room temperature and reheat in a 400F
  oven for about 5 minutes just before serving.)

 Categories: Italian, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lg Eggplant (about 2 lbs),
           Sliced lengthwise 1/4-inch
           Thick
      1 tb Salt
      2 c  Olive oil

      2 ts Minced garlic (3 medium
           Cloves)
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
  1 3/4 c  Grated mozzarella cheese
           (8 oz.)
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           Cheese (2 oz.)
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 c  Marinara Sauce
 
  1.  Layer the eggplant slices in a colander, sprinkling each layer
  with the salt.  Set aside to drain for at least 1-1/2 hours. Gently
  squeeze out the excess liquid.  Pat dry with paper towels. 2. In a
  large skillet, heat the olive oil over moderately high heat to 375F
  or until a small bread cube browns in about 1 minute. Add the
  eggplant slices in small batches and fry, turning once, until golden
  and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted
  spoon and drain on paper towels. 3. Preheat the oven to 375F.  In a
  medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, garlic, parsley, mozzarella
  and all but 2 Tablespoons of the Parmesan. Stir in the egg and season
  with salt and pepper. 4. Spoon 3/4 c. of the Marinara Sauce into a
  nonreactive 8-by-12-inch baking pan. Spread about 1 Tablespoon of the
  mozzarella mixture on each slice of eggplant, roll up and place seam
  side down in the pan. Spoon the remaining 1/4 c. Marinara Sauce over
  the eggplant rolls and sprinkle the reserved 2 Tablespoons Parmesan
  on top. (This dish can be prepared to this point several hours ahead
  and kept covered at room temperature.) Bake until the mixture bubbles
  and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes. Serve hot or at room
  temperature. These eggplant rolls are from Apulia, the region that
  forms the heel of the Italian boot.  They make a wonderful antipasto
  or a delicious luncheon dish.  Serve at room temperature to enjoy
  their fullest flavor.

  chives, garlic, green peppers, and mushrooms. Saute till soft (I
  sauted at fairly high heat for about 15-20 minutes stirring a lot. I
  like eggplant to be prettty).  When done add to the pasta along with
  the tomato sauce, oregano, salt, pepper and red wine. stir and heat
  gently (on low). This was actually fairly easy to make, the only time
  consuimg paret was peeling the eggplant and chopping veges.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Of eggplant
      4 c  Of sugar (2 pounds)
      4 c  Of water
      1 ts Ground nutmeg
  1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
           Juice of 2 large lemons
           Grated rind of 1/2 lemon
 
  Makes about 8 half-pints
  
  Wash, peel and dice the eggplant.  Barely cover with water in a
  preserving kettle and boil for about 10 minutes; drain and set aside.
  Make a syrup by combining the sugar, water, nutmeg and cinnamon and
  bringing them to a boil.  Add the eggplant.  Remove from heat, cover
  and allow to stand overnight.  The next day, remove the eggplant with
  a slotted spoon and boil the syrup for 20 minutes to thicken it.
  Return the eggplant to the kettle and boil for 30 to 40 minutes until
  the syrup sheets when dropped from a spoon (2 drops forming on the
  edge of the spoon, coming together and falling as 1 drop), or until a
  jelly thermometer reads 220 to 222 F. Stir in the lemon juice and
  grated rind. Ladle into hot, sterilized jars and seal.
  
  To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe
  the rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all
  particles of food, seeds or spices. While contents are hot, cover
  with a 1/8-inch layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add
  another layer of melted paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to
  seal completely.

  Eggplant is a favorite in Louisiana, where they fry it, smother it,
  devil it, bake it and stuff it.  This versatile recipe makes a
  delicious dip or spread.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Preheat oven to 375oF.  Trim the ends off the
  eggplant and cut the eggplant in half lengthwise. Place the halves on
  a greased baking sheet, cut side down. Bake for 35 minutes, or until
  tender, then cool and peel and dice.
  
  In a large bowl, mix the eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, green onions and
  parsley.  In a small bowl, stir together the remaining ingredients.
  Pour the marinade over the vegetables and mix well. Cover and let
  stand for several hours to blend flavors.  Serve at room temperature.
  Makes 1 quart.
  
  Note:  To microwave the eggplant instead of baking it, place the
  halves cut side down on a greased microwave-safe dish. Cook on high 5
  to 6 minutes, or until tender. From: The Tabasco Cookbook.  Typed by

  (about 1/2 in thick) on the smaller side. Pour Flavored Bread crumbs
  into a plate or into a dish for coating the eggplant patties. . Beat
  3 eggs for dipping into eggplant. Heat up oil in a large pan, enough
  to fry the eggplant. Dip eggplant into egg and coat it with egg
  thoroughly. Then coat it with bread crumbs. Put them on to a plate
  when finished till you have enough to fry in your frying pan. Place
  the eggplant in the frying pan if you think it is hot enough to fry
  properly. Keep it frying till both sides are brown. Make sure you
  flip eggplant over so all sides will brown. When finished frying a
  batch place fried patties onto a plate covered with a paper towel to
  absorb the oil. Pre heat the oven to 350~.

  square by 1 1/2 in deep disposable aluminum pan). Pour a little bit
  tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of the eggplant
  patties on top. Cover that with sauce and a little bit of mozzerella
  cheese. Place another layer on top of that, repeat. When done put
  sauce and a lot of cheese at the very top add parmesian cheese to the
  top if desired or available.
  
  Cover the top of pan with foil. Place in the oven for 45 minutes.
  Stick fork in middle to see if it is hot all the way through. If not
  hot enough cook another 10 minutes. Leave it cooking with the foil
  off the top for the last 10 minutes of the cooking.
  
  Let it settle before serving for about 5 minutes. This taste good or
  better reheated. Can be reheated in Microwaveable dish.

      Title: EGGPLANT ROMA
 Categories: Vegetables, Deal-a-meal, Sparkie
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 ts Olive oil
      1 lg Clove garlic, minced
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      2 c  Peeled, cubed eggplant
  1 1/2 c  Peeled, seeded, chopped
           Tomatoes
           Salt and pepper
  1 1/2 ts Balsamic vinegar
    1/4 c  Chopped, fresh basil or
           1-1/2 ts dried basil
      4 ts Toasted sesame seeds
 
   1.  In medium skillet, heat olive oil, and saute garlic and onion
  until
       onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
  
   2.  Stir in eggplant and tomato.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
  
   3.  Cover and cook over low heat until eggplant is tender, about 10
       minutes.
  
   4.  Stir in vinegar and basil.
  
   5.  Cook uncovered 5 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.
  
   6.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
  
   NOTE: 1 teaspoon sesame seeds = 15 calories (1 joker).
  
   If you can't find balsamic vinegar, (I hope you can because it is
  delicious), try malt vinegar or red wine vinegar, or natural rice
  vinegar.
    Be adventurous.  There are lots of vinegars out there.
  
   Know your vegetables.  Choose an eggplant that has a smooth, glossy
  surface.  Avoid an eggplant that is dull looking and/or soft.

    3/4 lb Ground Meat      See Note
    3/4 lb Chicken Strips   See Note
    1/2 lb Pork Cubed       See Note
 
  : NOTES: Onion, the type of onion will determine the sugar content of
  the sauce, taste at 1/2 hour to adjust sugar. Eggplant, peel and cut
  into 3/4 inch or so cubes. Wine, any dry wine will do, but Cabernet
  Sauvignon is now inexpensive and bold- "Vendange 1992 is what I use."
  : PRE-PREP: Mince onion, cube eggplant, smash and mince garlic, mince
  parsley, open cans of tomato and tomato paste, pour some wine for
  yourself. : METHOD: Heat oil till v hot, add onions and eggplant and
  stir often, the goal is to sweat nearly all of the fluid out of the
  vegetables. Add garlic, stir well and give the garlic a minute to
  blend. Add Tomatoes, stir well, add wine, and tomato paste, mix to
  blend, add parsley, oregano, and basil. Stir to blend well and simmer
  uncovered for about 15 minutes stirring often. Add option if desired,
  simmer for another 15 minutes. Taste and decide if the sauce needs
  some sugar, (sometimes the eggplant are a bit bitter and sugar is
  required). Add sugar if required and simmer for another 20 minutes or
  so. Add salt and stir well, taste the sauce and adjust seasoning at
  this point. MSN=add a dash of cayenne or other chili powder at the
  end and stir in to peak the flavors. : The total cooking time is 45
  minutes to an hour, of course any sauce will be better the second
  day. : OPTIONS: Sausage, Pierce and steam the sausage to cook through
  and to exude some of the fat from the sausage or brown it well and
  drain the fat. Ground Meat, brown any lean ground meat in a skillet
  and drain. Chicken Strips, or cubes, grill or brown skinned chicken
  strips, or use turkey or duck. Pork cubes, grill or lightly brown
  lean pork chunks. Some folks will not eat Possum or Beaver unless it
  is made into this fine sauce. ~--

MMMMM---------------------------STACKS--------------------------------
      2 sm Eggplants
      8 sl Onion; cut 1/2-in. thick
    1/2    Lemon; juice only
      8 sl Tomato; cut 1/2-in. thick
           Salt, black pepper
      2    Onions; thinly sliced
      1 tb Butter or margarine
      1 tb Oil
      2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  To make sauce, melt 2 tablespoons butter in small saucepan. Blend in
  flour and mustard. Stir in milk until smooth. Bring to boil, stirring
  constantly. Cook, stirring, until thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in
  cheese until melted. Season to taste with salt, white pepper and hot
  pepper sauce. Set aside.
  
  To make stacks, cut each eggplant crosswise into three or four
  1-inch-thick slices, including bottom and stem end. Trim bottom so it
  will stand level. Parboil eggplant and 1/2-inch onion slices in small
  amount of water to which lemon juice has been added. Cover and cook 5
  minutes. Turn eggplant slices at halfway point in cooking. Drain on
  paper towels. Place bottom eggplant slices side by side in
  9-inch-square baking dish. Top each with 1 parboiled onion slice and
  1 tomato slice and spoon over 1/4 cup cheese sauce. Season to taste
  with salt and pepper. Cover with next largest eggplant slice and
  repeat stacking with onion slices, tomato slices, cheese sauce and
  salt and black pepper to taste. Top each with its stem end. To hold
  layers in place, insert 2 or 3 long bamboo skewers lengthwise through
  each eggplant stack. Saute thinly sliced onions in 1 tablespoon
  butter and oil in large heavy skillet until transparent. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper. Spoon onions around eggplant in baking
  dish. Sprinkle with parsley. Bake at 350F 20 to 25 minutes or until
  vegetables are tender. If necessary, add small amount of water to pan
  to keep onions from scorching. Remove skewers and slice lengthwise
  into wedges to serve. Serve additional cheese sauce on side.

      4    Tomatoes, peeled, seeded and
  1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs, home made or p
      1 cn 7oz  tuna fish, canned;-opt
      6    Anchovy filets, finely chopp
      2 tb Capers, minced
           Parsley and basil (optional)
    1/2 c  Olives, finely minced
      5    Eggplants, very small or l l
 
  1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 2. Cut the eggplants in half
  lengthwise, if using the small ones and take out the flesh, being
  careful not to damage the skin.  Mince the pulp well and place in
  colander after sprinkling with coarse(sea or kosher) salt for 30
  minutes. Do the same with the eggplant shells and put them on a paper
  towel to drain. 3. Heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a large
  skillet. Add the well drained eggplant pulp and cook until lightly
  browned. 3. Add the tomatoes and cook the mixture over high heat
  until the liquid is evaporated. 4. Add the other ingredients (Note:I
  do not use the tuna fish or the olives if I'm making this as a side
  dish;but they would be necessary if this is to be a main dish
  entree.) Cook the mixture for 2 more minutes. Season with care as the
  anchovies and capers are quite strongly flavored. 5. Fill the
  eggplant halves with the mixture.  there will probably be leftover
  ingredients to be placed in another (covered) baking dish. Drizzle
  the leftover olive oil on top and bake for 1 hour.

      Title: EGGPLANT STUFFED WITH OYSTERS
 Categories: Creole, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lg Eggplants, split lengthwise
      2    Jars (10 ounces each)
           -oysters
      3 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 c  Finely diced onion
      2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 ts Herbes de Provence
    1/2 ts Creole seafood seasoning
      2 tb Dry white wine
           I cup fresh bread crumbs
      1 tb Minced chives
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan
 
  Creole-style seafood seasoning blends are sold in most markets; you
  can use a mixture of salt and red, white and black peppers.
  Chesapeake- style seasonings, such as Old Bay, are another option.
  
  Bake the eggplant halves in a 400F oven until just tender. Scrape out
  the pulp, leaving a shell about 1/2 inch thick attached to the skin.
  Discard any big clumps of seeds and chop the pulp coarsely. Drain the
  oysters, reserving the liquor.  Chop oysters into bite-sized pieces.
  
  Heat the oil in a skillet; add the onion and garlic and cook until the
  onion softens.  Add the herbs and seasoning mix, then stir in the
  oyster liquor and wine. Reduce slightly, then stir in the eggplant
  pulp, bread crumbs, oysters and chives.  Cook for 1 minute, then
  taste for seasoning and adjust to taste. Spread the mixture evenly in
  the eggplant shells and top with Parmesan.  Return to the oven and
  bake until nicely browned.

      Title: EGGPLANT STUFFING
 Categories: Ethnic, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 md Eggplants (1 lb ea.)
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/3 c  Chopped scallions
           -=OR=- Shallots
      1    Garlic clove; sliced (opt.)
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Chopped fresh fennel or dill
    1/2 ts Allspice; more if necessary
    1/4 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Tomato paste; MIXED WITH:
    1/2 c  Water
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
 
  Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise.  With a small knife, cut away
  the eggplant flesh from the skin without breaking the skin (if
  planning to stuff the shells, leave 1/4-inch of the flesh with the
  skin as a firm base) and set the shells aside.  Dice the eggplant
  flesh and push through the medium blade of a meat grinder as quickly
  as possible to avoid discoloration.  (Or the eggplant may be pureed
  in a blender or food processor.)
  
  Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the scallions and garlic. Add
  the parsley, fennel, allspice, wine, and the diluted tomato paste.
  Stir in the eggplant pulp, season with salt and pepper, and simmer
  for 20 minutes. Taste to adjust seasonings.  Add the bread crumbs to
  absorb excess liquid.
  
  Stuff the eggplant shells, if desired, and place in an oiled baking
  dish. Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 35 minutes. Serve warm - or
  particularly good - cold.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6    Chinese eggplants (about 1
           -1/2 pounds)
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Chicken stock
      5 tb Peanut or corn oil, or more

  1 1/2 tb Red wine vinegar
      1 tb Asian sesame oil
      1 tb Toasted sesame seeds, for
           -garnish
 
  Everyone loves this dish, even those who don't particularly like egg
  plant. The flavor virtually explodes with a lively combination of
  sweet, spicy, tart and savory followed by the refreshing crunch of
  fresh water chestnuts. Serve as a side dish or first course for
  Western menus.
  
  Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch wide by 2-inch long strips.
  
  Mix together soy sauce, sugar and chicken stock. Set aside.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wide, flat skillet. When hot, add
  half of the eggplant. Saute, stirring constantly until seared and
  wilted, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate. Cook remaining eggplant,
  adding more oil if needed. Transfer to plate. Set aside.
  
  Heat a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining 1
  tablespoon oil, the ginger, garlic and chile; cook gently but do not
  brown. Add water chestnuts and half of the green onions; stir-fry for
  5 seconds. Increase heat to high, add reserved soy sauce mixture and
  the eggplant. Toss quickly over high heat until the sauce is reduced
  and absorbed into eggplant, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold in vinegar and
  sesame oil. Remove to a serving dish. Top with remaining green onions
  and sesame seeds. Serve hot or cold.

      Title: EGGPLANT TOMATO TART
 Categories: Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Recipe tart dough
      4    Japanese eggplants
    1/3 c  Olive oil
           Salt
           Pepper
      3    Tomatoes
      2    Whole eggs
      1    Egg yolk
  1 1/2 c  Light cream or half-and-half
           Nutmeg
    1/2 c  Basil leaves, loosely packed
           -and thinly sliced
    1/2 c  Guyere or Provolone, grated
 
  PREPARE THE TART DOUGH. Partially prebake it and set it aside.
  Preheat the oven to 450F. Slice the eggplants into rounds or diagonal
  pieces about 3/8-inch thick. Coat a baking sheet with a film of oil;
  then lay down the eggplant slices. Brush the surface generously with
  plenty of oil so the eggplant will not dry out; excess oil can always
  be blotted up later with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper
  and bake in a 450F-to-500F oven until the eggplant slices are lightly
  browned and tender, but not completely soft, about 10 minutes each
  side--they will bake further in the tart. Bring a pan of water to a
  boil, plunge in the tomatoes to a count of 10, and immediately remove
  them to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking. When they have
  cooled, peel them, then slice off ends, pull out the pulp and seeds
  with your fingers, then slice them into rounds as thick as the
  eggplant. (If the tomatoes are large, then cut the slices in half.)
  Set the oven heat at 375F; beat the eggs and the egg yolk together
  then whisk in the light cream. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, several
  grindings of black pepper, a few scrapings of nutmeg, and the basil.
  Scatter the cheese over the surface of the partially baked crust.
  Loosely layer the eggplant and tomatoes over the cheese; then pour
  the custard over all. Bake the tart until the custard is set and the
  surface is golden--about 35-to-40 minutes. Let it cool at least 10
  minutes before serving. This tart would go nicely with a California
  pinot noir. Makes one 9-inch tart.

  fit in the pan, then repeat the process. Do not crowd the skillet.
  Turn the heat down if the eggplant is browning too quickly.
  
  5. Lightly oil an ovenproof baking pan. Overlap the eggplant, potato,
  tomato, and onion slices, leaving -inch of each uncovered. Repeat the
  layers until all the vegetable slices have been used.
  
  6. Add the remaining 1 tsp salt and the pepper to the remaining
  seasoned oil and brush the vegetables with this mixture. Place the
  thyme and basil in between the layered vegetables. Bake uncovered for

  1 1/2 c  Onions, finely chopped
      1    Clove garlic, finely minced
      1 lb Fresh mushrooms, chopped
      1    Juice of 1 lemon
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
      3 tb Parsley, finely chopped
    1/2 ts Dried Thyme
      2 tb Basil, finely chopped
    1/2 lb Boiled ham, finely chopped
     10 tb Fresh bread crumbs
      7 tb Parmesan cheese, grated
      3    Med. eggplants (2 1/2 lb)
           Flour
           Tomato Sauce *
      1 c  Peanut, veggie, or corn oil
 
  1.  Heat the butter and add the onions and garlic. Cook, stirring,
  until onions are wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, lemon
  juice, salt, pepper, parsley, thyme, and basil.  Cook over relatively
  high heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid has almost
  completely evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. 2. Add the ham and cook,
  stirring, about 4 minutes. Add 6 T bread crumbs and 3 T Parmesan
  cheese. 3. Trim off the ends and cut each eggplant into 1/2 inch
  slices. You should have about 16 slices. 4. Pour the flour into a
  baking dish and add salt and pepper to taste. Dredge the eggplant
  slices in the flour mixture on both sides, shaking off the excess. 5.
  Heat about 1/4 cup oil in a large heavy skillet and add as many
  eggplant slices as the skillet will hold. Cook until golden brown on
  one side, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, adding more oil, little by little. The
  point is to add as much oil as necessary but as little as possible.
  Turn the slices, cook until golden on that side, and drain on paper
  towels. Continue adding eggplant slices and oil as necessary until
  all the slices have been cooked on both sides.  The total cooking
  time for all slices should be about 15 minutes. 6. Select a
  rectangular, square, or oval baking dish. (A No. 6 Pyrex glass dish
  that measures 11 3/4 X 7 1/2 X 1 3/4 inches works well.) Arrange the
  smaller slices of eggplant, sides touching, on the bottom of the
  dish.  Spoon the filling in the center, spreading it out but not
  quite to the edges and mounding it in the center. Cover with the
  remaining eggplant slices, overlapping as necessary. 7. Blend the
  remaining bread crumbs and cheese and sprinkle over all. 8. When
  ready to cook, preheat oven to 400 degrees. 9. Place the dish in the
  oven and bake 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove the dish and pour off the fat
  that will have accumulated on top and around the edges. Let cool
  slightly. 10. Serve with tomato sauce.
  
  *  Tomato sauce:
  
  2 T butter, 1 1/2 T finely chopped onion, 1/2 t finely minced garlic,
  2 c canned tomatoes that have been blended or sieved, 1/4 bay leaf,
  salt to taste, pepper to taste.
  
  Melt 1 T butter in a saucepan and add the onion and garlic, stirring.
  When the onion is wilted, add the tomatoes, bay leaf, salt, and
  pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
  
  Swirl in the remaining 1 T butter and serve hot.

      1    Large eggplant
      4 tb Vegetable oil
      3    Large onions, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, crushed
      1 tb Freshly grated ginger

      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Ogurt
    1/2 ts Sugar
 
  This is a fairly simple Eggplant dish made with yogurt. If you aren't
  crazy about eggplant, you can adapt this to use zucchini or other
  squash; just watch the cooking times! Roast the eggplant in a 350F
  oven for 1 hour or until tender. When cool, peel and cut into cubes.
  Brown the onion in 2 Tbsp of the oil. Add ginger, garlic, coriander,
  cayenne, turmeric, cumin and salt. Fry for several minutes. Add the
  remaining 2 tbsp oil and the eggplant cubes. Cook about 5 minutes.
  Just before serving, stir in the yogurt and sugar. Serve with (but
  not necessarily ON) basmati rice.

           Or drained chopped canned it
           -alian plum tomatoes
           Minced fresh basil
 
  FOR FILLING:     Peel eggplant and slice 1/2-inch thick. Salt
  generously on both sides.  Drain on paper towels 45 minutes. Pat dry
  with paper towels. Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes. Heat oil in
  heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic and saute
  until soft, about 5 minutes. Add eggplant and saute until beginning
  to turn golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Stir in wine, parsley and
  basil, scraping up browned bits. Cover and cook until eggplant is
  tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to
  processor or blender and puree until smooth. Cool completely. FOR
  PASTA: Combine flour, eggs and salt in processor and mix well.
   With machine running, add just enough water through feed tube to form
  ball.  Remove from processor.  Cover dough and let rest for 30
  minutes. (Pasta dough can also be made by hand.) Cut dough into 4
  pieces. Flatten 1 piece (keep remainder covered), then fold in
  thirds. Turn pasta machine to widest setting and run dough through
  several times until smooth and velvety, folding before each run and
  dusting with flour if sticky. Adjust machine to next narrower
  setting. Run dough through machine without folding. Repeat, narrowing
  rollers after each run, until pasta is 1/16 to 1/8-inch thick,
  dusting with flour as necessary. Line baking sheets with towels.  Set
  sheet of dough on work surface. Place about 1-1/2 teaspoons filling
  at 2-inch intervals along sheet. Roll second piece of dough. Set atop
  first sheet. Press down around filling to force out air and seal
  dough.  Cut into 2-inch squares. Arrange on prepared sheets. Repeat
  with remaining dough and filling.  Cover with towel. FOR SAUCE:
  Combine Madeira, wine and shallots in heavy small saucepan. Boil
  until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 4 minutes. Add cream and peel and
  boil 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in tomatoes.
   Season with salt and pepper.
      Cook ravioli in large pot of boiling water until just tender but
  still firm to bite, about 4 minutes for fresh. Remove with slotted
  spoon; drain. Divide among plates. Spoon sauce over. Garnish with
  basil. Serve immediately. Serves 6. DO AHEAD HINTS: * Ravioli can be
  prepared one day ahead and refrigerated or one month ahead, wrapped
  tightly and frozen. Do not thaw before cooking. * Sauce can be
  prepared one day ahead; refrigerate. EVEN EASIER: * Purchase sheets
  of fresh pasta for the ravioli or buy prepared ravioli to serve with
  the tomato cream sauce here. Recipe from Bon Appetit, September, 1987.

  Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes.
  
  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and
  garlic and saute until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add eggplant and saute
  until beginning to turn golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Stir in
  wine, parsley and basil, scraping up browned bits.  Cover and cook
  until eggplant is tender, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and
  pepper. Transfer to processor or blender and puree until smooth. Cool
  completely.
  
  FOR PASTA:
  
  Combine flour, eggs and salt in processor and mix well.  With machine
  running, add just enough water through feed tube to form ball. Remove
  from processor.  Cover dough and let rest for 30 minutes. (Pasta
  dough can also be made by hand.)
  
  Cut dough into 4 pieces.  Flatten 1 piece (keep remainder covered),
  then fold in thirds.  Turn pasta machine to widest setting and run
  dough through several times until smooth and velvety, folding before
  each run and dusting with flour if sticky.  Adjust machine to next
  narrower setting. Run dough through machine without folding. Repeat,
  narrowing rollers after each run, until pasta is 1/16 to 1/8-inch
  thick, dusting with flour as necessary.
  
  Line baking sheets with towels.  Set sheet of dough on work surface.
  Place about 1-1/2 teaspoons filling at 2-inch intervals along sheet.
  Roll second piece of dough.  Set atop first sheet. Press down around
  filling to force out air and seal dough.  Cut into 2-inch squares.
  Arrange on prepared sheets.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
  Cover with towel.
  
  FOR SAUCE:
  
  Combine Madeira, wine and shallots in heavy small saucepan.  Boil
  until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 4 minutes.  Add cream and peel and
  boil 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in tomatoes.  Season
  with salt and pepper.
  
  Cook ravioli in large pot of boiling water until just tender but
  still firm to bite, about 4 minutes for fresh.  Remove with slotted
  spoon; drain. Divide among plates.  Spoon sauce over.  Garnish with
  basil. Serve immediately.
  
  DO AHEAD HINTS: * Ravioli can be prepared one day ahead and
  refrigerated or one
    month ahead, wrapped tightly and frozen.  Do not thaw before
    cooking. * Sauce can be prepared one day ahead; refrigerate.
  
  EVEN EASIER: * Purchase sheets of fresh pasta for the ravioli or buy
  prepared
    ravioli to serve with the tomato cream sauce here.

  :          chopped
        2 TB capers -- drained, rinsed
        1 TB parsley, chives and basil
  :          (each) -- chopped
        3 lg red or yellow bell peppers
        8 oz fresh goat cheese -- beaten
  :          with
        2 TB buttermilk
      1/2 c  pine nuts (toasted) --
  :          coarsely chopped
  :          Basil oil (recipe follows)
  :          Garnish--
  :          Fresh herb salad and reduced
  :          balsamic vine
  
  Slice eggplant lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices and brush generously
  with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and arrange in one layer
  on baking sheets and broil in batches about 4 inches from heat until
  eggplant is golden and tender. Transfer with a spatula to paper
  towels and allow to drain.
  
  Combine the olives, capers and herbs in a bowl and set aside. Char the
  peppers and remove the charred skin with the point of a knife.
  Discard the stems and seeds and cut peppers lengthwise into wide
  strips.
  
  Line a small 4-cup loaf pan or terrine with plastic wrap, leaving a 3
  to 4-inch overhang. Arrange the eggplant, olive mixture, peppers,
  goat cheese and pine nuts in several layers, beginning and ending
  with the eggplant. Cover the eggplant with the plastic overhang and
  weight the terrine with a 4 - 5 pound weight, such as another loaf
  pan filled with canned goods, and chill in the refrigerator for 12 to
  24 hours.
  
  To unmold, remove the weights and invert the terrine onto a cutting
  board. Remove the pan and the plastic wrap and carefully cut slices
  with a serrated or electric knife. Place slices on chilled plates,
  and garnish with a small fresh herb salad, drizzles of basil oil and
  reduced balsamic vinegar.
  
  Yield: 4-6 servings
  
  BASIL OIL
  
  2 cups lightly packed herbs, large stems removed 1-2 cups olive oil
  Salt and pepper to taste
  
  Blanch the herbs in lightly salted, boiling water until they turn a
  bright green (about 5 seconds). Drain and plunge immediately into ice
  water to stop the cooking process and set the color. Blanching
  inactivates the enzymes that cause herbs to turn brown develop an
  oxidized flavor.
  
  Pat the herbs dry and add to a blender or food processor along with
  enough olive oil to cover. Blend briefly to make a thick paste. Pour
  into a clean tall jar and add enough oil to cover the puree by 2
  inches. Stir well or shake and store covered in the refrigerator for
  at least one day or up to 3 or 4 days depending on the color and
  flavor desired. Strain the oil carefully through a fine filter or
  cheesecloth. The oil should be very bright green and fragrant. Season
  with salt and pepper if desired and store covered in the refrigerator
  for up to 3 weeks.

 Categories: Entrees
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lg Eggs
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 lb Mushrooms (fresh),
           -sliced
      2 tb Flour
    1/2 c  White cooking wine
    1/2 c  Chicken broth
      3 tb Mayonnaise
      1 sm Onion, chopped
    1/2 ts Parsley, dried
           Salt and pepper
           -(to taste)
      2 tb Butter, melted
    3/4 c  Monterey Jack
           -cheese, grated
 
  Saute mushrooms in about 2 tablespoons butter.  Stir in flour. Blend
  well. Add wine, broth, mayonnaise, onion, parsley, salt and pepper.
  Cook, stirring until sauce is smooth.
  
  Pour sauce in shallow baking dish.  Break eggs over sauce, taking
  care not to break the yolk (it makes serving easier if the eggs are
  distributed symmetrically in the dish.) Pour about 2 tablespoons
  melted butter over eggs. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F.
  until eggs are cooked to your liking. (I like the yolks hard, so I
  bake for about 20 minutes.)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Eggs poached in mushroom sauce -- I got this recipe off the side
  of a bottle of cooking wine (which I had purchased for another
  recipe). It turned out to be so good that I used up the rest of the
  bottle in repeat performances.
  
  *  If you use ordinary white wine instead of cooking wine, add about
  1/2 teaspoon of salt to it.
  
  *  You can use any mild cheddar cheese in place of the Monterey Jack.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10-20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lg Round red peppers
      8    Eggs
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Tomato sauce
 
  1. Select well-shaped peppers that will sit upright. Halve them
  crosswise and remove seeds.  Trim stems but do not make a hole. 2.
  Parboil peppers in simmering, salted water until just tender, then
  drain peppers. 3. Break eggs 2 eggs into each pepper half.  Season
  and top with a 1/2 tablespoon slice of butter.  Place peppers in
  small baking pan, pour in 1 inch of hot poaching water, and bake
  briefly at 375 degrees until eggs set. 4. Ribbon with tomato sauce.
  
  My suggestions.  Try a spice such as Szechuan Style Pepper or Herb
  Pepper Blend instead of the salt and pepper. (Szechuan is copied from
  the label of a McCormick spice jar. Spell checker suggests the
  spelling Szechwan.)
  
  This also could be cooked at a low at a medium setting in a microwave

      1 ts Salt
      8    Fresh eggs
      4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted
           -butter, softened
  1 1/2 c  Cooked crab meat,  fresh or
           -canned
      4    English muffins
           Paprika (optional)
      4    Thin slices orange, cut In
           -half (optional)

MMMMM------------------ORANGE HOLLANDAISE SAUCE-----------------------
    1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
           -cut into pieces
      4    Egg yolks
      1 tb Orange juice
      1 ts Grated orange zest
    1/2 ts Grated lemon zest
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Dry mustard
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  Prepare the Hollandaise sauce, and keep it warm.  Mix the water with
  the vinegar (which will help the egg whites set quickly) and put it
  with the salt in a wide, shallow saucepan. Bring water to boil, then
  reduce heat to gentle simmer.  One at a time, break each egg into a
  separate small dish or bowl; then, holding the bowl very near the
  surface of the water, gently slip in the egg.  Add more eggs to the
  pan, taking care not to crowd them.
  
  Continue simmering until whites are firmly set and yolks are covered
  with slightly opaque film, about 3 minutes. Then use a slotted spoon
  carefully to remove each egg to a folded kitchen towel to drain. With
  small kitchen knife, carefully trim any ragged edges from whites.
  
  While the eggs are poaching, melt half the butter in large skillet
  over moderate to low heat, and saute the crab meat until heated
  through.
  
  Split and toast the English muffins and spread their cut sides with
  remaining butter.  Place two muffin halves on each serving plate. Top
  each half with some crab meat and then a poached egg. Spoon or pour
  enough Hollandaise over each egg to cover it and spread down the side
  of the muffin onto the plate.  If you wish, garnish with a dusting of
  paprika and half an orange slice.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
  
  ORANGE HOLLANDAISE SAUCE:
  
  In a small saucepan, melt butter over low heat until it's all liquid.
  place remaining ingredients in a food processor or blender and
  process until smoothly blended. With the machine running, pour in the
  melted butter in a slow, steady stream until it is completely mixed
  in and the sauce is thick. transfer sauce to small metal or glass
  bowl, and set it inside a larger bowl or 1)an of hot water to keep it
  warm.
  
  Makes about 1 1/4 cups.

        1 TB chopped garlic
        6 c  fresh spinach leaves, --
  :          stemmed and rinsed
        1 c  homemade or prepared

      1/2 ts Tabasco
  :          Salt and white pepper
        1 TB white vinegar
        2    eggs
  :          Hollandaise sauce, for
  :          serving -- (see recipe)
  
  Prepare artichoke bottoms: In a large, nonreactive pot whisk flour
  with a little water to make a smooth paste; whisk in about 1 quart of
  water and add salt. Squeeze juice from lemon half into water, then
  add peel. Bring to a boil, simmer 5 minutes and add artichoke
  bottoms. Cover, reduce heat to simmering and cook until artichokes
  are tender, and base can be pierced with tip of a knife, 25 to 30
  minutes. Let artichokes cool in their liquid. When artichokes are
  cool enough to handle, use a small spoon to scoop out chokes. Use a
  sharp knife to trim any remaining leaves.
  
  Prepare creamed spinach: In a skillet heat oil with onion and garlic
  over medium heat until tender. Add spinach in handfuls, stirring
  until it reduces and releases its liquids. Cook until liquid
  evaporates, 2 minutes. Fold in warm bJchamel sauce and season to
  taste with Tabasco, salt and pepper. Keep warm.
  
  Poach eggs: In a shallow saucepan or skillet bring 2 inches cold
  water and vinegar to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat until water
  simmers gently. Break eggs, one at a time, into a ramekin or coffee
  cup; holding ramekin as close as possible to water, gently slip egg
  into water. Poach eggs 3 minutes for very soft-cooked, 5 minutes for
  medium-soft. Using a slotted spoon, scoop out eggs and if necessary,
  gently pat dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  To assemble: Make a bed of spinach on 2 warmed plates and top with
  artichoke cups. Spoon a little Hollandaise sauce into cups and top
  with poached eggs. Spoon remaining sauce over eggs and serve
  immediately. Yield: 2 serving

      Title: EGGS SOUBISE
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Brunch, Breakfast
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4    Eggs, lightly poached
    300 ml Soubise sauce (see below)
           Triangles of fried bread

MMMMM-----------------------SOUBISE SAUCE----------------------------
     50 g  Rice; washed
    450 ml Vegetable stock
    175 g  Onions; sliced finely
     25 g  Butter or margarine
           Cream or yogurt to finish
           --(optional)
           Salt and pepper
 
  This recipe for soubise sauce comes from a French chef who bases it
  on a classic method. The addition of rice to the sauce gives it bulk
  and a satisfying baseline, perfect for lightly poached eggs. Served
  with triangles of fried bread this dish makes an excellent supper.
  
  To make the soubise sauce, start by cooking the rice for 5 minutes in
  salted boiling water. Drain. Heat the stock to boiling-point, and put
  in the onions and the rice. Simmer for 30 minutes until well reduced,
  stirring from time to time. Add the butter or margarine, pure in the
  blender, reheat, then thin out with a little cream or yogurt. Check
  the seasoning and serve hot.
  
  Place each poached egg in a warm ramekin dish and spoon some soubise
  sauce over them. Surround with crisp, golden triangles of fried bread
  and serve immediately.

      2 c  Heavy Whipping Cream
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla Extract
    1/2 ts Cinnamon; Ground
 
  Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and cloves together; set
  aside. Combine chocolate and coffee in small saucepan. Cook over low
  heat until the chocolate is melted, stirring constantly. Remove from
  heat and cool to room temperature.  Cream the butter and sugar
  together in a mixing bowl, until they are light and fluffy. Use an
  electric mixer set on medium speed. Add eggs, one at a time, beating
  well after each addition. Beat in vanilla and chocolate mixture. Add
  dry ingredients alternately with milk to the creamed mixture, beating
  well after each addition. Pour batter into 2 greased and waxed
  paper-lined 8-inch cake pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven
  for 30 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in pans on racks for 10
  minutes.  Remove from pans; cool completely on racks. To assemble the
  cake, place one cake layer on serving plate. Spread with Cinnamon
  Whipped Cream. Top with second cake layer. Frost sides and top with
  remaining Cinnamon Whipped Cream. Refrigerate until serving time.
  CINNAMON WHIPPED CREAM: Chill large mixing bowl and beaters. Combine
  cream, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon and beat with an electric mixer
  set at high speed until soft peaks form and mixture is thick enough
  to spread. DO NOT overbeat or you will have butter instead of whipped
  cream. NOTE: The original recipe came from a GI who found it in Egypt
  when he was stationed there.  Hence the name. The whipped cream
  frosting was added later but really adds to the recipe.

    3/4 ts Salt
  4 1/2 ts Olive oil
      1 lg Onion; chopped
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 tb Cumin, ground
    1/2 c  Rice
      5 c  ;Water, to 6 cups
 
  Place the olive oil (all of it) into the bottom of the crock pot.
  Turn the pot onto the highest setting (if variable available) and add
  the onions. Allow the onions 10-15 minutes to warm in the oil.  Add
  the remaining ingredients, including the water. If cooking the dish
  all day (i.e., a morning start), reduce heat to low; otherwise leave
  on high setting. Cover. Leave to simmer.
  
  Come home to a wonderful smelling house.  Stir the dish while in the
  crock. If it is dry, add a little water.  If it's soup-like, remove
  lid for a little while, or turn heat to high setting. Serve. It's
  tasty as a main mean or as a pilaf to accompany other meals.
  
  I got the basic recipe from Martha's book "Mediterranean Light"--p.

  It's one of my all time faves. And I used to think I hated lentils!

           Stephen Ceideburg
      6    Pontiac potatoes
      1 sm Onion
      1    To 2 tablespoons margarine
 
  Boil the potatoes in their jackets until just tender. Cool and store
  in the fridge to firm up for at least one day, prefer- ably two. When
  ready to use, grate potato coarsely, finely chop the onion, mix
  together and season to taste. (Ruth says you can also add chopped
  bacon, to make speck rosti, though this is usually a breakfast dish.)
  
  Heat the margarine in a frying pan and add potato mixture. Do not
  press it down; keep it loose and light. Cook it for 10-15 minutes on
  medium heat, turning it in sections a couple of times. Towards the
  end, leave it to form a golden brown crust on the bottom. Turnout,
  crust upwards, onto a platter and serve.

  Gradually add enough water to obtain a viscous batter. Cook the
  batter in the skillet until the top is done. The bottom will form a
  crust, the so-called 'Schuepet'. In a separate skillet, brown the
  onion in the remaining clarified butter. Pour the onion and fat over
  the 'Saebrei'. This used to be served with a glass of milk.

  poaching chicken. 3. Place the broiled fish or poached chicken on
  serving plates and place about 1/4 of the sauce on each plate. Serve

  puree. Drain, if necessary, and store in a tightly closed glass jar
  in the refrigerator.
  
  At weddings, showers, saint's days celebrations and other special
  occasions a hostess was sure to serve small tortillas or gorditas
  (which are fatter, or mas gorda, than tortillas), one filled with
  beans, the other with BARBACOA, along with shredded cappage, dressed
  with vinegar and oil, and a salsa of some kind. Often nacatamales
  (cocktail size tamales), perhaps filled with chicken, potato, raisins
  and olives, would make up part of the plate offered. And no party was
  complete without at least one verse of "Las Mananitas", the Mother's
  Day song, or bizcochuelos, buttery cookies shaped like wreaths and
  with the unforgettable flavor of anise.
  
  In an 8-quart stock pot, bring water to the boil, add meat, garlic
  puree, spice pouch and salt. Bring to the boil again, skim scum,
  reduce heat and simmer 1 hour, or until the meat is tender,
  frequently removing scum. Remove meat and cool enough to handle.
  Discard spice pouch; reserve liquid. With fingers, shred the meat
  finely.
  
  In a large skillet, heat oil and saute green chile, onion, garlic
  puree, vinegar, broth and jalapeno. Add bay leaf. Add shredded meat
  and the rest of the ingredients. Simmer until flavors blend, about 10
  minutes.
  
  Place seasoned meat in a large, shallow baking pan and bake at 300
  degrees for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

  Chalupas, Enchiladas and Tamales.
  
  Cut meat into 1-inch pieces and place, a handful at a time, into a
  paper bag containing flour, salt and pepper. Shake well. Repeat with
  remaining beef.

  garlic and oregano. Cook over low heat 1 hour or longer, until meat is
  tender, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. Add a little hot
  water if necessary.

      Title: EL CHARRO SALSA DE CHILE COLORADO (BASIC RED
 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12    Dried red chiles
      2 qt Water -- boiling
      3 tb Oil
    1/4 c  Garlic puree -- *
    1/2 ts Salt -- or to taste
      3 tb Flour
 
  * Garlic Puree - peel 8 whole heads of garlic by smashing the cloves
  with the side of a wide knife; the peel will slip off easily then.
  Put the peeled garlic in a blender with about 2 cups of water, and
  puree. Drain, if necessary, and store in a tightly closed glass jar
  in the refrigerator.
  
  Salsa De Chile Colorado is used in countless Mexican dishes. It is
  available canned and is usually called enchilada sauce. But nothing
  commercial is as good as the sauce you make yourself from dried red
  chile peppers.
  
  To prepare a sauce, the peppers are softened in boiling water, then
  ground into a rich red paste. The paste is thinned with the cooking
  liquid for use as a sauce for enchiladas, et cetera. Left unthinned
  and spiced with oregano and vinegar it becomes adobada and is used as
  a marinade for carne (beef) adobada or puerco (pork) adobada.
  
  Wash chiles in cold water and remove stems. Cook in boiling water
  until tender. Remove chiles and reserve the cooking liquid.
  
  Place a few of the chiles in a blender, along with 1/2 cup resreved
  liquid, and blend to a paste. Remove to bowl. Repeat with remaining
  chiles. (It is now unseasoned red chile paste).
  
  Heat oil in a large skillet. Add garlic puree and flour, stirring
  until four browns. Add the chile paste, stirring constantly until it
  boils and thickens. Season with salt. Thin slightly with cooking
  liquid.
  
  Yield: 2 quarts
