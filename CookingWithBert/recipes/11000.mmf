           Deep-fried Artichokes,
           Jewish Style

MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
      4 sm Artichokes
    1/2    Lemon
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Plain bread crumbs, spread
           -over aluminum foil
           Vegetable oil; for frying
 
  Cut off half of each artichoke stems.  Remove and discard all outer
  green leaves until you reach the white central cone. At this point,
  you will see that three-quarters of the leaves are white and the tip
  of the cone is pale green.  Slice off the green top.
  
  With a small knife, trim off the outer green part of each artichoke's
  green bottom.
  
  Gently open each artichoke with your hands and remove the fuzzy choke
  with a spoon or melon scooper.  Rub the lemon over the cut edges of
  the artichokes and season them inside with salt and pepper. Gently
  open the artichoke leaves as far as they can go without breaking them
  off, and holding the artichokes by their stems, press the open leaves
  into the gread crumbs to coat lightly.
  
  Heat two inches of oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat to
  250F to 257F.  Lower the artichokes into the oil and cook about 10
  minutes. Turn the artichokes a few times to they will fry evenly.
  Lower the heat if the artichokes turn golden too fast.  With a thin
  knife, prick thier bottoms to test for doneness. They are done when
  they can be easily pierced. Transfer the artichokes to peper towels
  to drain. (The artichokes can be prepared up to this point severl
  hours ahead.)
  
  Just before you are ready to serve them, pour two inches of oil in
  another medium-size sacuepan over medium-high heat. When the oil is
  very hot, but not smoking, about 375F, carefully add one artichoke.
  With two long wooden spoons, or a long tong, hold the artichoke
  open-face down, pressing the leaves gently against the bottom of the
  pan to open them further. Hold the artichoke in that position for
  about 30 seconds. Transfer the artichoke to peper towels to drain.
  Repeat with the other artichokes. The second frying should take no
  longer than 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle them lightly with salt and serve
  hot.

           Fresh ground black pepper
           Extra virgin olive oil

  Snap off the artichoke stems, remove any tough or blemished petals,
  then snip off prickly tips. Place artichokes in boiling water with
  lemon juice and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove, pat dry and
  sprinkle insides with salt. Set artichokes stem-down in a deep
  stainless-steel kettle just large enough to hold them snugly. Add
  enough oil to reach halfway up the artichokes. Bake uncovered in an
  oven preheated to 200C(400F) for 10 to 20 minutes (time depends upon
  the qualify of the artichokes). When cooked, discard most of the oil

           Baked Artichokes Roman Style

MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
      4 sm Artichokes
    1/2    Lemon
      3    Fresh bread slices, crusts
           -removed, finely chopped
    1/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
     10    Fresh mint leaves; or
      1 ts -dried mint, crumbled
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 c  Olive oil
           Salt; to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Remove and discard the tougher outer leaves of the artichokes. Cut the
  remaining leaves halfway, with scissors, until you reach the central
  cone of leaves. At this point you will see that three-quarters of the
  leaves are white and the tip of the cone is pale green. Slice off the
  green top.
  
  Gently open the artichokes with your hands and remove the fuzzy
  chokes with a spoon or a melon scooper.  Rub the lemon over the cut
  edges of the artichokes to prevent discoloration.
  
  With a small knife, trim off the outer green part of the artichokes'
  green bottoms.  Trim the stalks, leaving about 2 inches intact. Trim
  away the greener outer part of the stalks, leaving the white part of
  the stalks intact.  Rub the cut edges of the artichokes with more
  lemon.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the bread, parsley, mint, garlic, and oil,
  and season.  Push the stuffing between the artichoke leaves and into
  each artichoke cavity.
  
  Place the artichokes, with their stalks pointing upward, in a small
  casserole.  Add the remaining oil and just enough water to come
  halfway up the artichokes. (If you have any stuffing left, add it to
  the casserole).
  
  Brush a piece of parchment paper with olive oil and place over
  artichokes.
   Cover the casserole with a tight lid and bake at 375F until tender,
  30 to 40 mintues.  Cool to room temperature.
  
  Arrange the artichokes with their stemps upward on a serving dish. If
  there is still quite a bit of watery juice in the casserole, cook it
  down over high heat until you 4 to 5 tablespoons left. Pour the sauce
  over the artichokes, let cool, and serve.

 Categories: Italian, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This is an absolutely no-fuss way to prepare artichokes, yet produces
  a delicious result.  The original Italian recipe on which this is
  based uses three times the amount of oil specified below, but the
  lower-fat version works fine.
  
  Have ready a basin of acidulated water.  Take 4 large artichokes or 8
  small ones and prepare them as described above, cutting them into
  quarters and dropping them into the basin as they are done. Pack the
  artichoke quarters in a single layer into a open pan. Pour over them
  enough boiling water to barely cover the artichokes, add 2
  tablespoons of olive oil and some roughly crushed peppercorns.  Boil
  hard until the water has evaporated, then add the juice of a lemon
  and stir.
  
  Put the artichokes into a serving dish and scatter with chopped
  parsley. They can be served hot or cold.

  chicken, 2 tablespoons of cream (or use evaporated skim milk),

    1/2    Lemon
      2 c  Soft Bread Crumbs
    3/4 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
    1/3 c  Chopped Parsley
      2    Cloves Garlic -- chopped
           Salt And Pepper

  across, leavinga level base so the artichokes will stand upright.
  Remove the tough outer leaves at the base and cut about 1/2" off the
  tips of the remaining leaves. With a sharp knife, slice the top of
  the artichokes straight across, taking off about 1". As you trim, rub
  the artichokes with the cut lemon to prevent discoloration. Tap them
  firmly on a hard surface to force the center leaves slightly open.
  Combine the bread crumbs, cheese, parsley and garlic. Blend well and
  season with salt and pepper. Distribute the filling among the 6
  artichokes, placing some in the center and tucking some between the
  spread leaves. Close the leaves gently and arrange the artichokes
  close together in a baking pan. Pour 1 Tbsp of oil over each. Add 1
  cup of water to the bottom of the pan. Cover tightly with aluminum
  foil and bake in a 325 F oven, basting occasionally, for about 1 hour
  45 minutes, or until the leaves pull out easily. Add waterif
  necessary to maintain a little liquid in the pan.

  **Sprinkle prepared pears with lemon juice to prevent discoloration.**
  
  Combine water, wine, sugar, cardamom (pop seed sout of the pods), and
  cloves in a sauce pan.  Bring to a boil, then add pear ahlves and

  seeds. Spoon out some onto a dessert plate, enough to cover most, but
  not all, of the bottom.  Drain the pears from their cooking liquid
  (which you may reserve, strain and add to fruit juice and put over
  ice for a cool drink) and place them cut side down in the puddle of
  the berry sauce. Sprinkle with rose petals for effect.

      Title: CARDAMOM ROLLS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Portion Four-Way Sweet 1 egg
           -yolk
           Bread Dough
           -1 tsp. cream or canned milk
      8    Pods whole cardamom
 
  *Use Grated Raw Potato Starter
  
  Remove cardamom seeds from pods and crush in mortar or place in small
  plastic bag and use rolling pin. Flatten the ball of dough. Sprinkle
  crushed seeds over surface and knead until evenly distributed through
  the dough.  Divide in twelve pieces and shape as desired for muffin
  tins. They can be made into a plain ball and then, after the top is
  generously buttered, cut deeply with a Kaiser cutter or slashed with
  a deep cross in the top with sharp knife or scissors. They are also
  nice made up in brioche shape.  Cut off about 1/4 of the dough and
  make a tiny ball to place firmly on top of the larger ball before
  brushing all over with butter. When light, bake for about 25 minutes
  in oven preheated to 350. About 5 minutes before the end of the
  baking period brush the tops of the rolls with the egg yolk and cream
  beaten together. Bake to a golden, glossy brown. These rolls are
  perfect for serving with a chilled fresh fruit salad and whipped
  cheese spread.

      Title: CARDAMON-ALMOND MUFFINS
 Categories: Breads, Digest
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground cardamon
    3/4 c  Soymilk
    1/2    Cup
 
  2     Tbsp  pear puree (directions follow) 2 tsp lemon juice 1 tsp
  almond extract 1 tsp vanilla 1 tsp artificial sugar substitute (or 2
  Tbsp sucanat) 2
     Tbsp  cornstarch
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Coat 10 muffin wells with non-stick
  spray. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In
  a medium bowl, stir together remaining ingredients. The cornstarch
  will tend to stick together as a lump; make certain it is completely
  dissolved in the liquid.  Pour dry ingredients in to wet and stir
  just long enough to mix completely.  Spoon batter into the prepared
  muffin wells (the wells will be about half-full). Bake muffins for
  25-30 minutes, until tops are lightly golden.  Allow the muffins to
  rest a few minutes before removing to a cooling rack.  Serve, or cool
  completely and store in an air-tight container up to two days.
  
  Pear puree:  Puree is easily made by blending, until smooth, half of
  the fruit in a 15 oz. container of canned pears (packed in fruit
  juice is preferrable) . "Baby food" pureed pears are an even faster
  alternative.
  
  Note: If pears packed in juice are used, 1/4 cup of the juice can be
  substituted for 1/4 of the soymilk and the sweetener omitted.

  :          *****  NONE  *****
  
  Find a corrugated cardboard box about 2 in larger around than a cookie
  sheet.  Make sure it has an intact bottom and top "ears". Cut the
  bottom out all the way around and secure together with duct tape.
  Line the box inside and out with heavy duty aluminum foil and secure
  seams with duct tape.  Cut foil at the corners to free "ears". This
  is for venting. Line the lid with foil and secure seams with duct
  tape. Get four wire coat hangers and snip the hook off below the
  twist and straighten. Punch holes in the box about 6 in from the top,
  then push hanger wires thorough to make a rack. To Use: Start a
  charcoal fire with 6-8 briquettes in an old metal pie pan.  Place a
  piece of foil on the ground shiny side up. Put the pie pan on the
  foil and place the oven over the pie pan. Put your food to be baked
  on the rack and cover with the lid. If you have a meat thermometer,
  stick it into the box just below the rack. 6-8 briquettes should
  bring temp to 325-350. Add or take out to adjust temp. This should be
  done before starting to bake.

  Saut the onions and garlic until barely soft.  Add the spices and saut
  until very soft.  Stir in the beans and orange juice and saute for
  about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Mash a
  few of the beans with a fork or that back of a spoon. Add salt and
  pepper to taste.
  
  From the _Moosewood Cooks At Home_ book, again.  They are a little

  This is good but more work. They could probably be served with

  Brown pork steaks in butter, margerine or oil. Set aside to cool.
  Deglaze skillet with 2 T water. Pour liquor into a 4 qt pot. Cut
  carots into 1/8" thick slices. Add to pot and set pot over medium
  heat. Add chicken stock, garlic salt, allspice, salt and pepper to
  pot. Remove any bones from the pork steaks and cut them crosswise
  into 1/4" wide strips. Add the pork strips to the pot. Core and
  coarsly chop the cabbage. Add to pot. Stir well to mix all the
  ingredients. Cover the pot and allow the meat and vegetables to steam
  for a few minutes, but not too long. The carrots and cabbage should
  still be somewhat crisp (al dente) when served. Serve with steamed
  rice. OPTIONS: Alter spices any way you like. Add, delete or
  substitute any of the ingredients. This dish is versatile, fast, easy
  and very inexpensive. Since this is my first attempt at uploading
  from MM to the Food Forum, I thought this was an appropriate recipe.
  It's the first thing I ever cooked that had more than one ingredient.
  It dates back to my college days (early 60's) when I, nor my
  roommates, had much money. We had to build meals for four hungry guys
  on a budget that allowed less than five bucks per meal. One of the
  group hailed from Jamaica W.I. He devised this recipe based (loosly)
  on something his grandmother prepared. It cost less than two bucks to
  feed us all. Needless to say we started eating a variation of this
  recipe almost every night. On Friday night we spent the money we had
  saved to buy the five basic food groups (chili dogs, fries, pizza,
  burgers and beer). Today, thirty years later, this recipe will still
  feed four people for less than five dollers and takes less than 20
  minutes to make.

    1/4 c  Tomato sauce
    1/2 ts Saffron

           Chicken broth
      1 cn Pimientos
 
  I love Puerto Rican Food!... It's usually simple, yet rich with lots
  of cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can
  be simplified to taste. I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and
  garlic with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).
  
  I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it
  interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).
  
  Wash chicken pieces, dry and rub with Seasoning Mix. Set in
  refrigerator for several hours or overnight.
  
  In heavy kettle, brown pork and ham in oil.  Reduce to moderate heat,
  add chicken pieces, and cook for 5 minutes.
  
  Reduce heat to low, add onion, peppers, tomato, and cilantro, and
  saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Meanwhile, drain liquid from can of peas into a measuring cup and add
  enough water or chicken broth to measure 2 1/2 cups if regular rice is
  used, or 3 1/2 cups if long grain rise is used. Reserve peas.
  
  Add to kettle salt, olives, capers, tomato sauce, saffron, and rice,
  and mix over moderate heat for 2 minutes.
  
  Add reserved liquid to kettle, mix well, and cook, uncovered over
  moderate heat until rice is dry.
  
  With a fork, turn rice from bottom to top.
  
  Cover kettle and cook over low heat for 40 minutes. Halfway during
  this cooking period, turn rice over again.
  
  Add peas, mix rice once more, cover, and cook for 15 minutes over low
  heat.
  
  Garnish rice with pimientos.

      Title: CARING FOR & STORING THE WOK
 Categories: Info/tips, Wok
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  A properly seasoned wok should not be scoured with abrasive material
  such as steel wool. After cooking foods in the wok, iti s best to run
  very hot water into it and clean the surface of the wok with a bamboo
  brush or plastic scour. Dry the wok thoroughly with a paper towel and
  store for future use. Some gourmets will place a small amount of oil
  on their fingertips to re-coat their woks to keep them in top cooking
  condition. Eventually through repeated usage, a dark brown film will
  develop in the wok. The wok is now truly seasoned. This film is
  essentially carbon and is not harmful to one's health. The bottom of
  the woks, the part that touches the cooking flame of the stove should
  definitely be scoured over occasionally to free it of collected
  residue.
  
  If one has the misfortune to accidentally burn food in the wok, it
  will be necessary to take steel wool and scour out the burnt material
  and then re-season the wok once again. Each time that one has to
  scour out the wok with abrasive material, then one should re-season
  the wok.
  
  Stainless steel woks sometimes stick when used to cook omelettes or
  for stir-frying meats. To overcome this problem, one can spend five
  minutes to "season" the wok before use or spray a coating of lecithin
  on the surface of the wok to allow for easy gliding of the foods.
  Lecithin is sold commercially under several brand names as
  "non-stick" cooking aids.

      1 c  Teriyaki marinade (Lawry's

      4    Lettuce leaves
      1 cn Mild green chili peppers
           (4-ounce) -- well drained
      4 sl American cheese
 
  1.   Marinate the chicken in the teriayki marinade in a shallow bowl
  for 30 minutes. 2.   Preheat a clean barbecue to medium grilling
  heat. 3. Prepare the sauce in a small bowlby mixing the mayonnaise
  with the paprika, cayenne pepper, curry powder, and salt. 4. Grill
  the chicken for 5 to 8 minutes per side, or until done. 5. Brown the
  faces of each bun in a hot frying pan. 6. Spread a tablespoon of
  sauce on the faces of each bun, top and bottom. 7. On each bottom bun
  place a lettuce leaf, then a green chili pepper.
   You want the pepper to spread over most of the lettuce. To do this,
  slice the pepper down the middle oand spread it open so that it
  covers more territory. When sliced open like this, some peppers are
  big enough for 2 sandwiches. Some are much smaller and enough for
  only one sandwich. 8. Place one chicken breast half on each fo the
  sandwiches, on top of the chili pepper. 9. Place a slice of American
  cheese on the chicken. 10. Top it all off with the top bun. Makes 4
  sandwiches.

      Title: CARL'S SICK SOUP
 Categories: Pasta, Poultry, Rice, Soups
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Water
      4 c  Chicken Broth
      3 tb Minced Green Onion
    1/2 ts Coarse Ground Black Pepper
      1    Palmful Fresh Parsely
      1 lb Boneless Skinless Chicken
           Breast -- cut in tiny
           Pieces
      6 lg Carrots -- sliced
      1 cn Unsalted Green Beans,
           Undrained -- --or--
      1 lb Fresh Green Beans
      2 c  Rice -- --Or--
      1 lb Angel Hair Pasta
 
  Start this recipe a day in advance by boiling the chicken pieces in
  the 4 cups of water with the green onion, black pepper, and parsely.
  Put it the refrigerator overnight and the next day scoop the fat off
  the top.
  
  The next day, bring 4 cups of water to a boil and add the carrots.
  Boil for 10 minutes or so.  Dump in the stock and chicken from the
  day before and the green beans and bring back to a boil. The next
  part of the cooking takes 20 minutes:
  
  For rice -- Add the rice and cook according to rice directions, about
  20 minutes for white rice (I've never used brown rice in this).
  
  For dry angel hair -- dump it in at such a time as the 20 minutes is
  up at the same time the angel hair's done to your liking.
  
  For fresh angel hair from the refrigerated section at the grocery --
  put it in 3-4 minutes before the 20 minutes is up. Don't overcook the
  angel hair!!
  
  I try to get the pasta to be al dente, although sometimes the wine
  makes me forget!!  You may want to experiment with spices because
  without salt, this recipe can be somewhat bland.
  
  One normal soup ladel full of this soup is somewhere around 300
  calories. I forget the actual calorie count of the individual
  ingredients, but I averaged them out from the counts given in a book
  I have. I do only one ladel. This stuff freezes well and makes great
  lunches.
  
  Oh, yes, the wine for this?  I like Bonny Doon '93 or '94 Clos du
  Gilroy. It has a peppery flavor that I think goes well with this
  light fare. My wife, a white wine fan, likes Chalk Hill Sauvignon
  Blanc (I forget the year model) because it too has a peppery flavor.

      1 lb Peanuts
      1    Egg white
      1 ts Cold water
      1 c  Brown sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Kathi Crockett Now, I'd better get a
  recipe in here before the troups kick me out. Here's a fun and very
  easy party recipe for candied nuts: CARMELED PEANUTS Beat egg white
  and water until frothy - not stiff. Add peanuts, stir until they are
  well coated. Combine sugar and salt then pour this over the nuts &
  eggwhite mixture. Bake at 225 on a greased, tinfoil lined cookie
  sheet. Stir every 15 minutes for 1 hour.
  
  This makes a nice, big batch and is delicious. You can also use other
  nuts. I first started doing this because I was always at a loss as to
  what to do with the leftover nuts from Christmas and this certainly
  takes care of them in short order. It's one of those recipes where
  you can't eat just one.

 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Chile caribe
      4 c  Water
      2 ts Salt
      3    Cloves garlic
      2 tb Ground Mexican oregano
      2 tb Ground comino -- ( cumin )
      5 lb Pork loin chops -- thinly
           Sliced
 
  Combine the Chile Caribe and water in  a blender ans whirl intul
  mixed into a sauce. It will become somewhat thick, similar to ketchup
  in consistancy. Add salt, garlic, oregano and comino to the sauce and
  mix well. Trim the excess fat from the pork and lay slices flat in a
  large baking dish. Cover with the sauce; turn the meat once to coat
  evenly on both sides. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator
  overnight. You can either cook this in the oven covered with aluminum
  foil at 325 degrees for 30 minutes then uncover and bake another 30
  minutes or grill over a fire with mesquite CHUNKS ( chips just burn
  up, chunks give a much better flavor ) that have been soaked for
  several hours in water. I prefer the grilling method. I also add a
  touch of oil to the marinade and baste my pork loin with it when
  grilling.  This makes great fajitas or just serve the meat as an
  entree with rice and good beans.

 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 kg Boneless pork, cubed
      2 lg Onions, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      3 lg Tomatoes, diced
    100 ml Boiling water
           Salt and pepper to taste
  1 1/2 c  Brown lentils
      4 c  Water
      4 lg Firm bananas
      3 tb Chopped fresh coriander
 
  Many years ago, restaurant dining meant fruit with every- thing. Now
  fruit is desperately passe. But it's a mistake to throw out the
  authentic with the spurious. This surprising but satisfying
  combination of ingredients originates in South America.
  
  In a large saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and brown on all
  sides 1 kg cubed boneless pork. Add 2 large onions, chopped, and 2
  cloves of garlic, minced, and brown them. Add 3 large tomatoes,
  diced, 100 mL boiling water and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and
  cook very slowly for about 1 1/2 hour. Meanwhile simmer 1 1/2 cups
  brown lentils in 4 cups water for 45 minutes; do not drain.
  
  Add the undrained lentils to the pork mixture, combine well, cover
  and cook over a low heat for a further 30 minutes, until both the
  pork and the lentils are tender.
  
  Taste for seasoning. Add 4 large firm bananas cut into 2 cm pieces
  and 3 tablespoons or more of chopped, fresh coriander. Cook 10
  minutes longer. Serve with a little more coriander scat- tered on
  top. (You can use the coriander stems as well as the leaves, provided
  they are well washed. Finely chopped they add interesting crunch.)

      Title: CARNE DE PUERCO CON CHILE VERDE
 Categories: Pork, Mexican, New_mexican
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Boneless pork roast
     48 oz Tomatillos, drained &
           -crushed
     16 oz Green chiles; chopped
           -(Ortega mild green)
      5    Garlic cloves; crushed
      1 lg Onion, chopped
    3/4 c  ;Water
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  optional -- your favorite fresh green chiles, chopped or sliced.
  Cilantro if you like it.
  
  Slice up the pork and trim away most of the fat.  Dice both the lean
  meat and the fat into 1/2-inch cubes; set the diced fat aside.
  
  In a heavy pot over a hot flame, cook the lean pork with the water,
  stirring until the water is gone and the meat begins to brown. Add
  onion & garlic, and stir constantly until the onion becomes
  transparent.
  
  Reduce heat to a simmer and add tomatillos & canned chilis (be *sure*
  to drain the tomatillos before crushing; the water they are packed in
  is too salty).
  
  Cover the pot and simmer slowly for about an hour, stirring
  occasionally to prevent sticking.
  
  Meanwhile, render the diced pork fat into cracklings by sauteeing in a
  skillet over medium heat until the pieces are brown and crispy. Drain
  and salt the cracklings and set aside; save the lard for any other
  dish where you want some high-quality cholesterol stuff.
  
  After an hour the chile verde should be pretty juicy but not watery.
  Add a little water if it's too dry. Add salt & pepper to taste, and
  if you want it hotter, add your fresh chiles now. Cover and simmer
  again for at least half an hour.  The longer the better.
  
  To serve, sprinkle with chopped cilantro (if used) and the cracklings.
  Serve with Spanish rice, tortillas, black beans, and ice-cold beer.
  Serves 6 or 8.

      1    Green pepper; sliced in
           - thin slices
      6 sl Bacon; cooked, crumbled
      4 oz Green chiles; diced
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
      1    Bay leaf
      8 oz Tomato sauce
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Flour
 
  Make a deep horizontal slit in the steak to form a pocket and set
  aside. Cook the green pepper in salted water for five minutes, drain
  and set aside. Stuff the steak with the bacon, chiles, and green
  pepper. Sew pocket shut. In a heavy skillet brown the meat in the
  reserved bacon drippings, then transfer to a 12x8" baking dish.
  Combine tomato sauce, sugar, vinegar, salt and bay leaf in the
  skillet. Heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves. Pour
  half of this sauce over the meat, reserving the rest. Cover the
  baking dish and bake 1 1/2 hours, basting with the pan juices
  occasionally. When meat is tender remove from oven and transfer meat
  to a heated platter. Skim any fat from the pan juices, then add water
  to the juices to make 2 1/4 cups liquid. Put liquid in skillet. Blend
  reserved sauce with the flour, and stir into the liquid. Cook and
  stir until thick and bubbly. Spoon sauce over the meat and serve.

 Categories: Lamb, Mexican
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Ancho chilies
      1 c  Boiling water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      4    Lamb shanks
      2 md White onions, halved
    1/3 c  Raisins
      2 tb Piloncillo, Mexican hard
           -sauce
      4 c  Garlic, minced
    3/8 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Cumin
     28 oz Tomato, whole peeled
    3/4 c  Beef stock
      4    Bay leaf
      1 tb Cider vinegar
           Romaine lettuce, shredded
           Black olives, pitted
 
  1. Place chilies in small bowl with boiling water, let stand 1 hour
  2. Heat lard or oil in Dutch oven over med. heat until hot. Add 2
  lamb shanks. Cook turning often, until brown on all sides about 20
  minutes. Remove to plate. Repeat. 3. Place chilies and 1/3 cup of the
  soaking liquid in a blender and process until smooth. Discard
  remaining soaking liquid. 4. Remove and discard all but 2 TBS oil
  from Dutch oven. Add onions and saute' over medium heat about 4 mins.
  or until soft. Reduce heat to med-low and stir in raisins, sugar,
  garlic, oregano and cumin. Add chili puree and cook stirring
  constantly for 2 minutes. 5. Add tomatoes, stock and bay leaves to
  pan. Heat to boiling. Add lamb shanks and simmer over low heat,
  covered, turning occasionally until lamb is very, very tender--about
  2 to 2/12 hours/ 6. Remove lamb to serving platter and keep warm.
  Skim and discard fat from cooking sauce. Stir in vinegar. Heat sauce
  to boiling over med.-high heat and cook uncovered, stirring
  frequently until sauce is thickened--about 10 minutes. Spoon sauce
  over lamb. Serve, garnished with lettuce and olives (Maybe even some
  quartered tomatoes). Accompany with Refried Beans garnished as
  desired with shredded cheese and diced white onions. I recommend with
  shanks that you clean them as well as possible of as much fat as
  possible plus that white membrane. Don't remove all the membrane,
  however, as something has to hold them together.

      1 c  Hot Water
      8 tb Unsalted Butter
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  All-Purpose Flour, Sifted

      1 ts Freshly Grated Lemon Rind
      4 c  Peanut Oil
           Confectioners Sugar
 
  Combine the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a small sauce pan and
  bring to a boil. When butter is melted, add flour. Stir vigorously
  with a whisk until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan, a matter
  of seconds. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
  
  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating vigorously with a spoon after
  each addition. Add the grated orange and lemon rinds. Mix thoroughly
  until smooth.
  
  In a deep skillet, heat the peanut oil to 300 F (the temperature is
  important because if the oil is too hot, the fritters will cook too
  fast on the outside and not puff up.)
  
  Drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the hot oil, no more than 4
  or 5 at a time. When the fritters are browned and puffed, remove them
  with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with
  confectioners sugar.

     12 md Cucumbers; sliced *

    1/4 c  Pickling salt
           Brine:
      3 c  Sugar
  4 1/2 ts Celery seed
      3 c  Cider vinegar
  4 1/2 ts Mustard seed
      2 ts Curry powder
      2 c  Water
 
  Recipe by: CAROL KOSOWSKI (YPZW00A) * (not too old as the older ones
  have too many seeds in them). In a large roasting pan,layer the
  cukes, then the onions,back to the cukes and the onions again
  sprinkling with the pickling salt in between the layers. let soak for
  3 hours and then drain the juice and discard. Next you make a brime
  for the pickles and onions. 3 cups of sugar, 4 1/2 teaspoons mustard
  seed, 4 1/2 tsp.celery seed, 2 tsp.curry powder, 3 cups cider vinegar,
        2    cups water. Heat this to boiling and then add the drained
  cukes and onions and simmer on low for10 min only.(hummm, it starts
  to smell up the kitchen and you just want to eat them right away).
  Now having hot sterilized large canning jars, fill to cover all the
  pickles and onions to the top. Put a bread knife into each jar to
  bring up the air in the liquid and of course don't leave it there,
  take the knife out and put on the caps and seal.  You may hear the
  seal take place with a pop and you can see that the cover seems to
  suck in and it should hold that way for a tight seal.I turn the jars
  over and let stand til cool. To check a tight seal you can push down
  on the top of the cover and if it does not snap up after you let go,
  then you have a tight seal.  If the cover does pop right up after
  pushing down and releasing then you have a poor seal, You could just
  eat those pickles now. yumm yumm.don'tput it away to store. You can
  also draw some water in a large bowl or pan or even in the sink and
  take each cooled jar and imerge the top into the water and check for
  bubbles coming from the top. If you see bubbles coming from the lid
  then you have a bad seal. Doesn't happen very often. Store the jars
  in a dark cool place.as far as how long you can keep them, you could
  keep them up to one year because of the vinegar will protect the
  pickles but I doubt it very much after you open one jar, it would
  last one year. Here is a pickle recipe I would love to share with you
  all.It is an old one I have had for over 30 years. CAROL KOSOWSKI

      2 tb Oil
      1    Celery rib; diced

    1/2 lb Tofu; crumbled (opt)
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Oregano
 
  Saute onion and garlic in oil until onion is soft. Add celery and
  spices. Saute another 2-3 minutes. Add tomato and paste. Mash 2 cups
  of the beans and add beans and tofu to the pot along with the salt
  and oregano. Simmer 30 minutes.
  
  To cook raw beans:
  
  Soak beans in water overnight, OR boil for 2 minutes and let sit,
  covered, for 1 hour.  Bring to a boil in same water and simmer about
  1 hour or until tender. (beans approximately double in volume, i.e.,
  two cups raw = 4 cups cooked)
  
  Notes:  I like cooking my own beans rather than buying canned beans.
  :       I use as many different beans as I have at home. Usually at
  :       least 3 of the 4 mentioned, and one of the 3 must be black
  :       beans because they are my absolute favorite.
  :       Add or subtract cayenne pepper for hotness level.
  :       A bit more cumin may be good too, I have yet to determine
  this,
  :       though.

      2 tb Dried cilantro
      4 tb Dried parsley
      1 tb Sugar
      2    Bay leaves
 
  Here is what I do.  I brown the meat in the olive oil. I add the
  onions & saute till they are somewhat tender. I then add all the
  other ingredients. Usually the canned ones first then the fresh
  ingred. Let this come to a boil & then turn down.  Simmer with the
  stockpot cover OFF for 6 or more hours.  Of course, you can use
  sooner. I like it to cook down & thicken. Either way it is very good.
  Many times I add more mushrooms as I like them. Do slice them
  thickly; i.e. 3 slices to one very large mushroom. I like to see the
  mushrooms! SMILE. This isn't a traditional recipe for spaghetti
  sauce.  It is something that has "happened" over the years. It
  finally developed into what you see. My husband, Punky aka Hap,
  enjoys this recipe very much.  I certainly hope you do too. I don't
  think I have forgotten anything. Oh, we use the low salt stuff - you
  don't have to do that. My guy had bypass surgery in Aug. so we are
  watching the sodium. I now make this with ground turkey too.  It is
  very good with the turkey. Several Prodigy members have tried this
  recipe. To my delight--they have liked it very much.  I hope you do
  too.  Oh, yes, this does freeze well. I just made 16 quarts of this
  on Sunday. I usually add some more garlic when I unfreeze a portion.
  This seems to make it tastier. We love garlic in our sketti! I also
  add some red crushed pepper flakes to my plate of sketti. Punky does
  not like things as hot as I. Remember to adjust seasonings to your
  taste. Enjoy. Carol Rheaume-Frischknecht l/l5 ll:03 PM PST

  bouillon cube.  Add the chili powder and the hot sauce. Bring to a
  boil, stirring all ingredients together.  Reduce the heat and simmer
  for 15 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender but yet crisp.  Be
  sure to stir occasionally so things don't burn on the bottom of the
  pot.
  
  When finished toss with pasta and then sprinkle on liberal amounts of
  parsley.

      Title: CARRAGEEN PUDDING WITH RHUBARB & ROSEHIP JE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 pt Milk
      1    Strip lemon peel
    1/2 oz Prepared dried carrageen *
      1 tb Sugar
      1    Egg
      2    Sticks rhubarb **
      4 tb Rosehip or redcurrant jelly
 
  *Note: Carrageen is a purple-brown or green fronded seaweed common on
  Scottish beaches on the mid-tide line. It can be used to set and
  delicately flavour a jelly or thicken a soup. If you gather your own
  fresh, you will need about 2 oz to set a pint of milk. Dried
  carrageen is available in health-food stores, or Chinese supermarkets
  in processed form, as agar-agar. **Rhubarb sticks should be sliced
  and lightly poached with additional sugar. Bring the milk to the boil
  with the lemon rind. Stir in the carrageen and cook for a couple of
  minutes until the milk thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden
  spoon. Add sugar. Allow the mixture to cool until it is at blood
  temperature (100 F, 40 C). Whisk the egg till frothy and then whisk
  in the warm milk until smooth. Pour the mixture through a sieve into
  a cold-wetted ring-mould. Then put it in the fridge to set - it will
  only take about 1/2 hour. Run hot water over the outside of the mould
  and turn out the jelly. Fill the middle of the ring with a ladleful
  of rhubarb compote and surround with a little scarlet sauce of
  rosehip or redcurrant jelly melted in a little hot water.

      Title: CARRIBEAN SUNSET JELL-O
 Categories: Alcohol, Beverages

      1 lg Box Orange Jell-O; or two
           -small boxes
      2 c  Boiling Water
  1 1/2 c  Cold Water
    1/2 c  Rum; * see note
           -----Variation-----
      1 sm Box Orange Jell-O; or Cherry
           -Jell-O
      1 c  Boiling Water
      1 c  Cold Water; (package
           -directions)
 
  * (I used "Cockspur" dark rum from Barbados, West Indies.)
  
  Little "souffle cups" or Dixie Cups, Bathroom-size
  
  Make up the Orange Jell-O, with the rum, in the usual way. (Dissolve
  the Jell-O thoroughly in the boiling water, etc.)
  
  Distribute into individual servings.
  
  Make up the Orange Jell-O without the rum, in the usual way.
  
  Distribute into individual servings.
  
  Let all of the Orange Jell-O set for about 1-2 hours. (It helps if
  you mark them specially, or put them in different cups, or on
  different trays or different refrigerators or something. I put an X
  on the non-alc. cups.)
  
  Mix up the Cherry Jell-O. Let it cool, about half an hour or so.
  
  Make sure the Orange Jell-O (both with and without rum) have set
  enough not to slosh when you wiggle them. Pull a tray out of the
  fridge (I assume you set the cups on trays!) and carefully pour a
  little bit of Cherry Jell-O on top of each serving. Just enough to
  cover them. Then put them back in the fridge, and do the next batch.
  (Do the rum ones first, then the nonalcoholic.)
  
  If you do it just right, there should be enough cherry Jell-O to make
  a little red layer on top of each orange Jell-O cup. If you
  miscalculate, well, you'll probably have a bunch of regular ordinary
  orange Jell-O, and the kids will still be happy with them. (Plus
  they'll be easier to tell apart.)
  
  Put it all back in the fridge, let 'em set, serve the next day.
  Voila, you have regular and unleaded (atomic and steam-powered?)
  versions, and (apart from the rum flavor) they'll be similar.
  Everyone will be happy. That's the theory, anyway...
  
  Good luck! I'm taking them to a club meeting tonight, we'll see if it
  goes over well..

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lg Carrot
      1 lg Potato
    1/2    Onion
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 tb Milk
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 tb Flour
           Olive oil
           Creme fraiche
 
  These little pancakes, like a lot of now fashionable food, are
  equally at home as nursery fare or as an entree or side-dish at a
  smart dinner party. Nice served with a dollop of creme fraiche.
  
  Grate (a food processor speeds things up) 1 large carrot, 1 large
  potato and half an onion and transfer to a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons
  chopped parsley, 1 egg, beaten, 1 1/2 tablespoons milk, salt and
  pepper to taste and 1 tablespoon plain flour. (Add a little more
  flour if the mixture looks too thin.) Heat a little olive oil in a
  heavy frying pan and drop in the mixture by the dessertspoon if you
  want elegant little pancakes, by the heaping tablespoon for a more
  pedestrian size. Cook until brown and crisp on the underside then
  turn and cook the other side. Serve.

  about 5 minutes. Stir in the celery mushrooms, and carrots and cook
  for 10 minutes, stirring often. Add the broth, orange juice, sherry,
  thyme, optional calendula petals, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil,

  NOTES : Serve with Calendula petals: bright color and peppery flavor.
  Nasturtium flowers may be substituted. Calendula were once part of
  everyday cooking in medieval times. Now they are sold at health food
  stores. Also nice with a blend of rices: white, brown and black.

 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      2 lb Carrots; chopped med. small
      2 lg Onions; chopped medium small
           Water (as needed)
    1/4 c  Olive oil
  1 1/2 lb Zucchini; peeled
           - (reserve the skins),
           -  and chopped medium small
      1 lg Leek; well washed and
           -  chopped medium small
 
  In a large skillet place the first 1/4 cup of the olive oil and heat
  it on medium high until it is hot. Add the carrots and onions, and
  saut them for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are clear. Add
  enough water to cover the vegetables.  Simmer them for 30 to 40
  minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.  Place the vegetables in a
  blender and pure them until they are smooth.  Set the pure aside
  and let it cool.
  
  In another large skillet place the second 1/4 cup of olive oil and
  heat it on medium high until it is hot. Add the peeled zucchini and
  leeks, and saut them for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are just
  tender. Add enough water to cover the vegetables.  Simmer them for 25
  to 30 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed. Place the vegetables
  in a blender and pure them until they are smooth. Set the pure
  aside and let it cool.
  
  Place the zucchini skins in a pot of boiling water and blanch them
  for 3 minutes.  Drain the skins and place them in a blender. Add a
  small amount of cold water and pure the skins so that a thick,
  smooth consistency is achieved (the same consistency as the other 2
  pures). Set the pure aside and let it cool.

      5    Eggs; separated
    275 g  Sugar
      1    Lemon; juice
      2    Lemons; zest, grated
    250 g  Almonds; ground
    300 g  Carrots; finely grated
     75 g  Cornflour
      1 pn Cinnamon; ground
      1 pn Cloves; ground
     10 g  Baking powder
    1/2 dl Kirsch
      1 pn Salt
           - for glazing
     50 g  Apricot jelly
           Fondant icing
           Marzipan carrots
 
  (Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350
  oF; 200 oC = 400 oF; 230 oC = 450 oF; 250 oC = 475 oF; 2.5 cm = 1
  inch)
  
  The Story:
  
  The cultivation of vegetables in Aargau is one of the main reasons
  for the existence of a thriving canning/bottling industry. In this
  area, the carrot is the Queen of all vegetables and it has attributes
  which allow it to be used everywhere, even in desserts.
  
  This carrot cake is now a Swiss classic, its reputation having been
  extended long ago far beyond the borders of the canton. Some maintain
  that the cake is better two days after baking as the carrots keep it
  moist.
  
  The Recipe:
  
  Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest, until
  light.
  
  Add the finely grated carrots and the almonds.
  
  Mix in the cornflour, cinnamon, ground cloves and baking powder. Then
  add the kirsch.
  
  Mix or beat until smooth.
  
  Beat the egg whites until stiff and carefully fold in.
  
  Butter a tin (24 cm diameter, 5 cm high), dust with flour. Turn the
  mixture into the tin.
  
  Bake in the oven for 50 ... 60 minutes at 180 oC.
  
  When cooked, brush the cake with a hot apricot glaze and thin fondant
  icing. Decorate with small marzipan carrots.

      Title: CARROT CAKE WITH AN INDIAN FLAVOR
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Indian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 ts Vegetable oil
      1 c  Unbleached white flour
           -- plus extra for dusting
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs
    1/4 ts Ground cardamom seeds
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Softened clarified butter
           -- (ghee)
  1 1/2 c  Grated carrots
           -- firmly packed
      2 tb Chopped pistachios
      2 tb Chopped blanched almonds
      2 tb Raisins
           Edible silver foil (opt.)
 
  "A characteristic sweet of southern India is carrot halvah, a rich,
  sweet reduction of carrots and spices that is almost fudgelike in
  consistency. This cake falls somewhere between this traditional treat
  and the popular American carrot cake.  It has a dense texture and the
  unexpected flavor of cardamom, yet doesn't require the tedious
  cooking and stirring of a halvah.
  
  "Special Indian dishes are often decorated with silver foil -- a
  microscopic thin sheet of edible, flavorless real silver, available in
  Indian groceries.  We have cut edible foil into decorative shapes -- a
  tedious business that must be done in a completely draftless room --
  but more manageable solid toppings are customary.
  
  "Serve this nontraditional ending to your Indian meal with coffee
  that has been brewed with a few cardamom seeds."
  
  Rub a round cake pan that is 9 inches in diameter and 1-1/2 inches in
  height with the vegetable oil and then dust it very lightly with
  flour. Preheat the oven to
      350    F.
  
  Sift 1 cup flour with the baking soda and salt.
  
  Beat the eggs well in a large bowl.  Add the cardamom, sugar, and
  clarified butter.  Keep beating until all the ingredients are
  thoroughly mixed.
  
  Add the sifted flour mixture to the ingredients in the large bowl and
  fold it in gently with a spatula.  Add the carrots, pistachios,
  almonds, and raisins.  Fold them in gently as well.
  
  Turn the cake batter into the oiled and floured cake pan and bake for
  35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes
  out clean and the top is golden red.  Decorate top with edible silver
  foil.

    1/2 c  Water
 
  Cook carrots, sugar, milk, and water, to soft ball stage (234 - 238
  F). Remove from fire, add flavoring, and cool to room temperature.
  Beat until creamy.  Pour into buttered pan, pat down to 1 inch depth,
  and when firm cut in squares.  The grain is likely to be a little
  coarse due to the grated carrots. Mrs. L.G. Humichl, Perry, IA.

      2 c  Carrots; sliced
    1/4 c  Onion; diced
      1 ea Garlic clove; slivered
    1/4 ts Dill
      2 tb Olive oil

      1 tb -Water
      2 tb White miso
    1/4 ts Sea salt
      2 tb Tahini; optional
 
  "For this recipe you may use a food processor instead of a blender to
  puree the carrots. Mash the carrots roughly before pureeing them. You
  might need to add a little extra water; in which case, simmer the
  pureed, flavored carrots for a little while longer. The pare should
  not feel wet. The additional of two tablespoons of tahini will make
  the pate taste richer and help hold the ingredients together."
  
  In a medium saucepan, saute the carrots, onions, garlic and dill in
  the oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the water, cover, and simmer until
  the carrots are tender (about 20 minutes). Puree until a smooth paste
  and return to the saucepan. Combine the dissolved arrowroot, miso,
  salt and tahini, if you wish. Add this mixture to the pureed carrots.
  Bring to a slow simmer, stirring constantly and cook until the pate
  detaches itself from the sides of the pan. Remove from heat, turn the
  pate mixture out onto a lightly oiled serving dish and let cool.
  Serve the pate with crackers or toast, or serve it as a dip with
  crisp, raw vegetables.

  _____________________ smoothing secrets prevent lumps by stirring
  flour into melted butter with a wire whisk, gradually add the half
  and half white stirring constantly. cook four mixture over medium
  heat; high heat can cause it to curdle _____________________
  eggsclusive secrets carefully separate cold eggs stirring a small
  amount of hot mixture into beaten egg yolks warms them. This step --
  called tempering -- prevents the egg yolks from lumping (coagulating)
  _______________________ puffing secrets even the smallest amount of
  fat, including that in a ddrop of yolk, keeps the egg white from
  beating properly. Because wooden and plastic bowls tend to absorb fat
  avoid using them when beating egg whites stiff but not dry mean egg
  whites no longer slip when the bowl is titled. To fold in a beated
  egg white, use a down-across-up-and-over motion with a rubber spatual
  to cut through the carrot mixture. Fold just until there aren't any
  remaining streaks.  don't stir -- it forces out the air in the beaten
  white. ___________________ dish size is important; if the container
  is too small, the mixture may run over, if the container is too large
  the mixture won't rise to the rim and have it tradition appearance.
  Use a straight-sided casserole if you don't have a traditional
  souffle dish. _______________________ BAKING SECRETS Place souffle
  into a preheated oven immediately after mixing. Don't peek, opening
  the oven door will cause a souffle to collapse. the top will be
  slightly firm to the touch.

  SCRAPE THE CARROTS and slice them into pieces 2- to 3-inches long.
  Cut each piece lengthwise into quarters or, if the carrots are very
  large, into sixths or eighths. All the pieces should be about the
  same size. Tear or chop the herbs. Warm the oil with the cumin seeds
  and green herbs for a few moments to bring out their fragrances; then
  add the carrots and toss them in the oil. Add a few pinches of salt,
  the water, and the vinegar; bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and
  simmer until tender, about 40 minutes. By this time, the liquid
  should have reduced to almost nothing, leaving the carrots nicely
  glazed. If the pan becomes dry before the carrots are done, add more
  water in 1/4- or 1/2-cup increments until they are sufficiently
  tender. When done, season with pepper and serve with a garnish of
  fresh herbs.

      Title: CARROTS WITH GINGER & ORANGE
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb (scant) maincrop carrots
      3 sm Oranges
           Fresh ginger root
      1 sm Garlic clove
      1 oz Walnut kernals
      1 sm Bunch of mint
      1 ts Honey
      1 ts Lemon juice
           Olive oil
 
  First make the dressing.  Finely grate the zest of 1 orange into a
  bowl. Add its juice, the honey and lemon juice and 1 tablespoon olive
  oil. Peel 1/2 inch or so of ginger and chop it as finely as possible;
  then crush the small garlic clove.  Add both these ingredients to the
  bowl with a little salt and pepper. Mix well then push 2 sprigs of
  mint into the liquid. Scrub and scrape the carrots, or peel them if
  you insist, then grate them coarsely and add to the dressing. Peel
  the remaining 2 oranges and cut into segments; be ruthless about
  cutting away all traces of pith and the membrane that divides one
  segment from the next. Remove pips (seeds) with the tip of a knife
  and add the oranges to the salad bowl. Mix all the ingredients
  together gently, then cover the salad and set it aside for 2 hours or
  a little longer to allow flavours to blend and develop. Close to
  serving time, remove and discard the tired sprigs of mint, stir in
  the walnuts and scatter with fresh torn mint leaves.

 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Olive oil or canola oil
      1 lg Onion
           - peeled & coarsely chopped
     20 sm Garlic cloves; peeled, whole
      1 c  Vegetable stock
      1 lb Carrots; cut into 1" chunks
    1/2 ts Dried rosemary leaves
    1/4 c  Coarsely chopped olive meat
           -(preferably oil-cured)
    1/4 ts Sea salt; or to taste
 
  PRESSURE COOKER:
  
  1.  Heat the oil in in the cooker and saute the onions and garlic
  until the onions are soft, about 2 minutes.
  
  2.  Add the stock (watch for sputtering oil!) and bring to the boil.
  Add the carrots, rosemary, olives and salt.
  
  3.  Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.
  Lower the pressure with a quick-release method. Remove the lid,
  tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. If the
  carrots are not quite done, set the lid back into place and let them
  cook in the residual steam for another minute or two.
  
  4.  Serve the mixture in small bowls or lift out the solid
  ingredients with a slotted spoon and serve them on a plate, reserving
  any leftover liquid for cooking grains or adding to the soup pot.
  
  STANDARD STOVETOP: In a heavy 3-quart saucepan, follow steps 1 and 2.
  Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until
  the carrots are tender, about 8 to 12 minutes. Follow step 4.
  
  VARIATION: Potatoes with Twenty Cloves of Garlic: Replace the carrots
  with small new potatoes about 1 ounce each, or larger thin-skinned
  potatoes cut into chunks. Cook them for 5 minutes under
  high-pressure, or 12 to 15 minutes standard stovetop method.

      Title: CARROTS WITH STAR ANISE
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Star Anise
  1 1/2 lb Carrots, Pref Organic
        pn Sugar
      1 oz Butter
        pn Salt
 
  I make this with organic carrots, their natural sweetness is
  unequalled by the other kind! Peel and trim the carrots and cut them
  across into slices about quarter of an inch thick. Put them in a
  solid pan, wide enough to hold them in two or three layers. Add the
  aniseed, which you can leave in the star shaped shell, the sugar,
  salt and butter and enough water just to cover everything. Cook them
  over a fierce heat, turning a couple of times, until the water boils
  away and the carrots just start to sizzle. At that moment the carrots
  will be done. It takes about 12 minutes, depending on the thickness
  and size of the pan. The carrots absorb the exotic flavour of the
  star anise and the butter and sugar coats them with a glaze.

      Title: CARROT~ CELERY~ & APPLE JUICE WITH SORREL
 Categories: Vegetables, Fruits
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      3 lb Of fresh whole carrots
      1    Or 2 stalk of celery
      1    Granny Smith apple
      3    To 6 sorrel leaves to taste
 
  This juice requires the use of a juice machine such as the Champion,
  the Juice Man, Olympic, or the like. The sorrel adds a nice lemony
  tartness to the drink that helps the celery balance the sweetness of
  the carrots. For the apple, use no other than the Granny Smith, its
  sour flavor is an essential ingredient to this juice.
  ******************************************************* *************
  Clean the carrots and remove any green parts. Wash the celery but do
  not remove the leaves. Cut the granny smith apple into 1/8th segments
  and remove the bitter seed pod. Rinse the sorrel leaves. Run
  everything through the juicer starting with the carrots. After one or
  two carrots have been run through the machine put the celery and
  sorrel through and then alternate carrots and apples until they are
  gone. Strain the juice through a couple layers of cheesecloth or a
  fine strainer to remove the pulp that makes it through the juicer
  screen if desired (this will produce a clear juice devoid of the
  grittyness, that some people do like).

 Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads
      Yield: 3 Sm. loaves
 
      1 ts Dried yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water
  3 1/2 c  Water at room temperature
  13/16 c  Biga Pugliese, see recipe
  3 3/4 c  Wholewheat flour
  3 3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      1 tb Salt
    1/3 lb Walnuts -=OR=-
    1/2 c  Shelled pistachios -=OR=-
    1/3 c  Pitted Italian black olive,
           -- all optional
 
  Stir the yeast into the warm water & let proof for 10 minutes. Add the
  remaining water & the biga, then the flours & the salt. Mix with a
  wooden spoon for 5 minutes. The dough will not pull away from the
  side of the bowl.  Wet your hands & knead on a lightly floured board
  to ensure that all the ingredients are well mixed. Turn into a
  lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap & let rise at room
  temperature until it has almost tripled in volume, 3 to 5 hours. This
  dough works very well if left to rise overnight or in the
  refrigerator. Let it come back to room temperature before shaping.
  Flour your work surface very well & flour a scaper. Turn the dough
  onto the work surface, but do not punch down. Divide into 3 equal
  pieces. Work in your filling if using by flattening the dough &
  sprinkling equal amounts of filing over the dough. Turn in the sides
  of the dough & roll each piece into a ball, being gentle but at the
  same time pulling the skin taut. Place the loaves on floured
  parchment paper set on baking sheets, cover with a heavy cloth & let
  rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450F.  Bake the
  loaves for 15 minutes. At this point the dough should be set you can
  remove the paper. Slide the loaves directly onto the baking sheets &
  bake until crusty & golden, about 30 to 35 minutes.

      4 c  Fresh Grapefruit juice
      1 c  Fresh Orange juice
      3 ts Allspice (Jamaican)
      1 ts Salt
 
  : NOTE: Cascabel Peppers, this pepper is small (1 1/2 inch or so),
  round and dark brown. This is the "little rattles" pepper that comes
  from the Veracruz area. This pepper is not elongated, not black, not
  from South America, and not real hot. Cascabel is also known as the
  chili bola. : METHOD: Remove stem and seed from chiles. With a comal
  or black iron skillet, or in an oven at 250 degrees, dry roast chiles
  for 3 to 4 minutes. Shake once or twice and do not allow to blacken.
  Add to the water in a covered pan and simmer very low for 20 minutes
  to rehydrate. Allow to cool. SEE HINT. Taste the chile water, and if
  not bitter, add about 1/2 cup and the chiles to a blender (use plain
  water if bitter). Puree together with the garlic and strain. Add the
  fruit juices, allspice, and salt and mix together. : HINT: If a very
  smooth sauce is required, pass the rehydrated, coarsely chopped,
  chiles through a food mill, then proceed as above.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Honey
  1 1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice
      2 c  Roasted cashews
 
  In a heavy saucepan, preferably nonstick, bring the honey and lemon
  juice to a boil over medium-high heat.
   Add the nuts and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture
  thickens and darkens (be careful not to let it burn), about 15-20
  minutes. Pour out onto a nonstick pan, such as a jellyroll pan or a
  large skillet moistened with cold water and spread to a thickness of
  about 1/4 inch. Let cool completely. When fully hardened, break into
  small pieces. Makes about 3/4 pound of candy. Store in a tightly
  sealed tin.
  
  Since I adapted this from a recipe for nuant, or walnut brittle, I
  guess you can use any kind of nuts. You could dip the finished candy
  in melted chocolate, too.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Light corn syrup
      1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Water
      3 c  Unsalted raw cashew nuts;
           -coarsely chopped
      2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Butter 2 baking sheets and set aside. Butter the sides of a 3-quart
  saucepan, and add the sugar, corn syrup, butter, and water. Stir over
  low heat until the butter has melted. Increase the heat and bring the
  mixture to a boil. Continue cooking over moderate heat, without
  stirring, for about 20 minutes, until the temperature reaches 275
  degrees F. (soft-crack stage) on a candy thermometer. Add the cashew
  nuts and continue cooking for about 5 minutes, until the candy
  thermometer registers 295 degrees F. (hard crack stage.) You may stir
  occasionally, if necessary. Remove from the heat and immediately sift
  the baking soda evenly over the surface. (Be careful---the syrup will
  foam up.) Add the vanilla and stir to distribute the soda and vanilla
  throughout the mixture. Pour at once onto the prepared baking sheets.
  Tilt the sheets to spread the brittle about 1/2-inch thick. Allow to
  cool until firm. Break the brittle into pieces and store in an
  airtight container. Variation: Peanuts or other nuts can be added
  instead of the cashews, or you can use a combination of several nuts.
  Always choose the raw unsalted nuts that are available in health-food
  and speciality stores. The nuts will cook and "toast" when added to
  the hot syrup. Makes abouy 2 pounds.

      1 lg Onion; sliced
      8 oz Unroasted cashew nuts
      4 oz White bread; crusts removed
      2 lg Garlic cloves
      7 fl Water or light veg. stock
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Grated nutmeg
      1 tb Lemon juice

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE STUFFING---------------------------
      4 oz White breadcrumbs
      2 oz Butter (or margarine)
      1 sm Onion; grated
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Marjoram
      1 oz Parsley; chopped

MMMMM-------------------------TO GARNISH------------------------------
           Parsley sprigs
           Lemon slices
 
  Set the oven to 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6 and line a 450 g/1lb loaf tin
  with a long strip of nonstick paper; use some of the butter to grease
  the tin and paper well. Melt most of the remaining butter in a medium
  sized saucepan, add the onion and fry for about 10 minutes until
  tender but not browned. Remove from the heat.
  
  Grind the cashew nuts in a food processor with the bread and garlic,
  and add to the onion, together with the water or stock, salt, pepper,
  grated nutmeg and lemon juice to taste.
  
  Mix all the stuffing ingredients together.
  
  Put half the cashew nut mixture into the prepared tin, top with the
  stuffing, then spoon the rest of the nut mixture on top. Dot with the
  remaining butter.  Stand the tin in another tin to catch any butter
  which may ooze out, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until firm and
  lightly browned.  (Cover the roast with foil if it gets too brown
  before then.)
  
  Cool for a minute or two in the tin, then slip a knife around the
  sides, turn out the nut roast and strip off the paper. Decorate with
  sprigs of parsley and small slices of lemon, and surround with roast
  potatoes, if you're serving them.

  Cut beef into 1-1/2" cubes.  Brown the meat and onions in oil or fat.
  
  Add the tomato sauce, beer, beef stock, chiles, cumin, garlic, black
  pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the Chili Powder. Simmer the chili over
  a low head for 2 hours until the meat is tender.
  
  To thicken, make a thin paste of the masa and water. Quickly stir
  this into the chili -- if done too slowly it will lump.
  
  Add the remaining Chili Powder and Paprika.  Simmer for an additional
  15 minutes.  Remove the Jalapenos and serve.

  winners tend to use blended chili powder and also Jalape#o chiles,
  which are usually removed before serving. The beef is cubed, and
  masa, which is flour made from ground dried maize available in Latin
  markets, is used to thicken the chili.]

 Categories: Fish, Seafood, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Dried salt cod
      6 c  Boiling water
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 lg Spanish onion
           - peeled and sliced thin
      2 lb Calif. long white potatoes
           -or new potatoes,
           -boiled until tender, then
           -peeled and sliced thin
    1/3 c  Minced parsley
    1/4 c  Freshly ground black pepper

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 lg Egg, hard-cooked, shelled
           -and cut in thin wedges
     12 md Oil-cured black olives
           - (unpitted)
 
  SOAK THE COD in the refrigerator 24 hours in several changes of cold
  water. Drain, rinse, and drain well again. Place the cod in a large
  heavy saucepan, pour in the boiling water, set over moderate heat,
  cover and simmer 10-to-12 minutes--just until the cod flakes at the
  touch of a fork. Drain and rinse well, then flake the cod, removing
  any bits of skin or bone. Preheat the oven to 350F. In a large heavy
  skillet set over moderate heat, warm the butter and 1 tablespoon of
  the oil 1 minute. Add the onion, separating the slices into rings,
  and stir-fry 8-to-10 minutes until limp and golden; do not brown.
  Remove the onion from the skillet and set aside. Add the remaining
  oil to the skillet, dump in the potatoes and stir-fry about 5 minutes
  until golden. Layer half the potatoes in a well-buttered 2-quart
  casserole or au gratin pan and sprinkle with a little of the minced
  parsley and pepper. Add 1/3 of the onion, 1/2 of the cod and another
  scattering of the parsley and pepper. Repeat the layering, ending
  with onion rings on top. Sprinkle with the remaining pepper and all
  but 1 tablespoon of the parsley. Bake the casserole, uncovered, for
  35-to-40 minutes or until touched with brown. Garnish with wedges of
  hard-cooked egg and the olives, placed artfully on top of the
  casserole, plus a final light scattering of minced parsley.

      Title: CASSEROLE OF VENISON W/ PRUNES & PICKLED WALN
 Categories: Scot/irish, Meats, Casseroles
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Flour; all-purpose (heaped)
    1/2 ts Salt
           Black pepper to taste
      3 lb Venison; cut into 1-inch
           .  cubes
      4 tb Sunflower oil
      3    Onions; finely sliced
  2 1/2 c  Red wine
  2 1/2 c  Water
      1 cn Pickled walnuts; 15oz, drain
      8    Prunes; soaked until soft,
           .  stoned & chopped
 
    The prunes and pickled walnuts provide just the sweet and sharp
  contrast that complements the flavour of venison so well.
  
    Put the flour, salt and a good grinding of pepper into a bowl. Toss
  the pieces of venison in the seasoned flour to coat. Heat the oil in
  a heavy flameproof casserole and brown the meat, a few pieces at a
  time; remove the browned meat and keep it warm while you brown the
  rest. When all the meat is browned, add the onions to the casserole
  and cook them until they are soft and translucent, 5-10 minutes. Stir
  in the wine and water, scraping the bits off the bottom of the
  casserole with a wooden spoon. When the liquid is simmering. replace
  the browned meat in the casserole, and stir in the pickled walnuts
  and prunes.
    Cover the casserole with a lid, and cook in a preheated moderate
  oven (350F / 180C / gas 4) for an hour. Let the casserole cool
  completely, then store in the refrigerator overnight. Cook it for a
  further hour at the same temperature before serving. All stews and
  casseroles benefit in flavour from reheating. "Lady MacDonald's

 Categories: Drinks, Spanish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Cocoa (powdered),
           -unsweetened
      1 c  Sugar
      7 ts Cornstarch (cornflour)
    1/2 c  Water
      4 c  Milk
 
  Mix the cocoa and sugar together.
  
  Dissolve the cornstarch (cornflour) in the water and combine with the
  cocoa-sugar mixture in a medium-sized saucepan. Stir this until it is
  a smooth paste. Begin heating this mixture, continuously stirring it
  with a whisk.  Gradually pour in the milk.  Continue stirring as you
  bring it to a simmer.  Simmer, stirring often, for about 10 minutes.
  The cocoa is ready when it thickens and is glossy and smooth.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Thick, rich Spanish hot chocolate -- I first tasted this wonderful
  beverage while touring in northern Spain with a choir. It's not like
  any hot chocolate I've had anywhere else, and I was delighted to find
  a recipe in "The Vegetarian Epicure Book Two." It is the best hot
  chocolate in the world (at least to me.)
  
  *  The consistency of the finished product should resemble chocolate
  pudding that didn't quite set. If you halve this recipe, you'll get
  just the right amount for two large mug-fulls. This cocoa is
  especially fantastic when you dip churros into it (a churro is a
  sugary, deep-fried, doughnut-like stick, and if anyone wants to send
  out a recipe, I'd be most grateful).

      1 c  Bisquick
      1 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
      1 lb Ground beef, turkey or pork
           Sausage

MMMMM-----------------------TO MAKE LITTER----------------------------
      2 c  Long grain rice
  3 3/4 c  Water
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter or margarine

MMMMM---------------------------TOOLS--------------------------------
        lg Mixing bowl
           Rectangular baking pan
           Deep saucepan with lid

           Paper towels
        lg Spoon
           Stainless steel pooper
           Scooper
 
  To make dumps: With an adult's help, preheat the oven to 350F. Using
  clean hans, mix together the dump ingredients in a large bowl. Mold
  pieces of this mixture into various size/shape dumps.
  
  Place so they don't touch each other in an ungreased baking pan. Use
  two if they don''t all fit. With an adult's help, bake the dumps for
  about 20 minutes or until they are all brown, firm and slightly
  crusty.
  
  While the meat cooks, put all four litter ingredients into a large
  saucepan. Then, with an adult's help, heat on high until the water
  comes to a boil. Stir, turn heat to low and cover the pan. Simmer
  without lifting the cover for fourteen minutes.
  
  With an adult's help, remove the saucepan from the stove and
  carefully (to avoid having your face melted away by the steam), lift
  off the cover. Break apart, or "fluff" the rice with a fork and set
  pan aside.
  
  When dumps are done, carefully transfer them onto paper towels to
  drain.
  
  Spoon the rice and dumps into the now empty baking pan, leaving some
  dumps partially uncovered, the way Kitty does when he/she is in a
  hurry. Serves 8-10 litterbox lovers. Use ppper scooper to serve.

  especially well at the halloween party where the table was already

      Title: CATALAN LAMB - GARLIC LAMB
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 tb Olive oil
      1    Shoulder of lamb
     20    Cloves garlic, peeled
           Flour
    300 ml Stock
      1 tb Tomato puree
 
  This recipe from northern Spain takes only minute of the cook's time
  but produces melting lamb in a lush sauce, thick with sweet (and
  innocuous) cloves of garlic.
  
  In a wide casserole which can be used on top of the stove, heat a
  tablespoon of olive oil and brown a shoulder of lamb on both sides.
  remove the meat and add to the saucepan 20 peeled whole cloves of
  garlic. Cook gently for a few minutes and sprinkle in a few
  tablespoons of flour, stir well, then continuing to stir, add 300 ml
  stock mixed with a tablespoon of tomato puree. Return the meat to the
  casserole, turn it over in the stock mixture, cover tightly and
  simmer very gently until the meat is cooked. Turn the meat over
  halfway through cooking and check at intervals, adding more stock if
  the sauce is getting dry.

  1 1/3 c  Honey
      2    Egg whites; stiffly beaten
    1/2 lb Almonds; blanched; peeled
           -kept warm
  3 1/2 oz Hazelnuts; roasted; peeled
           Kept warm (about 3/4 cup)
           Edible rice paper
 
  Put the honey in a heavy saucepan and place over medium heat. Stir it
  with a wooden spoon and when the honey begins to boil, remove the pan
  from the heat. Continue stirring until the honey thins to the
  consistency of pancake syrup.  Stir in the egg whites and return the
  mixture to the heat; continue cooking until it reaches a toffee-like
  consistency (hard-ball stage). Stir in the nuts and mix well.
  
  Spread the mixture in a jelly-roll pan lined with edible rice paper.
  Cover with a second sheet of rice paper and weight the top. Let it
  cool, then cut the nougat into 1-inch squares.
  
  When making nougat, the nuts should be warm.  Cover freshly peeled
  nuts with foil to retain the warmth they gained in blanching or
  roasting; wrap previously peeled nuts in foil and warm them in a
  200-degree F. oven for 15 minutes.

      Title: CATALAN SHREDDED SALT COD SALAD
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Salt cod -- boneless, dried
      1 sm Red or green bell pepper --
           Prepared
    1/2 lg Red onion -- thinly sliced
      1 lg Tomato -- thinly sliced
    1/3 c  Fruity Spanish olive oil
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
      4 lg Garlic cloves -- finely
           Chopped
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Oil cured black olives
      3    Hardboiled eggs --
           Quartered
    1/2 sm Bunch oregano leaves- finely
           -chopped
 
  To prepare the salt cod, rinse it well and then immerse it in a
  container of cold water (cut into chunks, if necessary, to fit).
  Refrigerate, changing the soaking water 5 or 6 times, until softened
  and mild (24 to 48 hours, depending on how stiff and salty it was to
  begin with).
  
  Drain the cod, place it in a large saucepan with the onion and the bay
  leaves, and cover with cold water. Bring just to a boil, reduce the
  heat to very low, and cover (taste the water at this stage and, if it
  seems excessively salty, then drain, cover again with fresh cold
  water, and bring to a boil). Simmer very gently until the fish is
  opaque and plumped, and falls apart into heavy flakes when prodded,
  about 20 minutes. Drain, pat dry, and remove the bones and skin, if
  necessary. Separate into large flakes and use right away, or
  refrigerate for up to 2 days before continuing with the recipe.
  
  Drain and press the cod with your fingers to extract as much water as
  possible. Shred the cod by hand into thin strips and transfer it to a
  large bowl.
  
  Core, seed and wash the pepper.  Cut into thin rings. Separate rings
  of onion. Select 1 large, firm, ripe tomato and slice it thinly.
  
  Add the pepper rings, onion, and tomato to the bowl and toss together
  gently. In another bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, garlic, pepper,
  and if desired, a little salt (the salt cod is usually still quite
  salty; taste it to determine if the vinaigrette needs any salt).
  Whisk the vinaigrette together until thoroughly blended.
  
  Using your hands, toss the salad with the vinaigrette until all the
  ingredients are coated. Transfer the salad to a platter and garnish
  the edges with olives and wedges of hardboiled egg. Scatter the
  oregano over the dish.  Yields 6 servings

      Title: CATFISH IN RED CURRY SAUCE
 Categories: Fish, Catfish, Curry, Stove top
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Red curry paste
      4 tb Peanut oil
      2 c  Coconut milk
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      3 tb Fish sauce
      2 lb Dressed catfish cut in
           Steaks
      1 tb Substitute Italian basil
      1    3 fresh hot chilies chopped
 
  Heat the curry paste in oil, stirring for about 2 minutes over med
  heat. Add 1/4 cup of coconut milk and the fish sauce and simmer
  slowly for another 2 minutes. Add the salt, sugar and the rest of the
  coconut milk. Bring to a boil and, as soon as the sauce boils, add
  the fish. DO NOT STIR THE FISH UNTIL THE SAUCE RETURNS TO A BOIL.
  Chai says that if you disturb the fish before the sauce boils it will
  acquire a strong aroma. Simmer the fish until done, about 5 minutes.
  Let the dish sit for at least 15 minutes (or even as long as
  overnight in the refrigerator) so the curry flavor permeates the
  fish. Reheat, without boiling, and just before serving add the basil
  leaves and chilies. Serve over rice.
  
  RED CURRY PASTE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 5 dried red chilies, seeded, soaked
  in warm water and drained salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 2
  tsp ground caraway seeds 2 tsp ground coriander seeds 1 tsp coriander
  root (Cilantro root) 2 tsp finely chopped fresh lemon grass or 1 tsp
  dried 1 tsp finely chopped Laos root (galangal) 1 Tbs chopped

           Campbell's pork/beans
           -(2 28-oz cans)
 
  Fry all but 3 strips of bacon until crispy.  (Can do this in two
  batches in an 8-cup pyrex cup in the microwave. Try high setting for
  4 minutes, stir bacon, and cook another 2 to 4 minutes or until
  done.) Remove to paper-towel covered plate and reserve. Crumble when
  cooled.
  
  Pour out all but 1/2" of bacon grease in the bottom of the cup. Stir
  in the chopped onion and saute until clear (but not brown), stirring
  every now and then. (Probably do this on high in batches of 2
  minutes.) When onion is done, stir in the brown sugar and cook on
  high another minute or two, until the mixture is bubbly hot. Add
  mustard and maple syrup and stir to blend well.
  
  Combine beans, crumbled bacon, and sauce mixture in a large (9x14x2
  inch) baking dish.  Top with strips of raw bacon. Bake uncovered at
  350 degrees F. for an hour or so, or until the bacon is done and the
  dish is bubbly and the liquid has cooked down some. Do not cook until
  dry. Serve hot or cold.

      Title: CATHE'S BURGUNDY-MUSHROOM GRAVY
 Categories: Condiments, Holiday, Cathe
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      4 tb Butter
      1 lb Mushrooms (fresh), cleaned,
           -trimmed and sliced thinly
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      1 c  Burgundy wine
           -(or other red wine)
      4 tb Flour
     10 oz Chicken broth (canned)
      1 c  Water (more as needed)
    1/2 ts Garlic flakes, dried
 
  Melt the butter in a small pan (about 1-quart size). Add the
  mushrooms to the pan and cook over medium heat until all the liquid
  that cooks out of them has evaporated and you just have the oil from
  the butter (in the pan with the mushrooms). Stir frequently so they
  brown, but do not burn.
  
  Add the chopped onion and red wine.  Continue cooking until all the
  liquid has cooked out (you are left with just the oil from the butter
  in the pan, with the mushrooms and onions). IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT
  THERE BE NO LIQUID LEFT IN THE PAN OTHER THAN THE OIL FROM THE
  BUTTER. (The onions may cook down until you can't see them.)
  
  Add the flour to the mushroom mixture.  Stir well so that the oil
  from the butter is absorbed by the flour. Add the entire can of
  chicken broth at once and stir well. The broth and the flour/butter
  mixture should combine to make a thick liquid. This may not thicken
  until it starts to boil. Stir constantly, or the mixture will stick
  to the bottom of the pan.
  
  Add enough water to make the gravy have a consistency you like. I
  like mine thick, so a cup of water is enough. Lower the heat. Add the
  dried minced garlic and cook over low heat until the garlic flakes
  absorb enough liquid to no longer be crunchy.

  *  Created in California, 1976.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  When Cathe first gave me this recipe (mid '80s), it said to saute
  the onion in 1 T olive oil (then remove onions). Then cook only *1/2
  pound* of mushrooms in the oil, and add 1/4 t garlic salt (no garlic
  flakes). The recipe said to brown the mushrooms until no juice was
  left and mushrooms were "squeaky." Then add half the wine, cook down,
  add rest of wine, and cook down.
  
  Return onions and add just *1 tablespoon* of butter; stir in *1/4
  cup* of flour, stirring frequently, till very brown. Then it said to
  add half the chicken broth, mix well, add rest, and cook at "gentle
  bubble" till thickened.
  
  "If too thick, add up to 1/2 cup of water; cook at slow bubble till
  flour taste is gone."

      Title: CATHE'S CAJUN STUFFING
 Categories: Entrees, Holiday, Cathe
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lb Jimmy Dean sage sausage
      1 lg Bell pepper, chopped
           -into 1/4" to 1/2" pieces
           Green onions (large bunch),
           -cut into 1/4" thick pieces
           Parsley (1/3 bunch), fresh,
           -chopped finely
      2 md Celery stalks, cut
           -lengthwise into 3 sticks,
           -then cut into pieces
           -1/4" thick
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 lb Shrimp, peeled and
           -de-veined, but not cooked
  2 3/4 c  Water
      1 ts Garlic flakes (dried)
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper flakes
           -(crushed), or more to
           -taste (we use about 1 T)
      1 pk Pepperidge Farm Cornbread
           -stuffing mix (cellophane
           -bag, brown-labelled)
      1 pk Pepperidge Farm Herb
           -Stuffing Mix (cellophane
           -bag, blue-labelled)
 
  In a large pot or Dutch oven (at least 6-quart),cook the sausage over
  medium heat until lightly-browned, breaking it up into small pieces.
  Saute the vegetables in the sausage drippings in the pot with the
  cooked sausage. The vegetables will brown lightly while the sausage
  gets browner than it was. Add the butter to the pot and stir the
  pieces around until they are melted.
  
  Add the shrimp and cook for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring constantly. The
  shrimp should turn pink all over and be done, but just barely done.
  Break one in half and make sure it is opaque in the center. Turn the
  heat off, but leave the pot on the burner. Add the 2 3/4 C water, the
  dried garlic and the cayenne pepper flakes; stir well.
  
  Add both bags of stuffing mix to the liquid mixture. Blend all
  ingredients together well.  Lightly spoon the stuffing mixture into a
  greased 9" x 14" pan. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 minutes. Serve at
  once (with Burgundy mushroom gravy, if desired).

      Title: CATHE'S CLAM CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups, Cathe
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 sl Bacon (or more)
      1 lg Onion, chopped
     24 oz Clam juice, bottle
           -(Doxee brand)
    1/2 ts Garlic, dried, minced
      1 lg Potato, baking
     10 oz Baby clams, canned
           -(Orleans brand)
      3 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Half & half (or more)
           -(or cream )
      1 ts Garlic salt (Lowry's)
    1/4 ts Black pepper
 
  Fry bacon in 3-quart pan until brown.  Reserve 2 T. bacon grease in
  pan; remove bacon to paper towel to drain well. Crumble bacon and
  save it for later. (Can cook bacon in microwave and transfer 2 T
  grease to 3-quart pan.)
  
  Saute chopped onion in bacon grease until translucent. Shake one of
  the three bottles of clam juice well; add to the sauteed onion. Stir
  in dried minced garlic and let come to a boil. Boil until the liquid
  is reduced by half, but don't let the liquid get so low that the
  sauteed onion and minced garlic brown.
  
  Shake the other two bottles of clam juice well and add to the mixture
  in the pan.  Bring to boil.
  
  Scrub the baking potato well (or peel it, if you want to); cut it into
  half-inch cubes.  Add to the boiling clam juice and reduce heat (to
  low) -- so the mixture bubbles gently -- until the potatoes are
  almost done.
  
  Meanwhile, drain the baby clams, reserving the juice in a cup. Put the
  clams aside.  Stir the cornstarch into the reserved clam juice,
  blending well.
  
  When the potatoes are just barely done, remove the pan from the heat.
  Re-mix the cornstarch and clam juice and add to the soup, stirring
  constantly as you pour the cornstarch mixture into the pan. Return
  pan to heat and stir constantly until thickened. (This may seem too
  thick.) Remove from heat and stir in the baby clams and the crumbled
  bacon. Add half and half or cream until soup is the consistency you
  want it. (If you don't want it so creamy, use milk or skim milk
  instead.)
  
  Add garlic salt and black pepper to taste; serve warm. Do not let the
  soup boil once the baby clams are added; boiling will turn them into
  rubber. This makes about a quart of soup, enough to serve 4 with no
  leftovers.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  The recipe that Cathe gave me in the 70s called for only two
  bottles of clam juice (instead of three), 1/2 C half & half (instead
  of 1/4 C), 2 T cornstarch (instead of 3 T), 2 teaspoons minced garlic
  (instead of 1/2 t), 1/4 t garlic salt (instead of 1 t), and no black
  pepper or bacon (just 2 T drippings for frying).
  
  It also called for 1/4 t each lemon pepper and sweet basil, 2 t dried
  parsley, 3 drops Tabasco sauce and 1/4 C sauterne, none of which are
  called for in this recipe. The only things the same are the potato,
  the onion and the 10 oz. can for baby clams (Geisha). (The recipe
  said you could substitute a 7 oz can of minced clams if you had to.)

           -or light red beans,
           -or cranberry beans
           Water to cover
    3/4 lb Ham trimmings, lean

      6 c  Water (more as needed)
      2 c  Celery, finely chopped
      2 c  Onion, finely chopped
      2 c  Bell pepper, finely chopped
      5    Bay leaves
      2 ts White pepper

    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper, ground
           -(or more)
    1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
    1/2 ts Tabasco sauce (or more)
      2 lb Manda's sausage (spicy)
           -or Jimmy Dean Mesquite
           -link sausage, regular,
           -sliced diagonally
           -into 1/2-inch pieces
      8 c  Rice, cooked (or more)
 
  Empty the beans into a 6-quart saucepan.  Run water over them,
  washing them with your hands and picking out any stones or bad beans.
  Drain and repeat until the water runs clear and has no sand in it.
  
  Add water to the pot to cover the beans by about 4 inches. Place on a
  large burner and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat
  slightly, boil gently for 3 minutes, remove from burner and cover.
  Let the covered pot sit, unopened, for an hour.  Drain and reserve
  the beans, discarding the juice.
  
  Place the ham pieces, 2 cups of water, the chopped vegetables and
  seasonings in a 12-quart saucepan or large dutch oven. Stir well,
  cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer
  until the meat is fork tender, about an hour, stirring occasionally.
  
  Remove the meat from the pan and tear it into small pieces. Set it
  aside. (If using ham hocks, cover with water to cook. The beans will
  have to cook down longer to reach their normal consistency. You may
  not need to add any extra water.)
  
  Add the drained beans and 2 cups water to the pan with the ham broth
  and vegetables.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat and
  simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the sliced sausage and
  2 cups more water if the beans are not covered with liquid and
  continue simmering until the beans start breaking into pieces, about
  35 more minutes, stirring often to the bottom of the pan.
  
  If the beans start to scorch, do not stir.  Instead, immediately
  remove them from the heat and transfer them to another pot without
  scraping any scorched beans into the mixture. Add the ham pieces or
  hocks and cook about 10 minutes more, stirring often. Do not let the
  mixture get dried out like refried beans, but keep it thicker than
  cream soup.
  
  To serve, mound 1/2 cup cooked rice in a bowl and cover with beans,
  ham and sausage pieces.  Serves 15 to 20 as a side dish.
  
  Cathe's notes:
  
  *  Adapted from Chef Paul's, page 190
  
  *  The original recipe had approximately the same amount of
  vegetables, ham and spices as above, but had just one pound of beans.
  I added one extra pound of sausage and 2 extra pounds of beans, but
  kept everything else the same.  The original recipe had
  proportionally much more cayenne pepper and Tabasco sauce. Normally I
  would make this a lot spicier than this, but not as spicy as the
  original recipe.

  cream soup.
  
  To serve, mound 1/2 cup cooked rice in a bowl and cover with beans,
  ham and sausage pieces.  Serves 15 to 20 as a side dish.
  
  Cathe's notes:
  
  *  Adapted from Chef Paul's, page 190
  
  *  The original recipe had approximately the same amount of
  vegetables, ham and spices as above, but had just one pound of beans.
  I added one extra pound of sausage and 2 extra pounds of beans, but
  kept everything else the same.  The original recipe had
  proportionally much more cayenne pepper and Tabasco sauce. Normally I
  would make this a lot spicier than this, but not as spicy as the
  original recipe. Submitted By ARLENES@HOLLY.COLOSTATE.EDU On

      Title: CATHY'S FISH & RICE
 Categories: Rice
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb White fish (I used frozen
           Pollock), cut in
      1 sm Onion -- chopped
      3    Cloves garlic
           Handful cherry tomatoes
           -halved
           Some mushrooms -- sliced
           Flour (for dredging)
           Oil (for sauteing)
    110 ml White wine
           Curry powder
           Black pepper
           Cooked rice
 
  1.  Saute the onions in a small amount of oil till they start to
  soften. Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes, and then add the
  mushrooms and cook for a few minutes more, till they lose their raw
  look.
  
  2.  Meanwhile, put a few tablespoons of flour and the pepper into a
  plastic bag and shake the fish cubes in the bag (don't forget to
  close the bag!) Remove the fish from the bag, shaking off any excess
  flour.
  
  3.  When the vegetables are cooked to your liking, remove them from
  the pan and set them aside. You could drain them on a paper towel to
  remove a bit of the oil, but it's not necessary.
  
  4.  Add a little more oil to the pan, and heat it for a moment. Drop
  the fish pieces in the oil, and saute them till them start to turn
  opaque. Add the vegetables, the cherry tomatoes & the curry powder,
  and stir to mix them in. Pour in the white wine (or other liquid of
  your choice) and cook down till most of the liquid has evaporated.
  Serve over rice.
  
  Author's Notes: This is a recipe I made up the other night, when I
  didn't feel like going out to the store. It's not exactly haute
  cuisine, but it tasted OK, and used common ingredients. It'squick to
  prepare, and doesn't taste very fishy since the dominant flavor is
  the curry powder. (All measurements are approximate. This made more
  than enough for 2 people).
  
  The thing about this sort of recipe is that you can vary it in
  countless ways ~- add some bell peppers if you want, or add different
  spices. Use soy sauce and call it Oriental. Add a few hot chilli
  peppers for more punch.
  
  Difficulty    : easy. Precision
  : measure ingredients.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 c  Feta cheese, drained,
           Crumbled, and packed into
           The measuring cup
    1/2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
      1    Egg, beaten
      6    Bay leaves
      2 tb Honey
 
     1) Put the cheese into a medium sized mixing bowl. Mash well with
  the fingers until it becomes a smooth, lumpless paste. Add the flour
  and mix well with the fingers. Add the beaten egg and mix well. The
  dough will be rather sticky.
  
     2) Divide the dough into two equal parts, then form two round,
  flat, 1/2 inch thick loaves.  Lay each on three bay leaves set on a
  greased baking sheet, and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1
  to 1-1/2 hours, or until cooked through.
  
     3) Remove the loaves from the oven, spread the tops with the
  honey, and let cool.  Remove the bay leaves before serving. NOTE: If
  feta cheese is unavailable, use 1 cup cottage cheese and add 1/4 cup
  extra flour (but the taste is inferior).

      Title: CATO'S GRAPE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
    1/2 c  Lard, shortening, or butter
           Melted and cooled
    1/4 c  Feta cheese, crumbled and
           Mashed into a paste
      1 ts Cumin seed, ground
      1 ts Anise, ground
  1 1/2 c  Grape juice, purple or white
      1 pk Dry yeast
      8    Bay leaves
 
     1) Place the flour, lard, mashed cheese, ground cumin and anise,
  and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Blend well. Add the grape juice and
  mix the dough well for 2-3 minutes until all the grape juice is
  absorbed and evenly distributed.  The dough will be damp and sticky,
  but no internal dry areas should appear by the end of the mixing. If
  they do, mix a few minutes more or add a little more grape juice and
  mix again.
  
     2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsp. flour
  over the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured
  surface for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and
  only slightly sticky.  Add more flour if needed.  Let the dough rest
  2 minutes.
  
     3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30
  seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
  towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
  hours.
  
     4) Sprinkle top with flour, punch down, and form the dough into 4
  rectangular loaves (4 in. by 2 in. by 2-1/2 in.). Place two bay
  leaves on the bottom of each loaf, and lay them, leaf side down, on a
  greased cookie sheet.  Cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour,
  until well risen.
  
     5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until the
  loaves are brown on top and make a hollow sound when tapped on the
  bottom. Serve when cool. NOTE: To make these breads without
  leavening, omit the yeast, knead the dough thoroughly, then bake at
  350 degrees for about 2 hours. They will be chewy and moist, and very
  foreign to our taste. The Romans thought unleaven bread was manlier
  and much better for the digestion.

      Title: CATSUP [KETCHUP] HISTORY
 Categories: Hints/info
      Yield: 1 Info file
 
MMMMM--------------------------HISTORY-------------------------------
 
  KETCHUP: Also catchup, Catsup. A condiment consisting of a thick,
  smooth-textured, spicy sauce usually made from tomatoes.[Probably
  Malay kechap, fish sauce possibly from Chinese (Cantonese) ke-tsiap]
  
  Notes: The word ketchup exemplifies the types of modifications that
  can take place in the borrowing process, both in the borrowing of a
  word and in the borrowing of a substance. The source of our word
  ketchup may be the Malay word kechap, possibly taken into Malay from
  the Cantonese dialect of Chinese. Kechap, like our word, referred to
  a kind of sauce, but a sauce without tomatoes; rather, it contained
  fish brine, herbs, and spices. The sauce seems to have emigrated to
  Europe by way of sailors, where it was made with locally available
  ingredients such as the juice of mushrooms or walnuts. At some point,
  when the juice of tomatoes was first used, ketchup as we know it was
  born. However, it is important to realize that in the 18th and 19th
  centuries ketchup was a generic term for sauces whose only common
  ingredient was vinegar. The word is first recorded in English in 1690
  in the form catchup, in 1711 in the form ketchup, and in 1730 in the
  form catsup. These three spelling variants of a foreign borrowing
  remain current.

      2    Cloves garlic, finely ch.
  1 1/2 ts Grated fresh root ginger
      2 tb Roasted peanuts, finely ch.
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/4 ts Chilli powder
    1/2 ts Ground cloves

      1    Large cauliflower (about
           2lb.3oz.cut into florets)
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
 
  Toast the sesame seeds then the cumin seeds in a frypan, without any
  added oil.  The sesame seeds are ready when they are golden brown,
  and the cumin seeds when they pop, smell good, and have all heated
  through, in 1-2 minutes if you start with a hot pan. Grind the
  toasted sesame and cumin seeds, separately or mixed.
  :       Mix the toasted seeds, garlic, ginger and peanuts, adding the
  turmeric, chilli powder, ground cloves and salt, and put aside. Chop
  the onions and put them in a large pot or pan to cook in the oil.
  Cook until transparent and lightly coloured, taking care not to let
  them burn. Stir the spice mixture through the onion, then add the
  cauliflower which has been broken and cut into florets, each the size
  of a walnut.
  :       Add the lemon juice and about 1/4 cup of water, cover, and
  cook over a moderate heat , stirring and tossing the cauliflower
  occasionally, until it is tender-crisp. Add a little extra water
  during cooking if necessary.  If you find that there is liquid left
  when the cauliflower is cooked, thicken it with a little cornflour
  paste and toss the cauliflower in it. Taste and add extra salt if
  necessary. Serve with dahl, rice, a tomato salad, cucumbers in

      Title: CAULIFLOWER SOUP (MINESTRA DI CAVALFIORE)
 Categories: Italian, Soups/stews, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lg Head cauliflower
      2 tb White or cider vinegar
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      4    To 6 cloves garlic
    1/4 ts To 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes
      3 c  Hot meat broth
           Salt
    1/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      6 oz Freshly grated pecorino
           -cheese
 
  "There's probably no sense in making this soup if you don't like
  cauliflower.  As with so much Italian food, this recipe uses a few
  basic ingredients to showcase the star vegetable. A purist would even
  shudder at the cheese!  Make this soup as garlicky and spicy as you
  like but be sure to serve lots of crusty Italian bread or bruschetta
  (toasted Italian bread brushed with olive oil). When I want a soup
  with a bit more texture, I remove 1 cup of the cooked cauliflower,
  puree it, and return it to the remaining soup"
  
  Break the cauliflower florets into small (1/2 inch) pieces. Trim the
  stem end and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Wash the cauliflower in 2
  quarts of cold water blended with 2 tablespoons of vinegar.  Drain
  and drop into a large pot of boiling salted water. Boil for 4
  minutes; drain and dry well.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a soup pot; add the garlic and hot pepper, and
  cook gently until the garlic is golden. Add the cauliflower and cook
  for 5 minutes, stirring to prevent it from browning. Add the hot
  broth, salt and parsley and cook until the cauliflower is tender.
  Ladle into soup bowls and sprinkle with a generous amount of cheese.
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: CECIL'S JERK CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Spice mix
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Caribbian hot sauce -- OR
     10    Habaneros
           Pureed in 1/4 cup cheap --
           Yellow mustard
      2 tb Dried rosemary
      2 tb Dried basil
      3    Scallions
      1 ts Salt
           Juice of 2 limes
      2 tb White vinegar
      2 tb Parsley
      2 tb Dried thyme
      2 tb Mustard seed
      1 ts Black pepper
      2 tb Orange juice
      6    Chicken thighes -- w/legs
           Attached
           Chopped
 
  Combine all ingredients except chicken in food processor or blender,
  and blend into a paste, making sure that the ingredients are all fully
  integrated. The paste should be the consistency of a thick tomato
  sauce. If its too thick, thin it with a little more white vinegar.
  
  Cover the paste and let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 2
  hours, but not more that 2 weeks, for the flavors to blend together.
  Overnight is ideal.
  
  Rub the chicken with the paste and place over a very low heat. Or if
  you have a covered cooker, put the coals to one side, the chicken to
  the other and cover.
  
  Cook about 1 hr without cover  or 1/2 hr if covered. The key here is
  to use a very low heat.  Be patient. Hard to overcook, the only way
  to screw it up is if you burn the paste by having the heat to high.
  The longer the chicken stays on the grill, the more superior the
  smoky flavor. Recipe By : Cecil AT From: Western Mexican Cookbook

      3 lb Center-cut salmon, cut

           Sprigs of fresh dill
      6 tb Butter, melted
           Cedar pieces (see below)*
 
  *Untreated cedar pieces are sold by the bundle at most lumberyards
  and some hardware stores. Soak untreated cedar pieces (1 piece about
  6' x 12", 6 pieces about 3" x 6") in a pan of water overnight or
  place in a large pot of water and bring to a boil over med-high heat.
  Drain.
  
  Preheat oven to 450 F.  Place large cedar board on a foil-lined cookie
  sheet.  Season salmon with salt and pepper, then lay it on the cedar
  and slip smaller cedar pieces, a few lemon slices, and a few dill
  sprigs (reserve some lemon and dill for garnish) between each steak.
  Brush all over with butter.
  
  Roast until salmon is pink, 20-25 minutes.  Remove salmon from oven.
  Take smaller pieces of cedar out from between steaks and scatter over
  salmon, then wrap tightly with foil and set aside to finish "cooking"
  ~ and to set smoky flavor - for 15 mintues.  (For a more well-done
  fish, return wrapped salmon to oven and roast for 5 minutes.) Unwrap,
  and, when salmon is cool enough to handle, finish slicing the fish.
  Serve steaks garnished with reserved lemon slices and fresh dill, if
  desired.

    1/4 ts Coriander seeds
      2 c  Spinach leaves
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
           Peppered croutons-see recipe
 
  Melt butter in heavy large non-aluminum pot over medium heat. Add
  onion and celery and saute until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
  Add celery roots, potatoes and parsnips and saute 5 minutes. Add 3
  cups stock, bay leaf, thyme, white pepper and coriander. Bring to
  boil. Reduce heat, cover partially and simmer until vegetables are
  very soft, about 25 minutes. Discard bay leaf and thyme sprigs.  Add
  spinach to soup and cook until just wilted, stirring occasionally,
  about 2 minutes.
  
  Place soup in batches in processor.  Return soup to pot. Add cream and
  remaining 2 cups stock and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

  "The Irish excel with root vegetables, and every home garden seems to
  boast lush rows of celeriac, parsnips, turnips, leeks, rutabagas, and
  potatoes. This savory bisque is a subtle and suave use of the humble
  and often ignored celery root. Along with glasses of sherry, it makes
  a great beginning to an elegant celebration of St. Patrick. Spinach
  leaves add pretty green color to the bisque."

 Categories: Cooking liv, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
      1/2 c  diced carrot
      1/2 c  diced celery
      1/2 c  diced Spanish onion
        6 ts olive oil
        2 lg celery roots -- peeled
        3 lg Portobello mushrooms
  :          Salt and pepper
        1    clove garlic
        1    sprig rosemary
        1    stalk celery -- diced
        1 TB diced shallots
        2 TB chopped fresh herbs (e.g.
  :          parsley, chives)
        2 c  flat-leaf parsley leaves
        1    recipe Red Wine Reduction
  :          -recipe follows
  
  In a medium saucepan, caramelize the carrots, celery, and onion in 2
  teaspoons of the olive oil. Add the celery root, cover three-quarters
  of the way with water, and cover the pan. Slowly braise for 45 to 60
  minutes, or until tender. Remove the celery root from the braising
  liquid and cool completely. Reserve the braising liquid. Trim the
  celery root to square off- and slice paper thin. Clean the Portobello
  mushrooms by removing the stems and the dark brown underside. Cut
  into quarters, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with 2
  teaspoons of the olive oil. Place in an ovenproof pan with the garlic
  and rosemary and cover with aluminum foil. Bake at 350 degrees for 30
  to 40 minutes, or until tender. In a medium saute pan, saute the
  diced celery and shallot in 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Dice the
  roasted mushrooms and toss with the celery mixture and herbs. In a
  saute pan, wilt the Italian parsley in 1 teaspoon of the olive oil
  and 1 tablespoon of the braising liquid. Place the celery root slices
  on a sheet pan with a dash of the braising liquid, season with salt
  and pepper, and bake at 350 degrees for 3 to 4 minutes to reheat. Lay
  1 slice of the celery root on a plate and top with the mushroom and
  celery mixture. Place a piece of the parsley on top and cover with
  another piece of the celery root. Press the edges of the celery root
  together and place small pinches of braised Italian parsley at each
  corner. Drizzle with Red Wine Reduction around the edges of each
  plate.

      Title: CELERY ROOT SALAD
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Celery root
           -(also called celeriac)
      4 c  Water (salted), boiling
      6 tb Olive oil
      3 tb White wine vinegar
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar
  1 1/4 ts Mustard,  dry
    1/2 ts Black pepper,
           -freshly ground
      1    Garlic clove, crushed
    3/4 ts Dill weed, dried
           -(use more if fresh)
    1/3 c  Scallions, minced
    1/3 c  Parsley, minced
 
  Peel the celery root and cut it into 1/2-inch cubes. Add the cubed
  celery root to the boiling salted water and cook until tender, about
  15 minutes. Drain.
  
  Combine the rest of the ingredients and whisk or shake to make a
  dressing. Pour the dressing over the cooked celery root and toss.
  Refrigerate at least two hours before serving.
  
  Celery root (also called celeriac) is sometimes hard to find. Try to
  get ones about the size of a large fist; smaller ones have too much
  waste, and bigger ones are often pithy. This vegetable is not worth
  eating raw.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cooked celery root in vinaigrette -- This salad has an intense
  celery flavor.  The taste is so strong that it should be served only
  with other strongly flavored foods. It would overwhelm veal, but
  would go well with a lamb roast.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CELERY ROOT SALAD (SELLERIESALAT)
 Categories: Salads, German
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 md Celery root (3-inch
           -diameter), peeled,
           Washed, and thinly sliced
      1 c  Beef stock
      2 tb To 3 tb salad oil
           Wine vinegar
           Salt
      1 pn Sugar
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
 
  Put the freshly sliced celery root immediately into the stock which
  should be flavored with 1 tablespoon each oil and vinegar, 1/2
  teaspoon salt, the sugar, and the chopped onion. Cook for about 20
  minutes - until the celery root is quite tender and the liquid has
  almost boiled away. Season the celery root and beef stock with the
  remaining oil and a dash or two of wine vinegar, as well as with salt
  if you wish.
  
  Note:  If the salad is to be served as an appetizer, mix in some
  coarsely chopped walnut and garnish with a few walnut halves.
  
  Nowadays, in this age of crudites, it may be more usual to substitute
  grated uncooked celery root, marinated in oil and vinegar, and
  possibly mixed with grated raw carrot.
  
  Makes 2 - 3 cups.

  Celery Salads are easy make aheads
  
  Whether fixing family meals or planning a party menu, consider these
  easy to prepare celery salads. Crisp, colorful and quick, these
  salads can be made ahead, and to save time, start with fresh cut
  celery available at produce departments. Celery Salad a la Greece
  tastes best when it's made several hours or a day before. To
  tenderize the vegetables, first simmer in a seasoned mixture of lemon
  juice, olive oil and tarragon. Reduce the liquid. Refrigerate and use
  as a flavorful vegetable marinade. Take the sa lad from the
  refrigerator, stir and serve. Or try a crunchy celery, carrot and
  water chestnut salad. Julienne or slice celery and carrots before
  lightly cooking. Toss with sliced water chestnuts and a fragrant
  dressing of olive oil and cider vinegar blended with Dijon mustard.
  Serve immediately or marinate.
  
  In a medium saucepan, combine water, lemon juice, oil, garlic, salt
  and tarragon; bring to a boil. Add celery, carrots, red pepper and
  onion; bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until
  vegetables are crisp tender, 1012 minutes. Remove from heat; using a
  slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to a serving bowl. Place the
  saucepan over high heat; boil the liquid until it is reduced to l/2
  cup; pour liquid over vegetables; cover and refrigerate 4 hours or
  overnight before serving. Makes 4 portio ns, about
        3    l/2 cups

 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      3 c  All-purpose flour
  2 1/2 ts Celery seeds
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      3 tb Vegetable shortening
 
         About 2/3 cup water
  
  "Celery seeds are not the seeds of the celery you eat as a vegetable.
  Rather, they are the tangy fruit of a plant related to the parsley
  family. Try them with a cold glass of fruit juice mixed with club
  soda. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.
  
  Stir together the flour, celery seeds, salt, and pepper in a large
  bowl or in the food processor. Cut in the shortening until the
  mixture is the consistency of coarse meal. Add enough of the water to
  form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/8 inch thick maximum. Cut the
  dough into 2-inch circles with a cookie cutter. Arrange them on
  ungreased baking sheets.
  
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool on a rack.
  Yield: 40-50.
  
  VARIATION: Caraway seeds can be substituted for celery seeds. Grind
  the caraway seeds in a food mill before using. The caraway version of
  these crackers is delicious with cream cheese.

  stock and when boiling, turn down to a very gentle simmer. Don't

  allow to settle, as the cepes always give out a little sand, no

      1 c  Ammonia (sudsing or
           -nonsudsing)
    1/2 c  Vinegar
     14 c  Warm water
 
  Pour baking soda into a clean gallon-size plastic jug. Add ammonia,

  before it is completely full.
  
  Cover jug tightly, label and keep out of the reach of children.
  Smaller pump- type containers can be filled from the jug for small
  jobs--make sure these containers are labeled and kept safely away
  from children as well.
  
  To use:  Spray solution directly onto tile and wipe with a damp
  sponge or the kind of scrubbing pad made for Teflon pans.
  
  Hint:  If grout or tiles are especially soiled, make a past of 2 tb
  baking soda and 1 tb Ceramic Tile & Grout Cleaner (recipe above).
  Brush it onto the stains with an old toothbrush. Let past remain for
  5 minutes, then scrub off and rinse.
  
  Note: This solution contains ammonia: do not mix with anything in the
  bathroom containing bleach or dangerous fumes could result.
  
  Yield:  1 gallon
  
  This recipe safely removes the soap film that frequently forms on tile
  surfaces and between the tiles. A more concentrated paste of the
  cleaner can be made (see Hint) and left to clean stubborn stains on
  the grout.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Celeriac, scrubbed & clean
      1    Lemon
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2    Scallions trimmed & chopped

      1 ts Paprika
 
  Squeeze the juice of the lemon in a large bowl of cold water. Peel the
  cereliac and cut it into 1/4-inch-thick slices. To keep them from
  discoloring, drop the slices into the water as you work.
  
  Drain the slices put them into a saucepan add the stock. Bring to
  boil and simmer over medium heat until the cereliac is tender, 10 to
  12 minutes. Keep the liquid.
  
  Preheat the broiler.
  
  To prepare the sauce, first heat the oil in a small saucepan over
  medium heat, add the scallions and cook them until they are soft. (2
  ~ 3 minutes) Whisk the flour, cook one minute. Whisk the milk. Spoon
  the liquid from the boiled cereliac and add it to the saucepan. Cook
  the mixture whisking constantly until it thickens, about one minute.
  Stir in the Gruyere, nutmeg, salt and pepper.
  
  Place carefully the slices of cereliac in a gratin dish. Pour the
  sauce over them. Scatter the Parmesan over and sprinkle with paprika.
  Broil the dish until the top turns golden - about 2 minutes.

           Finely chopped onions

      1 md Head red cabbage
           Salt
    1/2 ts Paprika
           Fresh ground black pepper
      1 lg Apple, grated
      2 tb White [sic] vinegar
      1 tb White sugar
    1/2 ts Caraway seeds
 
  Render pork fat very slowly; remove "cracklings", & add enough finely
  chopped onion for taste and flavor. Cook until golden. Add paprika
  slowly, DON'T let it burn or smoke. Let cool, and store, covered in
  refrigerator - will keep for a long time.
  
  Wash the cabbage in cold water, quarter it & chop finely, salting as
  you go. Discard the core. Heat about 3 cups of the pork-fat/onion
  mixture, add about 1/2 teasp. paprika - don't let it burn. Add the
  wet, salty cabbage & stir until it's coated with fat. Add pepper to
  taste, grated apple, stir in; add about 2-3 tsps wine [sic] vinegar,
  1 tbsp sugar. Rub about 1 1/2 tsp caraway seeds between palms, & add
  to cabbage.
  
  This totally "handed-down-through-the-Wincenc-family" recipe will
  come out differently each time - until you arrive at the taste you
  like best. Taste as you go along! But the true test will be on the
  2nd or 3rd day when reheating the left-overs. I always loved it best
  then!!

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -HWDP78B    CHERYL GAVARD
    1/2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
      1 pk Dry active yeast
           -Combine these and let sit
           -for later use
      1 ts -warm water
        pn Saffron
      3 c  Flour; up 2 4 cups
      3 lg Eggs; or subs.
    1/3 c  Veg. oil
      3 tb Honey
      2 tb OJ
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1    Beaten egg; set aside
 
  Combine these 2  ingredients and let sit in warm place until it
  bubbles and foams. "proofing the yeast"
  
  Sift 2 1/2 cups of the flour into a glass bowl.  Make a well in the
  center and add the yeast, 3 eggs, veg. oil, honey, OJ, salt, and
  saffron. Beat either with dough hooks, or by hand until well mixed
  and a soft dough is formed.  Start to add more flour and knead it in
  until you get a non-sticky dough ball.
  
  Turn out onto floured surface and knead it for ten mins. until very
  elastic. 3-5 mins.
  
  Oil a bowl and place the dough ball in it and coat well. Cover and
  let rise in warm place for 1 1/2 hrs. Punch down. Let stand covered
  for 1 hour. Punch down.
  
  Remove to floured board and shape into a round by rolling on the board
  until it is a rope about 18-22"'s long. Curl it up and place on oiled
  sheet and cover and let stand for 1 hour or until double. Brush with
  beaten egg and bake at 375 for 15 mins. lower to 350 and bake for 25
  mins. more or until golden and hollow sounding when thumped on botton.
  
  Now if you want you can sprinkle on seeds of your choice before
  baking and after brushing with the egg. Or you can add rasins to the
  bread, by flattening it, and patting on rasins and then rolling it up
  jelly roll style and then forming  it into the round. You can also
  bake it in a braid by splitting the dough into three pieces, and
  rolling each 20 "'s long pinch one end together and "braid" the
  ropes. Pinch the other end. Then follow the directions for baking. I
  hope you all try this bread as it is relly great. It can also be used
  as Easter bread and have candied fruit added to it and then glazed
  with a powder sugar glaze and sprinkle on collored jimmies. If anyone
  bakes this bread please let me know how it goes:) TTYL

    1/2 c  Sugar
     80 sm Rounds of rice paper (banh

           -in diameter
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  This is another version of the superlative Cha Gio (also called
  Nems). The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first
  one. Boil the noodles. Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water
  until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain. Remove the stems from the
  mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid. Mince the mushrooms.
  Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a
  large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must
  be handled with care. (The water is used to soften the sheets for
  handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep
  golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with
  only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets
  covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,
  immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat
  on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice
  paper will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Press into a
  compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the
  filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F. Working in batches,
  add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or let them
  touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat for 10 to
  12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp. Remove the rolls
  with tongs and drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a low oven while
  frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in
  this recipe.
  
  To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few
  strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the
  Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham. If served as an
  hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a main
  course.
  
  NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the
  noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the
  individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground
  roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.
  
  As a quick and easy appetizer, Cha Gio can be served with just Nuoc
  Cham.
  
  Yield: about 80 spring rolls.

      4    Eggs; well beaten
      2 c  Oil, peanut
 
  Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Cut a round
  rice paper sheet into quarters. Place the cut rice paper on a flat
  surface. With a pastry brush, paint beaten egg over the entire
  surface of each of the pieces. Before filling, wait for egg mixture
  to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes about 2 minutes.
  When you become adept at this, you can work on several wrappers at a
  time. When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 tsp.
  of filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle. Fold
  the sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll. After
  filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying  pan, put
  the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate, and
  fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown. (This is
  Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).

           Peanut oil for frying
 
  The book notes that true Buddhist vegetarians would not use garlic or
  fish sauce and would limit the dips to plain soy or plum sauce.
  Unless you are in this category, Peanut Sauce (Nuoc Leo) and Nuoc
  Cham are great dips as well.
  
  Prepare the Vegetable Platter, noodles and dipping sauce. Set aside.
  
  Soak the noodles in warm water and the mushrooms in hot water for 30
  minutes; drain.  Cut the noodles into 1/2-inch lengths. Remove and
  discard the stems from the mushrooms; squeeze to extract most of the
  soaking liquid.  Mince all of the mushrooms.
  
  Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl; blend
  well with your hands.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a large bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.
  
  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with only 4 sheets at a time,
  keeping the remaining sheets covered with a barely damp cloth to
  prevent curling.
  
  Immerse the rice paper, one sheet at a time, into the sweetened warm
  water. Quickly withdraw it and lay it flat on a dry towel. Do this
  with 4 sheets without letting them touch each other. The rice paper
  will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold over the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Press it into a
  compact rectangle.  Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side.  Roll from the bottom to the top to completely
  enclose the filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used. (The
  rolls can be prepared 1 day in advance.  Wrap and refrigerate.)
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible use 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 inches
  of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F. Working in batches, add
  some of the rolls without letting them touch, or they will stick
  together. Fry for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and
  crisp. Remove the rolls from the oil with tongs and drain on paper
  towels. Keep warm in a low oven until all of th rolls are cooked.
  
  To serve, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with some
  noodles and selected items from the Vegetable Platter and dips the
  package in the dipping sauce.
  
  NOTE:  The fried rolls can be frozen, then thawed and reheated in a
  350F oven just to crisp and heat through.
  
  Yield: 40 rolls.

    1/2 md Onion, minced
      1 c  Fresh bean sprouts
      2 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Egg

MMMMM-------------------ASSEMBLING AND FRYING------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     24    Rounds of rice paper (banh
           -trang) each 8 1/2 inches
           -in diameter.
     24    Raw medium shrimp, peeled
           -with tail section
           -attached, deveined
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes a
  recipe for Fried Shrimp Rolls!!!  These triangular little goodies are
  great when served alongside Cha Gio. These are *really* good! Prepare
  the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.
  
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile. Work with
  only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a
  barely damp cloth to prevent curling.
  
  Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water. Remove and spread
  flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it
  out without touching the other round. The rice papers will become
  pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Place 1 shrimp in
  the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.
  Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press
  into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it
  is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely
  and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold
  the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle. The completed
  roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers
  in the same manner.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will
  stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning
  often until crisp and golden brown. Drain the rolls on paper towels.
  Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and
  coriander leaves.
  
  NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F
  oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.
  
  Yield: 24 shrimp rolls.

      Title: CHA QUE (CINNAMON PATE)
 Categories: Vietnam, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Appetizer
 
      1 lb Boneless pork (weight after
           -trimming fat), preferable
           -fresh ham
      3 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      3 tb Water
    1/2 tb Potato starch or rice flour
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
        ds MSG (optional)
           Sprinkling of freshly
           -ground black pepper
      2 oz Pork fat
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  This recipe is very tasty with an interesting texture. Unless you're
  a fan of hard work, use a food processor. The pate was originally
  pounded to the proper consistency in a mortar and pestle...  It can
  be used all sorts of ways++made into balls for soup, sliced after
  cooking and added to lettuce or rice paper rolls, served with shrimp
  chips for munchies++whatever inspires you.  The cinnamon flavor is
  discernible but not overpowering. I've actually made this recipe and
  found it to be a keeper.
  
  Be sure pork is trimmed of all fat.  Slice the meat 1/4 inch thick,
  then cut into 1 inch squares.  Make a marinade by combining all the
  remaining ingredients, except for the pork fat and cinnamon, in a
  large bowl. Add the pork slices to the marinade and mix well with
  your hands, then cover the bowl with wrap or foil. Refrigerate for 5
  hours, and after that period of time has elapsed, transfer the bowl
  to the freezer for 10 minutes.
  
  Remove the pork from the freezer, add the cinnamon, and reduce to a
  paste in a food processor only.
  
  Boil the pork fat for 10 minutes and dice into small pieces, the size
  of whole peppercorns.  Add the diced pork fat to the ground pork
  mixture.
  
  Coat an 8-inch-square baking pan with oil.  Put the meat paste into
  the pan and press down firmly with your hands, making sure the
  surface is smooth. The meat will come halfway up the side of the pan.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F and bake the pate for 40 minutes or until the
  surface looks brown.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Then
  slice and serve as an appetizer or with French bread for lunch or
  dinner, or use in any recipe where it is required.  It can be eaten
  hot or cold.
  
  This will keep fresh in the refrigerator for a week, or it can be
  stored for a longer period in the freezer. To reheat, wrap in foil
  and place in a 300F oven for 15 minutes.

 Categories: Pork, Barbeque
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Boneless pork butt

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      2 tb Chicken stock
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Soybean condiment
           (mein see*)
      1    Lrg. clove garlic, crushed
      1 tb Chinese rice wine or
           -dry sherry
  1 1/2 tb Honey
    3/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Hoisin sauce
           Few drops of red
           -food coloring
 
   Cut the pork into long strips 1 1/2 to 2 inches square. Mix all for
  the marinade and marinate the meat for 3 hrs., unrefrigerated, or 6
  hrs. in the refrigerator.  Turn the strips every hour or so.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350^.  Place a large cake pan half filled with
  water on the lowest shelf of your oven. This will catch drips from
  the meat and prevent smoking. Place the meat strips directly on an
  oven rack and put in the top position of the oven. Be sure that all
  of the meat is over the dripping pan. Roast for 45 minutes without
  disturbing the meat. Then, turn the heat up to 450^ and roast for an
  additional 15 minutes or until the pork strips are crisp and a rich
  brown color. Slice the meat and serve it hot or cold... or use in
  other dishes as directed.
  
  *Mein See:  The remains of the process of making soy sauce. Very rich
  soybean condiment used in many Chinese dishes. Can be found in
  Oriental markets under this name or soybean jam or condiment.
  Refrigerate after opening.

      Title: CHA SHU BOW
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 12 SERVINGS--------------------------
      1 ea Pk Active dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water (abt. 110 degree)
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ea Tb Salad oil
      1 ts Salt
      3 c  All-purpose flour; unsifted,
           - (about)
           Pork filling (directions
           - follow)
 
  DIRECTIONS: In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water; blend in sugar,
  oil and Salt. Let stand in a warm place until bubbly (about 15 mins).
  Add flour and mix until dough holds together. Place dough on a
  lightly floured board and knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to
  10 mins). Place in a greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place
  until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour 15 mins). Meanwhile, prepare pork
  filling; let cool and set aside. Turn dough out onto a lightly
  floured board and knead for 1 min. Shape into a rectangle. With a
  floured knife, cut rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise 6
  times to make 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a round about 4
  1/2" in diameter. Press outside edges of dough to make them slightly
  thinner that the rest of the round. Place about 2 tbsp of filling in
  center of each round. Pull edges of dough up around filling and twist
  to seal. Place each bun, sealed side down, on a 3" square of foil.
  Cover and let rise in a warm place until puffy and light (about 30
  mins). Set in steamer over boiling water. Cover and steam for 12 to
  15 mins. (when done, tops of buns should be glazed and smooth). Serve
  warm.
  
  Pork Filling: Cut 1 1/2 lbs boneless lean pork into 1/2" cubes.
  Season with 2 cloves garlic (minced), 1/2 tsp grated fresh ginger, 2
  tsp sugar and 2 tbsp Chinese soy sauce. In a bowl, combine 2 tsp
  sugar, 1 tbsp cornstarch, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp dry sherry and 1/4
  cup water; reserve. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok or wide frying pan over
  high heat. When oil is hot, add pork and stirfry until browned (about
  5 mins). Add 1 medium size chopped onion and continue to stir frying
  until onion is limp (about 2 mins). Stir cornstarch mixture, add to
  pork and cook, stirring, until sauce bubbly and thickens. Cool.

  off egg-sized pieces, and pat into 3 inch circles. 7. Place 1
  tablespoon of pork mixture in the center of each circle. Bring two
  opposite dough edges over the mixture and seal.  Cut off excess dough
  from the remaining sides, leaving enough to seal in the pork. Gently
  seal the sides and tuck under along the seam, forming mineature
  loaves. 8. Cover and let rise for 15 to 20 minutes. 9. Over boiling
  water, place the buns well apart in a steamer basket to allow for
  expansion. Cover and steam for 5 to 10 minutes or until the surface
  glistens and is firm to the touch.
   Serve warm. Makes 10 to 12 buns.

   Cook over medium high heat until sauce thickens. Stir in the diced
  pork and onion flakes. Chill 3-4 hours.
   WRAPPING: Divide filling into 24 portions. Divide dough into 24
  balls. Slightly flatten each ball then roll out into 4-inch discs,
  leaving the center of the disc twice as thick as the side. Place 1
  portion of the filling in the center of the dough. Gather up the
  sides around the filling and twist dough to seal.
   Place on a 2 inch square piece of wax paper, twist side down. Put the
  wrapped buns at least 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet and allow the
  buns to rise in a draft-free place (the oven) for another hour.
   STEAMING: Steam for 15 minutes. Turn heat off and let the steam
  subside before lifting the cover. BAKING: Cha Siu Bow can also be
  baked. Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Set buns 2 inches apart on cookie
  sheet.
   Brush with a mixture of 1 beaten egg white, 1 tsp.
   water and 1/4 tsp. sugar. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden
  brown. Brush with melted butter. DO AHEAD NOTES: Cook and freeze.
  Reheat by steaming if steam-cooked originally. Steam frozen buns for
  1/2 hour to reheat. If baked, thaw and wrap buns in foil or cover pan
  with foil and reheat in slow oven for 1/2 hour.
  
   COMMENTS: A good filling should have some pork fat mixed in with the
  lean meat. Most importantly, Cha Siu Bow filling should be very
  juicy. That's why Ms. Yee uses so much liquid in the sauce mixture.
  By chilling the filling thoroughly, the sauce, which is very thick,
  adheres to the filling much better. Ideally, when you make the
  barbecued pork, you should try to save the pork drippings and use
  them as part of the sauce mixture. Ms. Yee deliberately leaves the
  center of the dough a bit thick because, if you roll it out to an
  even thickness, the top of the bun will ended up being too thin in
  comparison to the bottom due to of the way the dough is wrapped. In a
  pinch, you may use frozen bread dough as a substitute. However,
  frozen dough works best when baked. It does not steam well.

      Title: CHA SUI BAO (BAKED BARBECUED PORK BUNS)
 Categories: China, Ham/pork
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      1 tb Grated ginger
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Sugar
    3/4 c  Water
      1 tb Peanut or corn oil
      1 c  Finely chopped onion
      3 c  Cantonese barbecue pork, in
           -1/2-inch dice (about 1-lb.)
      1 tb Cornstarch mixed with 1
           -tablespoon water
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2    Egg yolks
      2 tb Water
      1 ts Sugar
           Chinese Baked Sweet Bread
           -Dough (recipe follows)
      1 pk Active dry yeast (1
           -tablespoon)
      3 tb Sugar
      1 c  Warm milk (100 to 110)
      1    Egg
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour, + more
           -for dusting and kneading
 
  Reheat in a 350 degree F. oven for 5 minutes, or microwave at high
  about 1 minute.
  
  Prepare bread dough. Cut out twenty 3-inch squares of parchment
  paper. Mix together ginger, oyster sauce, hoisin, dark soy, sugar and
  water in a bowl.
  
  Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot, add onion;
  stir-fry until soft. Don't brown. Add pork and stir-fry 30 seconds.
  Pour in sauce mixture, bring to a boil. Stir cornstarch/water into a
  smooth mixture. Add to pork; cook, stirring until thick, about 15
  seconds. Add sesame oil. Remove to bowl; refrigerate until thoroughly
  chilled.
  
  Cut dough in half. Form each half into a 12-inch long log; cut into 10
  pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch circle. Roll outer inch of each
  circle 1/8-inch thin; leave middle slightly thicker.
  
  If right-handed, place a dough circle in palm of your left hand. Put
  a big tablespoon of pork mixture in the ; middle; put left thumb over
  the pork. With your right hand, bring up edge and make a pleat in it.
  Rotate circle a little and make a second pleat. As you make each
  pleat, gently pull it up and around as if to enclose your thumb.
  Continue rotating, pleating and pinching, then gently twist into a
  spiral. Pinch to seal. Place bun pleated side down on a parchment
  square. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Put buns 1 1/2
  inches apart on a baking sheet. Let rise until doubled in size, 30
  minutes to 1 hour.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat egg yolks with water and sugar;
  brush over buns. Bake 20 minutes.
  
  Makes 20 buns.
  
  CHINESE BAKED SWEET BREAD DOUGH
  
  Chinese bread dough is quite sweet compared with Western breads (the
  further south you go in China, the sweeter the dough becomes). Most
  Chinese breads are steamed, which is why they look pale and uncooked
  to the Western eye.
  
  Put the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Add 1/4
  cup of the warm milk. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir to dissolve. If
  should foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh
  package of yeast. Stir in the egg, oil and remaining milk.
  
  Put the flour and remaining sugar in the work bowl of a food processor
  fitted with the metal blade. Process 2 seconds. With the machine
  running, pour the warm milk mixture down the feed tube in a steady
  stream. Process until it forms a rough ball. If ball is sticky and
  wet, add a little more flour. Process a few seconds longer, or until
  dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove dough to a
  lightly floured board.
  
  Knead dough, dusting with flour to keep it from sticking, until
  smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a large oiled bowl,
  cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled,
  about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down dough and place on a lightly floured surface. It is now
  ready to form into rolls, buns or loaves.
  
  Makes enough for 20 barbecued pork buns. Joyce Jue, San Francisco

  Preheat pot with boiling water and allow to steep 6 to 8 minutes
  before straining.

      3    In piece of fresh ginger
           Peeled and coarsely chopped
      3 tb Peeled and coarsely chopped
           Garlic
      6    8 lamb chops from the ribs,
           Remove all extra fat
      8 fl Oz grated or finely chopped
           Tomatoes
      2 md Sized onions very finely
           Chopped
      1 tb Cayenne
     12 fl Oz Greek yoghurt beaten
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground roasted cumin seeds
      1    2 tsps Punjabi garam masala
      3 tb Lemon juice
      2    3 tbsps chopped fresh green
           Coriander
 
  Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender
  with 2-3 tablespoons of water and blend to a paste.
  
  Put the chops, tomatoes, onions, cayenne pepper, yoghurt, salt and
  ginger-garlic paste into a large wok or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir
  and bring to the boil. Turn the heat to low, cover and simmer for 50
  minutes or until the chops are almost cooked. Add the cumin seeds and
  simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until the meat is tender and the sauce
  thick. Add the garam masala and lemon juice and stir.
  
  Sprinkle fresh coriander over the top and serve.
  
  TIPS
  
  In the Punjab, tomatoes are grated to make a puree - don't be tempted
  to use ready-prepared tomato puree instead of fresh.
  
  The spice combinations in garam masala vary in different parts of
  India. In the Punjab this one which you can try making yourself is
  common: 5 tbsps coriander seeds, 3 tbsps cumin seeds, 2 1/2 tbsps
  black peppercorns, 2 1/2 black cardamom seeds, 2 in cinnamon stick,
  4-5 cloves, 1/6 nutmeg. Put the coriander and the cumin into a
  cast-iron frying-pan over a medium heat. Stir until lightly roasted.
  Allow to cool. Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee
  grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.
  
  Madhur Jaffrey's Flavours of India - Punjab
  
  This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state
  now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more
  important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are
  accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried
  paratha layered with ghee (clarified butter).
  
  Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the
  only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his
  bread! You of course, can serve this dish with plain boiled rice.

      2    Egg yolks
      1 tb Water

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 tb Sesame seeds
 
      Place the water, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty
  electric mixer (KitchenAid K5A2 model works best). Stir to dissolve
  the sugar. Add the yeast and stir to dissolve. Stir in the beaten
  eggs and the oil. Beat in 5 cups of the weighed-out flour to make a
  batter. Beat for 5 minutes or until the batter begins to pull away
  from the sides of the bowl. Knead in the remaining flour by machine
  until smooth. Place the dough on a clean countertop and cover it with
  a large metal bowl. Allow the dough to rise until double in bulk.
      Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. Punch the dough
  down again and divide it in half. Cut each half into thirds. Roll 3
  of the pieces into ropes about 16 inches long with your hands. Join 1
  end of each rope and press together with the heel of your hand.
  Alternately, braid the 3 ropse together and press the other 3 ends
  together with the heel of your hand..
      Sprinkle a large baking sheet with a little of the cornmeal.
  Place the braided dough on the sheet pan and allow it to double in
  bulk again. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Allow the
  dough to rise until double in bulk.
      Beat the 2 egg yolks and 1 tablespoon of water together for the
  egg wash. Lightly brush both risen braided doughs. Sprinkle with
  sesame seeds.

      Title: CHALLAH
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 pk Yeast
  1 1/3 c  Warm water (110-115)
      1 tb Granulated sugar
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Softened butter/margerine
      3 ea Large eggs lightly beaten
      6 c  Unleached white flour
      1 ea Egg, well beaten
      1 x  With 1 Tablespoon water (a w
      1 x  Poppy seeds
 
  Add 1 Tablespoon sugar and yeast to warm water, stir well and "proof"
  the yeast (I'm old-fashioned and still do this). After the yeast
  proofs, add rest of the sugar, butter/margerine, 3 lightly beaten
  eggs, and five cups flour.  As your stir together, add salt (done
  this way because salt can kill yeast if added directly). Beat
  ingredients with a spoon, gradually adding flour, until dough is
  stiff.  Knead on board until dough is smooth and elastic (8-10mins).
    Cover and let rise in warm place -- until about doubled in size
  (1.5-2hrs).
    Punch down and knead dough until all the bubbles are gone. Divide
  into 6 parts, roll each part between your hands into a rope about 1"
  in diameter. Braid 3 ropes each into 2 loaves. Place two braids about
  6" apart on a buttered/margerined cookie sheet, and allow to raise in
  a warm place until almost doubled in size. Brush tops with egg/water
  wash and sprinkle lightly with poppy seeds.  Bake in pre-heated 400
  oven for 35-40 mins, or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Cool
  covered with a soft towel on racks.

  Beat the eggs together with cream, half-and-half, or milk. Beat in
  cinnamon and salt. Melt the butter in a large frying pan. Dip the
  challah slices, one at a time, into the egg mixture, making sure that
  each slice is well coated. The challah should absorb a little of the
  egg mixture but not enough to get soggy. Fry each battered challah
  slice for 2-3 minutes on each side until they are golden brown. Don't
  fry too fast or the inside will be wet and gooey. Serve with your
  favorite jam, maple syrup, honey, cinnamon, sugar, or plain. NOTE:
  Heavy cream really is the best liquid to use in this recipe.

      Title: CHALLAH I
 Categories: Breads, Jewish
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
  2 1/4 c  Water
      1 tb Yeast (active),
           -dry (one package)
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Salt (optional)
    1/4 c  Oil
      2    Eggs, beaten
     10 c  Flour (or less)
      1    Egg yolk
      1 tb Water
 
  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in lukewarm water (105 degrees F.).
  (Lukewarm water feels neither hot nor cold when a drop is placed on
  your wrist.) Let sit for 10 minutes to proof the yeast. If there are
  no bubbles in the water after this time, the yeast is inactive and
  you should start over with new yeast.
  
  Add the salt (optional), oil, eggs and most of the flour to the 2 1/4
  cups of water. Mix. Place dough on floured board and knead for 5-10
  minutes.
  
  Place dough in a clean bowl, brush some oil on the top (optional) and
  cover the bowl with a towel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled,
  about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Punch the dough down and let rise until doubled again (maybe another
  hour).
  
  Punch dough down and place onto floured board.  Form into two loaves.
  You can make normal loaves, or you can cut the dough and braid (with
  three or six pieces per loaf), or you can make braided or un-braided
  rolls, or you can roll the dough out until it's about 1/4 inch thick
  and then spread fried onions over it. Place loaves into oiled pans.
  
  Cover pans and let rise for about 30 minutes.  (Skip this step if
  you've rolled the dough out and covered with onions.)
  
  Mix the egg yolk with about 1 tablespoon of water. Brush loaves with
  this mixture.  (Again, skip this if you've rolled the dough out.)
  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 20 minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees
  F. and bake for 40 additional minutes. If you are making rolls, you
  probably need to bake for a total of 20-25 minutes.
  
  You can add poppy or sesame seeds to the dough, or you can sprinkle
  the seeds on top. This bread is traditionally made with white flour,
  but is still good if made with all or part whole wheat flour. I think
  its good taste comes from the oil and eggs in the dough.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Challah is a traditional Jewish bread that is part of many
  festivals, including sabbath dinners and weddings. For making a
  wedding loaf, this recipe can be doubled and used to make one braided
  loaf. It will fill up the entire oven, and you will have to find a
  cookie sheet big enough to put the loaf on. Yield: 2 loaves.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, as bread goes.
  : Time:  preparation:  3-5 hours (including rising); baking: 1 hour.
  : Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      2    Egg yolks
      5 ts Water
 
  Dissolve the yeast with the warm water and sugar.  Add the rest of the
  sugar, butter, salt, honey, raisins and eggs. Add the flour, a cup at
  a time, until it is hard to stir.
  
  Turn out onto a well-floured counter and knead until smooth and
  blistery, adding more flour as necessary (about 10-15 minutes). Put
  into greased bowl, cover, and let rise until double, about 1 hr.
  
  Punch down.  Separate into 4 sections and separate each section into
  3 more sections. Roll each piece out to the size of your cookie
  sheet. Braid 3 strands together and place on cookie sheet. Let rise
  until double (about 1 hour).
  
  Mix egg yolks and water for glaze.  Spread on loaves. Bake in a
  preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 15-30 minutes until there is a
  golden crust.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Jewish egg bread -- This is my family's version of Challah. It
  calls for saffron, but I've never actually made it as such (Hey, I'm
  just a poor college student, I can't afford saffron).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, if you know how to make bread
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours rising, 30 minutes
  cooking : Precision:  Raisins are to taste. Measure the rest of the
  ingredients.

 Categories: Breads, Jewish
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
    1/2 oz Yeast (active),
           -dry (2 packages)
      2 c  Water, warm
      4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
      3 lg Eggs
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil
           -(up to about 1/4 cup
           -more, to taste)
      9 c  Flour, all-purpose
           -(more if needed)

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1 lg Egg
           Sesame or poppy seeds
 
  Mix yeast in warm water.  Let sit 5 minutes.  In a large bowl combine
  salt, sugar, eggs and oil.  Add yeast mixture. Slowly add flour,
  stirring until not too sticky. When the dough becomes too thick to
  stir, turn it out onto a floured board and knead, adding flour as
  necessary. Scrape the working surface with a plastic dough spatula
  from time to time, to keep a dry skin from forming on it.  You may
  find that you need more flour, but don't add too much more, or the
  dough will become heavy. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic
  (about 10 minutes).
  
  Form dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled large bowl,
  turning to coat the dough with oil.  A ceramic bowl is best. Cover
  the bowl with a clean cloth and leave in a warm, draft-free place to
  rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. After the dough has
  risen, punch it down and divide it into 6 balls. Let the dough balls
  sit for 5 minutes, covered.
  
  Keeping dough balls covered while working, remove a ball and roll it
  between your hands (or on working surface) into a cord about 1 inch
  wide by about 20 inches long. The dough is quite elastic, making it
  nicely workable, yet also tending to make it shrink back slightly
  after being lengthened.  I find it best to lengthen it in a series of
  passes. Form 3 cords this way, and then start from the middle and
  braid them into a single loaf.  Tuck the ends under. It's a little
  harder to figure out how to start braiding from the middle, but the
  loaves come out more even and attractive that way.  Don't pull the
  cords while braiding. Place the loaf on a lightly oiled baking sheet,
  and cover it with a cloth while you form the other loaf.  Keep the
  loaves well apart on the baking sheet, since they will expand a lot.
  Cover the loaves and place again into a warm, draft-free place to
  rise for 45-60 minutes.
  
  After the loaves have risen, gently brush the tops with beaten egg
  using a soft brush, and then sprinkle with the seeds. Bake at 350
  degrees F. for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.

      Title: CHALLAH II~ PART 2 OF 2
 Categories: Breads, Jewish
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
           See Part 1
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Challah (pronounced "hallah") is a type of braided egg bread
  traditionally eaten on the Jewish Sabbath. It is eaten by tearing off
  hunks rather than by cutting with a knife.
  
  I got this recipe from a housemate a couple of years ago; I don't
  know its origins before that, but it has become one of my favorite
  recipes, and one with which I have experimented a good deal. I've
  tried several other challah recipes, but find I like this one the
  best. Yield: 2 Large loaves.
  
  *  The variation in oil makes quite a difference in the moisture of
  the bread: If you use the larger quantity, the bread comes out very
  nice and moist, but when it cools it becomes somewhat oily.
  
  The amounts of sugar and oil may sound high, but try it this way once
  before cutting back. I have tried other recipes that use less, and
  they don't taste nearly as good.
  
  *  Here's the fun part --> variations.  Because this dough is so
  workable, you can form it many different ways, limited only by your
  imagination; I once made a whole collection of different shapes and
  sizes, for a festive dinner party.
  
  Some of the variations I have tried include:
  
  :  o  Adding extra ingredients, such as raisins and/or nuts
  :  o  Forming the braided loaf into a wreath-like loop (joining the
  ends) :  o  Braiding 5 ways instead of 3
  :  o  Baking a small loaf on top of a larger loaf (traditional)
  :  o  Braiding 3 braided loaves into a recursive loaf (didn't turn out
  well; it ended up looking knotty, rather than intricate, and being
  somewhat tough)
  :  o  Varying the loaf sizes.  One time I made individual-sized
  loaves, so that everyone could have their own loaf at dinner. Another
  time, I divided the dough into 2 halves, set one aside, and made a
  loaf out of the other half. Then, I divided the remaining piece into
  2 halves, and continued the process until I had an array of loaves,
  each half the size of the previous. I managed to get 9 loaves by
  doing this, the smallest of which was about 1/4 inch by about 2
  inches.
  
  :  o  Varying the length-to-width proportions; traditionally, challah
  loaves are quite wide relative to their length. I find that shorter,
  wider loaves are doughier (and thus tastier), but longer loaves look
  more elegant.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes dough preparation, 1 1/2 hours first rising, 1
  hour loaf forming, 1 hour second rising, 30 minutes baking. Total: 4
  1/2 hours. : Precision: Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHALLAH OR KOILITCH+
 Categories: Breads, Jewish, Heirloom
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 pk Yeast
      1 tb Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Tepid water
  4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb All-purpose flour
      2 ts Salt
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
      2 tb Butter, melted
      1    Egg yolk
           Poppy seeds
 
  Method: Combine the yeast and sugar in the mixing bowl of a table top
  mixer and dissolve in 1-1/4 cup tepid water.  In a large mixing bowl,
  sift together the flour and the salt.  Add the eggs and melted and
  cooled butter and 2/3 of the flour mixture to the yeast mixture.  Mix
  at speed 2 for 2 minutes, then add the flour up to the point that the
  dough leaves the sides of the bowl.  Grease large bowl and place the
  dough in it turning to grease the top.  Cover with a kitchen towel.
  Let rise in a draftless warm place for approximately 1 hour.  Take
  2/3 of the dough and make a braid with it about 1 foot long.  Place
  it on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Put kitty-corner, squarely in
  the middle. Brush braid with the egg yolk. Take the rest of the dough
  and make a smaller braid only 10 inches long. Take the side of your
  hand and press firmly along the top of the larger braid (to keep
  smaller braid in place as it is baking). Place smaller braid on top.
  Brush the top braid with egg yolk and sprinkle liberally with poppy
  seeds.
  
  Let rise in a warm place again, about 40 minutes; don't let it rise
  too much.  Bake in preheated oven at 375 degrees F. for 40 to 45
  minutes. Check after about 25 minutes to see that it isn't getting
  too dark. If it is, place a piece of foil over it for the balance of
  the baking time. Wrap leftovers, if any, in wax paper.

      Title: CHALLAH WITH SAFFRON
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Packages dry yeast
      5 c  Bread or all-purpose flour
      2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Butter or margarine,
           -room temperature
      1 c  Hot water (120-130 )
      1 pn Saffron
      3    Eggs
      1    Egg white
      1    Egg yolk beaten, mixed with
      2 tb Sugar, and
      1 ts Cold water
      1 ts Poppy seeds
      1 lg Baking sheet, greased
 
  In a large mixing bowl combine the yeast, 2 cups flour, sugar, salt,
  and butter or margarine. Gradually add the hot water and beat
  forcefully by hand or at medium speed using the mixer flat beater,
  for 2 minutes. Scrape the bowl occasionally.  Add the saffron, eggs
  and egg white (reserving the yolk). The batter will be thick. Beat at
  high speed for 2 minutes. Continue to add flour with a wooden spoon
  or change to a dough hook in the mixer. Add about 3 additional cups
  of flour, one at a time, until the rough mass is no longer sticky. If
  it continues to be moist, add small amounts of flour until the dough
  cleans the sides of the bowl.
  
  Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until it is smooth and
  elastic, about 10 minutes.
  
  Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap
  and set aside until it has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Remove plastic wrap, punch the dough down and knead out the bubbles.
  Divide the dough in half. To braid, divide each half into three equal
  pieces. Under your palms roll each into a 12" length. Lay the rolls
  parallel to each other. Start the braid in the middle and work to one
  end. Pinch the end securely together. Turn around and complete the
  other end. Repeat with the other dough half. Carefully brush the
  braids with the egg glaze. Sprinkle liberally with poppy seeds. Don't
  cover the braids for the second rise. They will double in bulk in
  about an hour. Preheat oven to 400 before baking. Bake until the
  braids are shiny brown, 30 to 40 minutes, and test done when a
  toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry and clean. Carefully
  remove the bread from the baking sheet and cool on wire racks. A long
  braided loaf fresh from the oven is fragile and should be moved with
  care (and a spatula under it's bottom). Do not cut until it has
  cooled and firmed a bit.

      Title: CHALLAH~ FAVORITE RECIPE
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Cold water
      2 pk Dry yeast
      2 ts Salt
      6 tb Butter or Margarine
    1/2 c  Sugar (+ 1 T if desired)
      3    Eggs
      7 c  Unbleached flour (approx.)
      1    Egg yold mixed w/ 1 T water
  1 1/2 c  Golden raising (optional)
 
   In large bowl of electric mixer, thoroughly mix undissolved yeast
  with 1/3 of the flour and all other dry ingredients. In a 2 to 4 cup
  measure, start with 1 1/4 cups cold water. Add margarine, then add
  enough water to make 2 cups liquid.  Heat liquids with margarine over
  low heat unitl very warm, 110 to 120 degrees. Margarine does not need
  to melt. Add liquids to dry ingredients.  Beat for 2 minutes at
  medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add about
  1/2 cup flour, or enough flour to make a thick batter. Add the 3 eggs
  one at a time. Beat on high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl
  occasionally. Use dough hook or wooden spoon to stir, adding all but
  one cup of flour or as much as is needed to make elastic dough.
  Amount will vary according to temperature and humidity of room.  If
  raisins are used, add here and stir thoroughly. Turn dough out on
  floured surface, kneading until it becomes smooth and satiny to the
  touch. Add more flour if needed. Place dough in well-greased bowl,
  turning to grease top of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise
  until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down. Return to
  lightly floured board. Cut into desired amount of loaves. This recipe
  makes 1 very large, 2 large or 3 medium loaves. Cut amount of dough
  desired. Stretch into one strand and twist to form a crown.
  Paint egg mixture. Repeat with remaining dough. Tops may be sprinkled
  with sesame or poppy seeds. After bread has risen for about an hour,
  brush any dry areas with egg wash. Prick any air bubbles. Bake in
  375-degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until browned. A flick of
  finger should produce a hollow sound. Remove to rack to cool. Challah
  freezes well but should be thoroughly cooled before wrapping in heavy
  foil.

      Title: CHALUPA
 Categories: Entrees, Mexican, Crockpot
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Pinto beans
      3 lb Pork roast
      7 c  Water
    1/2 c  Onion, chopped
      2    Garlic cloves,
           -minced
      1 tb Salt
      2 tb Chili powder
      1 tb Cumin
      1 ts Oregano
      4 oz Green chili peppers,
           -chopped (one can)
 
  Put all ingredients in a dutch oven, an electric crockery cooker, or a
  heavy kettle. Cover and simmer about 5 hours, or until the roast falls
  apart and the beans are done. Uncover and cook about 1/2 hour, until
  the desired thickness is achieved.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Mexican meat and bean dish, similar to chili -- I got this
  recipe from "A Primer on Bean Cookery" by the California Dry Bean
  Advisory Board. While not a true chili, chalupa is a Mexican-American
  favorite for a hearty lunch or supper. It may be made ahead and
  reheated, and it freezes well.
  
  *  Chili powder is a mixture of spices, consisting mainly of ground
  dried chili peppers.  This recipe may be served with corn chips and
  condiments (including chopped tomato, chopped avocado, chopped onion,
  shredded lettuce, grated cheddar cheese and hot sauce).
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 5-6 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHALUPAS
 Categories: Entrees, Tex-mex
      Yield: 12 Chalupas
 
           Vegetable oil
     12    Corn tortillas (the
           -thinner the better)
      6 c  Frijoles refritos
           -(or less)
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese
           -(sharp), grated
      1 lg Tomato, chopped
      3 c  Lettuce, shredded
 
  In a small skillet, heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil. Test the
  oil for proper temperature by putting in a small piece of tortilla.
  When the oil reaches the temperature where it immediately begins to
  bubble frantically over the tortilla as soon as it is put in the oil
  and the tortilla piece becomes crisp quite quickly, you are ready to
  cook the chalupa shells. This is important because there is nothing
  worse than a soggy chalupa shell which results from the oil not being
  hot enough.
  
  Fry tortillas completely flat on both sides until very crisp. Drain
  and keep warm on a newspaper-covered cookie sheet in a warm oven.
  
  Spread about 1/4-inch thick layer of refried beans on each fried
  tortilla. Top with a generous amount of grated sharp Cheddar cheese
  and about 1 T chopped onion.
  
  Place assembled chalupas on a cookie sheet and brown under broiler
  until cheese melts.  Watch them carefully under the broiler, they can
  burn quite quickly.  Top with shredded lettuce and tomato and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tex-Mex style tostada -- You will need to first make a batch of
  frijoles refritos.  This dish is more properly known in Mexico as
  tostadas.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes, plus preparation time of frijoles refritos.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

                         - General Information -
  
  "If you pick up a half-dozen herb books to look up chamomile, you are
  likely to find a bewilderment of names. There's Roman (or English)
  chamomile, a perennial, and German (or Hungarian) chamomile, an
  annual. The German species might be listed as Matricaria chamomile,
  Chamomilla recutita, or Matricaria recutita. These are all the same
  plant! Roman chamomile is referred to in some sources as Anthemis
  nobilis, in others as Chamaemelum nobile. The currently accepted
  nomenclature is Matricaria recutita for the German, and Chamaemelum
  nobile for the Roman.
  
  "The word chamomile (sometimes spelled camomile, and generally
  pronounced with a long i), is derived from Greek - chamos (ground)
  and melos (apple), referring to the fact that the plant grows low to
  the ground, and the fresh blooms have a pleasing apple scent. Even at
  this level of naming, all is not clear.  Roman chamomile is indeed
  low growing, and is used for clipped lawns in England.  But German
  chamomile grows to a relatively stately 2 1/2 feet.
  
                           - Telling Them Apart -
  
  "German chamomile is a sweet-scented, branching plant whose tiny
  leaves are twice-divided into thin linear segments. The flowers, up
  to one inch across, have a hollow, cone-shaped receptacle, with tiny
  yellow disk flowers covering the cone.  The cone is surrounded by 10
  to 20 white, down-curving ray flowers, giving it the appearance of a
  miniature daisy. German chamomile is native to Europe and Western
  Asia, where it is weedy; it has escaped from cultivation in the
  United States as well."
  
  "Roman chamomile...has a spreading habit and grows only about a foot
  high. Leaves are twice or thrice divided into linear segments, which
  are flatter and thicker than those of German chamomile. Its flowers
  are also up to an inch across, but its disk is a broader conical
  shape, and the receptacle is solid. Roman chamomile also has white
  ray flowers, though a number of cultivated varieties have none at all
  and give the appearance of little yellow buttons.  There are also
  double-flowered cultivars (well-known by the sixteenth century), and
  a flowerless one called 'Treneague,' named for the English estate on
  which it was developed. Roman chamomile is native to Western Europe
  northward to Northern Ireland.
  
  "If you have a pile of dried chamomile flowers, you can distinguish
  the Roman from the German by splitting the flower receptacle open
  down the middle.  If the receptacle is solid, it is Roman; if hollow,
  it is German. You should test five or ten flowers to be sure, because
  occasionally a German chamomile flower will be solid in the interior.
  Roman chamomile has slightly hairy stems, while those of the German
  are smooth. In the live plant, the flowers of Roman chamomile sit
  singly atop the stem, while those of the German are on divided stems
  in a comb-like arrangement (known as a corymb)."

                       - Chamomile for Your Health -
  
  "In Europe, chamomile is highly esteemed as a medicinal herb.
  Matricaria recutita is included in the pharmacopoeias of 26
  countries. Writing on the plant in the Australian journal _Focus on
  Herbs_, Slovakian chamomile expert Ivan Salamon quoted a common folk
  saying of his country: 'An individual should always bow before the
  creative powers of the chamomile plant.'  And 'As a popular remedy,
  it may be thought of as the European counterpart of ginseng,' Dr.
  Varro Tyler wrote in _The New Honest Herbal_. Dr. Tyler tells us that
  the Germans describe it as alles zutraut ~ 'capable of anything.'
  
  "Are these statements just overenthusiasm, or is there meaning behind
  the folklore?  Indeed, German chamomile, and to a lesser extent, Roman
  chamomile, is among the best-researched medicinal herbs now used in
  Europe. There it is used in a wide variety of ways and in dozens of
  products: compresses, rinses, or gargles are used externally for the
  treatment of inflammations and irritations of the skin, mouth, gums,
  and respiratory tract, and for hemorrhoids.  A chamomile bath - a
  pound of flowers to 20 gallons of water - is also used.
  (Alternatively, alcohol extracts of the flowers are available in
  Europe - a much more convenient way to take a chamomile bath!)
  
  "Internally, a tea made from 2 to 3 grams of the herb to a cup of
  water is used to relieve spasms and inflammations of the intestinal
  tract, as well as for peptic ulcers. (Remember that there are about
  28 grams in an ounce, so this is a very mild tea.)  A mild tea is
  also used as a sleeping aid, particularly for children. These
  medicinal uses, cited in a monograph developed by the European
  Scientific Cooperative for Phytomedicine, are backed by intensive
  research of recent years as well as many centuries of common use."
  
  "Over the last decade, the popular press and even medical literature
  in the United States have reported that drinking chamomile tea may
  cause severe allergic reactions. The basis for this, according to Dr.
  Tyler, is 50 allergic reactions resulting from 'chamomiles' reported
  between 1887 and 1982.  Of these, only five were attributed to German
  chamomile. I think this says more about its safety than it does any
  potential harm; nonetheless, persons who experience allergic
  reactions to ragweed or other members of the aster family are warned
  that they should use chamomile with caution.
  
  "German chamomile has highly variable chemistry.  To date, more than
  120 chemical components have been identified from its clear blue
  essential oil. For many years, chamazulene was thought to be the
  primary active component, but scientists now believe that any
  antiinflammatory, antispasmodic, antimicrobial, and mildly sedative
  effect is due to one called bisabolol. Since the late 1970s and
  1980s, European plant breeders, producers, chemists, and
  pharmacologists have been working on programs to improve the plant.
  Today, they recognize four basic chemical types of German chamomile,
  which has led to the production of higher-quality chamomile with more
  stable, predictable constituents and higher levels of active
  components. Crop improvement programs are continuing in both eastern
  and western Europe."

      4 lb Potatoes
    1/2 lb Chopped scallions
     10 fl Milk
      4 oz Butter
           Pepper

  in the center.  It is eaten with a spoon from the outside, each
  spoonful being dipped in the well of melted butter. . Peel potatoes
  and cook in boiling water.  Simmer milk and scallions together for
  five minutes. Strain potatoes and mash thoroughly.  Add hot milk, and
  the scallions, salt and pepper, and half the butter. . The
  traditional implement used for pounding potatoes was a wooden masher,

  woman that lived in a lamp; she had no room to beetle her champ. .
  She's up'd with her beetle and broke the lamp, and now she has room

    3/4 c  Butter or margarine
      1 tb Champagne
  4 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
           Red food color
 
  Grease and lightly flour one 9" round pan and one 13x9x2 pan; set
  aside. In a very large bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking
  powder, soda, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add milk, shortening, 1/2 cup

 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 ea Chicken breast/boned/skinned
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Champagne; dry
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      3 tb Tarragon; fresh (1 t dry)
      1 x  Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 x  ----optional ingredients----
      6 ea Prosciutto slices/paper thin
      3 ea Shallots; finely chopped
      1 tb Butter or margarine
 
  *** See instructions at end if using the optional ingredients. Cut
  chicken into 1/4" wide slices. Melt the butter and olive oil in a
  large heavy skillet. Saute the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the
  chicken and keep warm. Deglaze the pan with the champagne. Add the
  cream to the pan. Add the tarragon and reduce the sauce for two
  minutes. Put the chicken back into the pan and bring just to a
  simmer. Remove to serving platter. Serve hot with fresh vegetables or
  over rice or pasta. (I serve this over fettucini, or with a side dish
  of Fettucini Alfredo). *** Cut chicken breasts in half only. Place
  each half between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a meat
  tenderizer until about 1/8" thick. Saute shallots in butter until
  tender. Divide shallots equally between the breast halves, spreading
  evenly over each. Place one slice of prosciutto on each breast half,
  fold in half, and secure with toothpicks. Saute about 4 to 5 minutes
  on each side in the butter and olive oil listed in the original
  ingredients. Chicken is done when it springs back when lightly
  pressed with finger. Follow the balance of the instructions listed
  above for the sauce. Source: The original recipe came from "The
  Martha Culbertson Cook Booklet" published by Culbertson Winery. The
  "additional ingredients" modification is my own.

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------CENTER MIXTURE----------------------------
      8 oz Cream
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Cognac

MMMMM--------------------------ENROBING-------------------------------
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate
      1 lb Cocoa
 
  It is important to use an excellent quality chocolate when making
  truffles since it is the primary ingredient. Valhrona is my first
  choice and Callebaut is my second. BRING THE CREAM TO A BOIL and pour
  it over the cut chocolate. Allow to stand 1-to-2 minutes and stir
  smooth. Beat in the softened butter and cool to set. Beat with an
  electric mixer (using a paddle attachment if available) on medium
  speed until light. Beat in Cognac. Pipe out small truffles on
  parchment or waxed paper with a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch
  plain tube. Refrigerate to set. Melt the chocolate. Sift the cocoa
  into a deep pan. Dip the truffles in the melted chocolate and then
  deposit them in the cocoa, shaking the pan to cover them. After the

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -I'm pretty sure my parents
           -use stewing beef)
      2    Scallions
      3    Cloves garlic
      1 c  Beef broth
      1 c  Soy sauce
    1/3    - 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
           -dash black pepper
 
  1) Place meat in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to boil,
  skimming froth.  Simmer 2 hours. Remove meat from liquid and reduce
  to 1 cup (or use canned broth and save this broth for something
  else). Cool meat, then slice into pieces approx. 1 1/2 in. x 1 in. 2)
  Coarsely chop scallions and smash and chop garlic. Place meat slices
  into pan with scallions, garlic, beef stock and soy sauce and bring
  to boil. Add cayenne and black pepper. Simmer 5 mins. 3) Remove pan
  from heat and cool. Place contents in a container and refrigerate
  (the fat will rise to the top and harden and can be easily removed).
  This meat will keep indefinitely, but it's pretty tasty, so that's
  not a problem with this small amount. I think this is the kind of
  thing that is good to have on hand in the fridge to snack on (with
  some rice and kimchee, of course) or as part of a simple meal.

           Scallion oil
           Crisp-fried shallots
      1 tb Roasted peanuts, ground
      1 lb Raw shrimp in the shell
      1 tb Salt
      6    Garlic cloves, crushed

      1 tb Granulated sugar
      4    Ounces pork fat
      4 ts Nuoc mam
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Peanut Sauce
           Vegetable Platter
      8    Ounces 6 1/2-inch rice
           -paper rounds (banh trang)
     12    Piece fresh sugar cane, or
     12 oz Sugar cane packed in light
           -syrup, drained
     12    8-1/2 ea inch bamboo skewers
           -soaked in water for 30

           Vegetable oil, for shaping
           -shrimp paste

           -vermicelli
 
  The allied recipes for this rather complex operation follow in the
  next post. Although this dish can be baked in an oven, I strongly
  suggest you grill it over charcoal, for the result is far superior.
  The dish may be prepared over 2 consecutive days.  On day one,
  prepare the dipping sauce and condiments.  The Vegetable Platter and
  shrimp paste can be assembled the following day. Fresh sugar cane may
  be obtained at Caribbean markets; canned sugar cane is available at
  Asian grocery stores. Prepare the roasted rice powder, scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and roasted peanuts. Set aside. Shell and devein
  the shrimp. Sprinkle the salt over the shrimp and let stand for 20
  minutes. Rinse the shrimp thoroughly with cold water. Drain and
  squeeze between your hands to remove excess water. Dry thoroughly
  with paper towels.  Coarsely chop the shrimp. Boil the pork fat for
  10 minutes. Drain and finely dice. In a food processor, combine the
  shrimp, garlic, shallots and sugar. Process until the shrimp paste
  pulls away from the sides of the container, stopping as necessary to
  scrape down the sides. The paste should be very fine and sticky. Add
  the pork fat, roasted rice powder, fish sauce and black pepper to
  taste to the processor. Pulse briefly, only enough to blend all of
  the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate. Meanwhile, prepare the Peanut
  Sauce and Vegetable Platter. Cover the rice papers with a damp towel
  and a sheet of plastic wrap; keep at room temperature until needed.
  Peel the fresh sugar cane; cut crosswise into 4-inch sections. Split
  each section lengthwise into quarters. (if using canned sugar cane,
  split each section lengthwise in half only, then thread 2 pieces
  lengthwise onto a skewer.) Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a small
  bowl. Oil your fingers. Pick up and mold about 2 tablespoons of the
  shrimp paste around and halfway down a piece of fresh sugar cane.
  Leave about 1 1/2 inches of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a
  handle. (If using canned sugar cane, there is no need to leave a
  handle. The skewers will serve as handles.) Press firmly so that the
  paste adheres to the cane. Proceed until you have used all the shrimp
  paste. Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the oven to broil.
  Meanwhile, steam the noodles, then garnish with the scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and ground roasted peanuts. Keep warm.  Pour the
  peanut sauce into individual bowls and place the Vegetable Platter
  and rice papers on the table. Grill the shrimp paste on the sugar
  cane over medium coals, turning frequently. Or Broil, on a baking
  sheet lined with foil, under the broiler, about 6 inches from the
  heat, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer to a
  warm platter. To serve, each diner dips a rice paper round in a bowl
  of warm water to make it pliable, then places the paper on a dinner
  plate. Different ingredients from the Vegetable Platter, some noodles
  and a piece of the shrimp paste, which has been removed from the
  sugar cane, are added. The rice paper is then roiled up to form a
  neat package. The roll is dipped in the Peanut Sauce and eaten out of
  hand. The remaining sugar cane may be chewed. Note: If both types of
  sugar cane are unavailable, use skewers. Shape the shrimp paste into
  meatballs and thread 3 or 4 on each skewer. Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: CHAO TOM (SHRIMP & SUGAR CANE ROLLS)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp, shelled and deveined
      2 ts Salt
      2    Garlic cloves
      2    Shallots
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Toasted rice powder
      1 tb Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc
           -mam)
      2 tb Ice water
           Vegetable oil to oil your
           -hands
           Three 6-inch long canned
           -sugar cane sections
      1    Cucumber, peeled and cut
           -into thin slivers
      1 c  Fresh mint leaves
      1 c  Fresh coriander leaves
           Twelve butter or red leaf
           -lettuce leaves
           Twelve 8-inch round dried
           -rice papers

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
      4    Garlic cloves
      2    Fresh Serrano chiles
      2 tb Sugar
      6 tb Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc
           -man)
      4 tb Fresh lime juice
      6    To 8 tablespoons water
 
  The Vietnamese use a small indoor earthen stove fueled with coal set
  on the table to simmer, boil and barbecue. I have broiled this dish
  in an oven, with excellent results. Sugar cane makes this recipe
  visually exciting and exotic.  Its sweetness subtly melts into the
  shrimp paste. Sugar cane comes fresh and canned in better Asian
  markets; the former is scarce and very expensive.  Check with the
  grocery clerk to make certain that you are buying the 6- to 7-inch
  long stalks, not the cubes. The recipe serves well as a buffet
  appetizer or as a first course for a dinner party.
  
  Shell and devein the shrimp.  Toss with salt; let sit for 10 minutes.
  Rinse with cold water; drain thoroughly. Blot dry. In a food
  processor, finely mince the garlic and shallots.  Add sugar, pepper,
  toasted rice powder, fish sauce, and shrimp; process into a smooth
  paste.
  
  With the machine running, pour the ice water through the feed tube;
  process until the shrimp is light and fluffy. Cover and refrigerate.
  Pour vegetable oil into a small bowl. Place a wire cooling rack on a
  baking sheet; brush with oil.
  
  Cut the sugar cane lengthwise into quarters to make 12 long strips.
  Dip your fingers into the oil, then take about 2 tablespoons shrimp
  paste and evenly mold a 1-inch cylinder around a sugar cane strip,
  leaving 1 inch free at both ends.
  
  Arrange the rolls on the rack diagonally, and keep them from touching
  each other.
  
  Arrange the cucumber, mint and coriander leaves, and lettuce on a
  platter; set aside.
  
  Broil the shrimp rolls about 6 inches from the heat, turning once,
  until the edges are bright orange and the filling feels firm to the
  touch, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
  
  To serve, take a rice paper sheet and set it on a plate. Dip a pastry
  brush into a bowl of water. Brush the entire rice paper generously
  with water.
  
  Let it sit until the paper is pliable and somewhat flimsy. Put a
  lettuce leaf on one end of the paper.
  
  Place a cucumber sliver, mint and coriander leaves on top of the
  lettuce.
  
  Take a hot stick of sugar cane, break off the shrimp and place it on
  top of the vegetables.  Begin rolling up the paper to enclose the
  filling; form it into the shape of a cylinder. Drip into the nuoc
  Cham Dipping Sauce,. and take a bite, then chew on the sugar cane for
  the sweetness (do not swallow the sugar cane).
  
  NUOC CHAM DIPPING SAUCE: Grind the garlic, chiles and sugar into a
  paste in a mortar, blender or mini-food processor. Stir in fish
  sauce, lime and water.  Strain into a dipping bowl.
  
  NOTE:  If sugar cane is not available, use a skewer or inexpensive
  bamboo chopsticks.  Soak them in water overnight before wrapping with
  shrimp paste.
  
  Makes 12 rolls or serves 6.

      Title: CHAPATI (PHULKA)
 Categories: Breads, Indian
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1 c  Whole wheat flour (or 1/3
           White + 2/3 wh.
    1/2 c  Water
 
  1. Put flour in a large bowl with half the water 2. Blend the two
  together until it holds. 3. Beat and knead well until it forms a
  compact ball. 4. Knead dough into it is smooth and elastic. 5. Set
  aside for 30 minutes. 6. Knead and divide dough into 4 to 6 parts 7.
  Roll each ball into a tortilla like flat, about 1/8" thick. 8. heat
  an ungreased skillet. 9. Put phulka on it and let cook for about 1
  minute. 10. Turn and cook the second side for 2/3 minute till small
  bubbles form. 11. Turn again and cook the first side pressed lightly
  with a towel. It should puff. Serve warm (maybe slightly buttered).
  
  Note: As the rolled out chappatis will dry out if they are left stand
  while cooking other,  it is advantageous to roll them out
  individually before cooking them.
  
  At step 9, the top should just start to look dry and small bubbles to
  form.

      Title: CHAPATIS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour, unbleached
    1/2 c  Flour, whole wheat
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Ghi
    1/2 c  ;water
 
  Mix flours, salt, and butter and add just enough water to make a firm
  dough, somewhat like a biscuit dough. Knead for 10-15 minutes - the
  more the dough is kneaded, the lighter the bread will be. Shape the
  dough into a ball, cover with a sheet of plastic and let it rest for
  at least 1 hour. If left to rest overnight in the refrigerator, the
  finished bread will be even lighter. When ready to bake, take a small
  piece of dough about the size of a golf ball, or a bit smaller. On a
  lightly floured board, roll the dough into a thin circle, about 5
  inches in diameter. Repeat with all the dough. Heat a griddle or
  heavy-bottomed iron skillet until it is very hot (you will notice the
  smoke rising from it). Place the rolled out chapati on the griddle
  and let it cook for 2-3 minutes, depending on how thin you have
  rolled it. Using a pair of kitchen tongs, you can lift the chapati to
  see if the underside has turned a golden brown. Flip, and cook the
  other side about 1 minute. As they are cooked, store the chapatis on
  a towel in a warm covered container until ready to serve. Serve as
  soon as the last chapati is baked. NOTE: In India breads sometimes
  are baked in the fiery clay tandoor, where they develop brown spots
  and bubbles. To achieve a similar effect at home, you can use tongs
  to hold each chapati over a hot gas flame until it puffs like a
  little balloon.  The chapati will collapse as it cools.

 Categories: Indian, Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
    2/3 c  Unbleached all purpose flour
    1/2 c  Water approximately
    1/4 ts Salt (optional)
 
  Make up the dough approximately 1/2-hour before you need it. Allow the
  dough to rest about 10 minutes. Pinch off portion of dough to form a
  ball about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Roll ball flat on lightly
  floured surface. Pat back and forth between hands until thin.
  (Patting makes the chapati puff when baked.)
  
  Cook on top of the stove on ungreased griddle until browned and
  puffed. Use medium heat so the griddle does not get too hot.

      Title: CHAPATIS #2
 Categories: Indian, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Whole Wheat Flour
      1 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Water
 
  Yield:  12 Chapatis Cooking Time: 2 Minutes Each
  
  Put the flour and salt into a bowl.  Add the water and mix to a stiff
  dough; knead well until the dough feels firm and elastic. Then place
  in a greased plastic bag or in grease proof paper and leave in a warm
  place for 30 minutes.  Turn onto a floured board, shape the dough
  into a long roll, and divide into 12 equal slices. Roll out paper
  thin. Heat the heavy frying pan and when very hot, cook the chapatis
  for not more than one minute on either side.  Cool in a tea towel.
  Chapatis should always be cooked fresh for each meal.
  
  NOTE:
  
  To cook them, you can use an ungreased heavy frying pan, griddle,
  bakestone or solid plate.
  
  Left-over chapatis make an attractive crispbread when dried off in a
  cool oven.

      3 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      1 tb Japanese soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Soak the Chinese mushrooms in 1 cup hot water for 20 minutes. When
  they have softened, cut off the hard stems and slice the caps fine.
  Drop the spinach into 10 cups of boiling water. Boil rapidly for 2
  minutes. Drain. Run under cold water.  Squeeze out as much moisture
  as possible. Peel the carrot, cut into 3 sections and then into fine
  julienne strips. Wipe off the fresh mushrooms and break off their
  stems. Cut the caps into very fine slices.  Cut the nonwoody part of
  the stems into matchstick pieces. Cut away and discard the curly,
  tender part of the cabbage leaves. Save only the V-shaped core of the
  leaves. Cut this into julienne strips. Cut the scallions into
  2-1/2-inch sections.  Quarter the section with the bulb lengthwise.
  Combine the Chinese mushrooms, spinach, carrot, zucchini, mushrooms,
  cabbage, and scallions in a bowl. Mix well, separating all the
  spinach leaves. Heat the vegetable oil and the sesame oil in a wok or
  a 10-inch saute pan over a medium-high flame.  When hot, put in the
  garlic. Stir and fry for 10 seconds. Add all the vegetables in the
  bowl. Stir and fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until the vegetables are
  tender-crisp. Turn the heat to low. Add the drained noodles, soy
  sauce, and salt. Stir well, distributing the noodles evenly, and cook
  2 to 3 minutes. Taste for seasonings.

  Place eggplant into the bottom of a heavy pot. Sprinkle in the fresh
  peas, dot with ghee & add the remaining ingredients. Bring the liquid
  to a boil & cook for 4 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low, partially
  cover & cook for about 30 minutes, shaking the pot from time to time
  to prevent sticking. If the stock is evaporating too quickly, add
  some more & reduce the heat. When almost all the stock has
  evaporated, add the frozen peas (if you are using them instead of
  fresh) reduce the heat further & fry until a crust has begun to form
  on the bottom of the pot & the eggplant has begun to char.
  
  Remove from the heat & let sit for 3 to 4 minutes. Gently stir in the
  crust & serve immediately.

      Title: CHAR SHU (ROAST PORK)
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
      6 tb Sugar
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Dark soy sauce
    1/4 c  Rice wine
      1 cl Garlic
      3 sl Ginger root
      3 lb Pork -- butt, shoulder,
           Tenderloin
 
  PREPARATION:
  
  Heat water and add sugar and salt, stirring until melted. Remove from
  stove.  Add soy sauce and rice wine. Smash, peel, and mince garlic,
  and add to the soy sauce mixture. Peel and mince ginger root and add.
  Mix well. Place meat in a bowl and pour the mixture over it. If meat
  is not completely covered, you will need to turn it frequently as it
  marinates. Allow it to stand in the refrigerator for 48 hours. (You
  can cheat and make the marinating time shorter -- never shorter than
  6 hours -- but the longer the time, the more the meat will tenderize
  and absorb the fine flavor.) Pour off marinade, but do not wipe meat.
  Place the meat on a rack in a baking pan.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Heat oven to 450-degrees.  Bake the meat for 10 minutes. Reduce heat
  to 250-degrees and bake for 30 minutes. Turn meat over and bake for
  another 30 minutes.

  board and roll it into a long sausage. Cut sausage into 1-inch
  lengths, flatten these pieces, and roll each out to the size of a
  saucer to form wrapping. Put 1 tablespoon of filling in center of
  each wrapping, flute edges of wrapping, bring egdes together to form
  a sack, and seal by giving a slight twist and pinching with thumb and
  forefinger. Place buns in steamer rack on a wet cloth and steam for
  15 to 20 minutes. Note: Leftover buns may be served after reheating,
  either by steaming or frying. The filling (A) may also be fried to

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/3 lb Mushrooms; commercial, wild,
           -or a mixture of both
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Onion; finely diced
      1    Clove Garlic; minced
      1 pn Dried Savory; crumbled
      1 pn Pepper
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Dry Sherry or Madeira
     12 oz Salmon Fillets; cross-cut
      4 lg Swiss Chard Leaves; stemmed,
           -blanched, rinsed in cold
           -water, drained and patted
           -dry
    1/2 c  Brown Veal or Poultry Stock
      1 oz Dry White Wine
 
  Finely dice the mushrooms (if using wild mushrooms with an interesting
  shape, cut them into long strips or wedges.) Melt 1 tb of the butter
  in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms
  and onion and cook, shaking or stirring, until the mushrooms begin to
  wilt. Add the garlic, savory, pepper, and 1/8 ts salt. Cook until the
  liquid given off by the mushrooms is nearly gone, then add the sherry
  and cook until evaporated. Remove from heat, taste for seasoning, and
  set aside to cool.
  
  Remove any pin bones from the salmon fillets and season lightly with
  remaining salt and pepper. Lay out 2 chard leaves in opposite
  directions, slightly overlapping. Place a salmon fillet across the
  middle, skin side up (if the belly flap is especially long or thin,
  fold it double for a more compact, even shape.) Arrange 1/4 of the
  mushrooms mixture on each side of the salmon. Fold the near end of
  the leaves over the fish, tuck in the sides, then fold the whole
  thing over the remaining leaf, forming an envelope. Trim off the
  remainder of the leaf to form a neat package. Repeat with the
  remaining salmon fillet.
  
  Heat the stock and wine to a simmer in the same skillet used for the
  mushrooms. Place the salmon packages in the pan, seam side down,
  cover, and cook at a simmer until a skewer easily enters the center
  of the fish, 8-12 minutes depending on the thickness.
  
  Transfer the fish to plates, turn the heat under the skillet to high,
  and reduce the stock slightly. Swirl in the remaining butter, taste
  for seasoning, and pour over the fish.

  Charlene Prickett combines brain with brawn on IT FIGURES, her
  long-running exercise show for Lifetime Television. "I have a real
  academic streak," says Prickett. "I have a lot of interest in science
  and in keeping up with the research that's always changing. Every
  year I go to fitness conferences and sports-medicine clinics
  throughout the country, and I always like to share what I've learned
  by including an information element in my shows." So what does the
  latest research say about the most effective way to get a good
  workout? Says Prickett, "In terms of being optimally effective,
  cross-training - weight training, along with some stretching and
  aerobic activity - has come to be thought of as important. The
  advantage is that you don't stress the body in the same way every
  single day, and it prevents injury as well as boredom."
  
  Prickett also believes that women have to work harder than men at
  battling the bulge. "When you're young or if you're a man, the
  likelihood of your staying near ideal weight with exercise alone is
  good. However, if you're female or over 25, it generally takes both
  regular exercise AND good food choices. That doesn't mean you can
  never have an ice-cream sundae, but to stay at or near ideal weight,
  you need to make discriminating food choices."
  
  For dressing: mix all ingredients and chill.
  
  For salad: mix all ingredients except lettuce in a bowl, add
  dressing, and chill for 1 hour. Arrange lettuce leaves in a salad
  bowl, add salad.

 Categories: Cookies, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      1 ts Double-acting baking powder
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 lb (2 sticks) butter
      1 c  Dark brown sugar, firmly
           -packed
      2    Eggs (leave 1 egg whole and
           -separate the other) 1 tsp.
           -water 10 ounces
 
  (2-1/4 cups) salted peanuts (dry roasted), chopped medium fine Scant
  3/4 cup smooth (not chunky) peanut butter 4 ounces (2/3 cup) semisweet
  chocolate morsels
  
  Sift together the flour, baking powder, and cinnamon and set aside.
  In the large bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter. Add the
  sugar and beat to mix. Beat in 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk. On low
  speed gradually add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl
  with a rubber spatula and beating only until thoroughly mixed.
  
  Place a long piece os wax paper on the work surface. Divide the dough
  into 36 equal mounds on the wax paper. Use a heaping teaspoonful for
  each mound. Flour your hands and roll each mound into a round ball.
  Place on waxed paper.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375.  Cut aluminum foil to fit cookie sheets.
  
  In a small, shallow bowl, beat the reserved egg white with the water,
  beating until foamy.
  
  Place the chopped peanuts on a long piece of aluminum foil or wax
  paper. Pick up a cookie and use your fingers to roll it around in the
  egg white and then place it on the chopped nuts. Roll it around and
  coat thoroughly. Coat 4 or 5 cookies at a time.  Place the cookies 2
  inches apart on the cut aluminum foil.
  
  Form a depression in the top of each cookie, either with the handle
  of a large wooden spoon or your thumb. Make the depression rather
  deep and wide but not so deep that you make the bottom of the cookie
  too thin.
  
  Place a generous 1/2 tsp. of the peanut butter in each indentation.
  Place about 5 or 6 chocolate morsels on the top of each cookie,
  pressing them slightly.
  
  Bake for 12 to 13 minutes.  Let cool 1 to 2 minutes on sheet. When at
  room temperature refrigerate briefly to set the chocolate.

 Categories: Mexican, Salsa
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        1 cn whole tomatoes
      1/4 sm onion
        2    Cloves garlic
        3    canned jalapenos
        1 ts honey
  
  This is a recipe for salsa that is very different. I got it from a
  longtime artist friend of mine who lives in taos, New Mexico. I don't
  usually measure ingredients when I make it so use your own judgement.
  
  Take 1 can whole tomatoes and extract the juice into a food
  processor. I open the can, pour out the juice and then squeeze the
  tomatoes with my fingers to extract more. Add onion, garlic,
  jalapenos (or more to taste), and honey to the food processor or
  blender. Process until smooth. Add the tomatoes and just hit the
  button on the food processor a couple of times to chop the tomatoes.
  DO NOT process them.  The salsa has a slightly sweet flavor due to
  the honey combined with the hotness of the jalapenos gives it a
  unique taste.

 Categories: Candies, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     16    Ladyfinger cookies -- halved
           Lengthwise
      4 lg Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Milk
      1    2 " piece
      2 ts Gelatin -- softened in
    1/4 c  Cold water
    1/2 c  Sour cream -- chilled
    1/2 c  Heavy cream -- chilled
      1    Raspberry puree
           Vanilla bean
 
  Trim 12 of the ladyfinger halves, tapering them slightly at one end.
  Arrange these halves, side by side, curved sides down, on the bottom
  of a 1 quart charlotte mold with the tapered ends meeting in the
  center. Stand the remaining ladyfingers, curved side out, side by
  side around the inside of the mold; if possible, avoid leaving any
  open spaces between them.
  
  Beat the egg yolks briefly in a mixing bowl with a whisk or an
  electric or rotary mixer.  Stir beating, gradually add the sugar, and
  continue to beat until the mixture is thick and pale yellow and runs
  sluggishly off the beater when lifted from the bowl. In a small
  saucepan, warm the milk and vanilla bean over moderate heat until
  bubbles appear around the edge of the pan.. Remove the bean and
  slowly pour the hot milk into the eggs, beating constantly.  Cook
  over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens into a
  custard heavy enough to coat a spoon. Do not let it boil or it will
  curdle.
  
  Off the heat, stir in the softened gelatin.  When it has completely
  dissolved, strain the custard through a fine sieve set over a large
  bowl. With a whisk or rotary or electric beater, whip together the
  sour cream and heavy cream until the mixture forms stiff peaks on the
  beater when it is lifted out of the bowl. Fill half a large pot with
  ice cubes and cover them with 2 inches of water, set the bowl of
  custard into the pot and stir the custard with a metal spoon for at
  least 5 minutes, or until it is quite cold and just beginning to
  thicken to a syrupy consistency. With a rubber spatula,  gently fold
  the whipped cream into the custard. Pour the mixture into the
  prepared mold, smooth the top with a spatula, cover with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate for 4 or 5 hours.
  
  To unmold the charlotte russe, invert a flat serving plate on top of
  the mold and serve the dessert with a bowl of the raspberry puree.

      Title: CHAROSET
 Categories: Condiments, Jewish
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
  1 1/2 c  Nuts, finely chopped
           -(e.g., almonds, walnuts,
           -filberts)
      2 tb Sugar or honey (or a
           -mixture)
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      2 c  Apples (or less),
           -chopped or grated
           -(about 4-6 medium
           -apples)
           Sweet wine
 
  Mix nuts, sugar, honey, apples and cinnamon together until
  well-blended. Add wine slowly until the texture resembles a thick
  paste, like mortar. Taste and adjust cinnamon, sugar, wine amounts.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional Seder accompaniment -- This paste-like, sweet spread
  is a prescribed part of the traditional Seder. Its mortar-like
  consistency is intended to remind Jews of the bricks and mortar our
  ancestors labored with as slaves in Egypt. Quite incidentally, it is
  delicious and tastes wonderful spread on matzah. This is the
  traditional charoset from the Ashkenazic (Eastern European) Jewish
  tradition; very different, but equally delicious, charoset recipes,
  using such ingredients as dates, raisins and sesame, can be found in
  the various Sephardic communities (e.g., Yemenite, Persian, Turkish,
  Moroccan, etc.).
  
  *  This recipe yields about enough for the Seder table. If you like

      Title: CHAROSET (APPLE RELISH WITH CHOPPED NUTS)
 Categories: Relishes, Ethnic
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
  1 1/2 c  Nuts, finely chopped
           -(e.g., almonds, walnuts,
           -filberts)
      2 tb Sugar or honey (or a
           -mixture)
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      2 c  Apples (or less),
           -chopped or grated
           -(about 4-6 medium
           -apples)
           Sweet wine
 
  Mix nuts, sugar, honey, apples and cinnamon together until
  well-blended. Add wine slowly until the texture resembles a thick
  paste, like mortar. Taste and adjust cinnamon, sugar, wine amounts.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional Seder accompaniment -- This paste-like, sweet spread
  is a prescribed part of the traditional Seder. Its mortar-like
  consistency is intended to remind Jews of the bricks and mortar our
  ancestors labored with as slaves in Egypt. Quite incidentally, it is
  delicious and tastes wonderful spread on matzah. This is the
  traditional charoset from the Ashkenazic (Eastern European) Jewish
  tradition; very different, but equally delicious, charoset recipes,
  using such ingredients as dates, raisins and sesame, can be found in
  the various Sephardic communities (e.g., Yemenite, Persian, Turkish,
  Moroccan, etc.).
  
  *  This recipe yields about enough for the Seder table. If you like
  this as much as we do, you will want to make more.
  
  *  Some people prefer a chunkier, less smoothly-blended charoset.
  
  *  If you live in an area where Kosher for Passover ground nuts (not
  groundnuts) are available, they save a lot of chopping time and lead
  to a smoother consistency. If you're lucky enough to have a Kosher
  for Passover food processor, you will also save a lot of arm
  exercise. And remember, kids love to chop!

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        2    whole tomatoes
        2    jalapeno peppers
        2 TB olive oil
        2 TB red onion -- diced

  :          freshly ground black pepper
  
  As soon as the snapper comes off the grill, sprinkle it with the
  vinaigrette (which has to be at room temperature). The vinaigrette
  heats up on the fish and all the flavors spring to life.
  
  Brush the jalapenos and tomatoes with olive oil, and cook on the grill
  until the skin is charred. Let the peppers and tomatoes cool and then
  coarsely chop the tomatoes and slice the jalapenos thin.
  
  In a large mixing bowl combine the remaining ingredients, including
  the salt and pepper to taste, with the jalapenos and tomatoes, and
  whisk until blended. Bring to room temperature before serving.
  
  Spoon the vinaigrette, to taste, over the fish as soon as you take it
  off the grill and serve immediately.

      Title: CHARRED TOMATO SOUP WITH CORN & PEPPER RELI
 Categories: Soup, Tomatoes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Wood chips for smoking --
           Mesquite
      2    Ears corn
      1    Red bell pepper
  2 1/2 lb Roma tomatoes
      2 tb Olive oil
      3 tb Green onion -- thinly
           Sliced
      2 c  Chicken broth
      1 tb Lime juice
  1 1/2 ts Fresh sage -- minced
      4    Sprigs sage -- optional
      4 pn Salt -- to taste
 
  #1.  If using mesquite chips, soak them in water to cover for at
  least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour. Remove husks and silks from about 1
  3/4 pounds of corn on the cob. Stem, seed and halve lengthwise a red
  or orange bell pepper. Select ripe romas or Italian plum tomatoes;
  cut each in half lengthwise. #2. Drain chips well. In a barbecue with
  a lid, scatter half the chips over a solid bed of very hot coals (you
  can hold your hand at grill level only 1 second). For gas grills,
  turn on high, let heat 10 minutes, then put half the chips in a foil
  pan and set directly on flame in a corner of the grill. #3. Place
  corn and pepper halves on a well-oiled grill 4 to 6 inches above
  coals. Close lid, open vents, and cook until vegetables are lightly
  charred, 8 to l0 minutes; turn occasionally during cooking. Remove
  from grill and set aside. #4. Scatter remaining chips over the coals
  (or place in the foil pan). Brush cut sides of tomatoes with olive
  oil. Place tomatoes cut sides down on the grill. Close lid and cook
  until tomatoes are slightly charred, about 7 minutes. With a spatula,
  carefully remove tomatoes from grill. Reserve 4 nice-looking tomato
  halves. #5. Place remaining tomatoes in a blender with the chicken
  broth. Whirl until smooth; blend in batches if necessary. Transfer
  tomato mixture to a 4- to 5-quart soup pan. Stir often over medium
  heat until steaming, 8 to 10 minutes. #6. While soup heats, cut corn
  from cobs and coarsely chop pepper. Mix together corn kernels,
  pepper, green onion, lime juice, and sage leaves. #7. Divide tomato
  soup equally among 4 bowls. Spoon equal amounts of corn relish into
  the center of the soup. Lay 1 reserved tomato half, cut side up, next
  to each pile of corn and garnish with a sage sprig. Add salt to taste.

      Title: CHAT MASALA
 Categories: Sauces, Indian
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 tb Cumin seeds
  1 1/2 ts Fennel seeds
      1 tb Garam masala
      1 tb Mango powder
      1 tb Black salt
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 pn Asafetida powder
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
 
  Asafetida, mango powder, and black salt distinguish the chat masala
  from other masalas, giving the blend a sourness that makes it a
  welcome accompaniment to fresh fruit and other snacks. ('Chat' refers
  to various snacks and to the North Indian cafes that serve them.)
  Fresh fruit often is sprinkled with lime juice and chat masala. Black
  salt (which is actually reddish gray), available at Indian food
  stores, has a distinctive flavor that's quite different from sea salt
  or table salt. The garam masala is the wild card in this recipe;
  either one of the (Tamil Nadu Curry Powder or Punjabi-Style Garam
  Masala) masalas may be used.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Toast and grind cumin and fennel seeds and
  combine with remaining ingredients.

  This creole pork sausage is a local favorite dating well back into the
  nineteenth century.  Its firm texture and hearty, spicy flavor make
  it an excellent accompaniment to red or white beans and rice or
  grilled as a breakfast sausage. ~
  
  Prepare sausage casings by soaking them in cold water for an hour,
  then running cold water through them. Cut off a 3 yard length. Repack
  the rest and refrigerate for later use.
  
  Cut the pork and fat into small pieces with a sharp knife. Mix
  together and run once through the coarse blade of the meat grinder,
  placing a large bowl in front of the grinder to catch the meat. Add
  seasonings and mix vigorously with a wooden spoon or large stiff wire
  whisk until stuffing is fluffy and very smooth.
  
  Cut casing into 16 inch lengths and stuff.
  
  To cook, place in a large heavy skillet or saute pan with about 1/4
  inch cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover the pan, then
  reduce heat to low and cook for about 15 minutes. Uncover, raise heat
  to medium and cook until sausage is well browned on all sides, about
  10 minutes longer, turning frequently with tongs. Drain on paper
  towels. Allow one chaurice per person. [-=PAM=-]

      1 tb Ground red chili pepper
    1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
 
  Roast chili peppers according to your favorite method. (I don't have
  a gas stove or other type of open flame, so I heat the oven to the
  hottest temperature, then bake the peppers on a heavy-duty baking
  sheet, turning if necessary to char all sides.  The roasted peppers
  are placed in a bowl, covered, then allowed to steam a few minutes to
  help facilitate removal of the peels.) Carefully remove peels from
  roasted peppers, leaving stems attached. Remove seeds by cutting a
  slit along one side of each pepper and gently scraping and rinsing
  out seeds and attached membranes. Pat dry and set aside. FILLING: In
  a heavy skillet, heat oil on medium-high. Add garlic, onion and
  chayote; cook until onion is translucent and mixture begins to brown,
  stirring frequently. Remove pan from heat and add corn, chili pepper,
  salt, black pepper, and lemon juice, stirring to combine well.
  Gently mix in breadcrumbs and nutritional yeast. On a flat surface,
  open up one pepper at a time and spread about 3 tablespoons of the
  filling mixture down the center of each. Carefully roll sides of
  pepper around filling to enclose, pressing firmly to shape. (Chilies
  may be prepared ahead of time to this point, covered, and
  refrigerated up to 24 hours.) BATTER: In a pie plate or shallow dish,
  stir together cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. Gradually mix
  in water to form a batter of medium consistency. Heat 1-1/2 inches of
  oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Lightly roll each stuffed
  chili pepper in flour. Carefully coat each pepper with batter, as
  evenly as possible, using stem to help drag chili through mixture,
  and a spoon to spread batter over top of chili if necessary. Fry
  chilies in hot oil, two at a time, until lightly browned, turning
  once. It should take about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove and drain
  on absorbent paper. (The temperature and freshness of the oil is
  important. If conditions are right, each chili will absorb LESS than
  1 tablespoon of oil.) (If chilies must be prepared in advance, reheat
  just before serving by placing them on a baking sheet in a preheated
  350 F. oven until hot and crisp.) RED SAUCE: In a food processor or
  blender, puree garlic and onion with tomato sauce. Transfer to a
  saucepan and add water, ground red chili pepper, salt, cinnamon and
  cumin. Cook sauce over medium heat for 30 minutes, stirring
  frequently to prevent scorching. TO SERVE: Spoon a little sauce onto
  each plate, spreading it around in a spiral fashion with the back of
  the spoon to form a large circle. Place a chili onto circle of sauce,
  drizzling a bit of additional sauce over top if desired, and garnish
  with a few slices of avocado and/or some finely minced cilantro
  leaves. A black bean salad and slices of cooling fresh melon and/or
  tropical fruits would be nice accompaniments.

      Title: CHAYOTE RELLENO
 Categories: Desserts, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 sm Chayotes (about 6 ounces
           -each)
    1/2 c  Almonds
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
      1 tb Brandy
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Milk or cream
      1 pn Nutmeg
  1 1/2 c  Sponge cake or pound cake,
           -crumbled into fine crumbs,
           Plus 2 tablespoons for
           -topping (see note)
    1/2 c  Golden sultana or black
           -raisins
      3 tb Slivered almonds
      1 c  Softly whipped cream, barely
           -sweetened
 
  This is a use for chayote that I would never have thought of, but it
  sounds really good.
  
  I love to shock people with the unexpected, such as serving these
  stuffed chayote shells for dessert. In this recipe, chayote's
  delicate texture and taste combine with almonds, sugar, brandy, eggs,
  cream, raisins and sponge cake to make an elegant pudding-like
  filling for the pale-green shells. They are abso- lutely delicious
  and something you might have been served in one of the fine old
  households of colonial Mexico.
  
  Cut the chayote in half lengthwise and steam for 35 minutes, or until
  just tender. Do not overcook--you don't want the shells to collapse
  when you scoop them out.
  
  Meanwhile, combine the almonds and sugar in a food processor and grind
  until the almonds are fairly fine.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
  
  When the chayote is cooked and cool enough to handle, remove the
  seed, and scoop out the pulp, leaving a 1/2-inch-thick shell. Set
  aside.
  
  Place the chayote pulp in the processor with the ground almonds; add
  eggs and process to a puree. Add the brandy, vanilla and milk or
  cream. Blend. Pour mixture into a bowl and stir in nutmeg, cake
  crumbs and raisins.
  
  Spoon the pudding mixture into the chayote shells (you will have
  about 1 1/2 cups left over) and place them in a greased baking dish.
  Sprinkle slivered almonds and reserved cake crumbs over the tops.
  Bake stuffed shells for 30 minutes. Pour remaining pudding mixture
  into a greased loaf pan and bake for 25 minutes.
  
  Serve warm, topped with whipped cream.
  
  Serves 6 lucky people. (The pudding loaf serves 4.)
  
  Note: I cheat and buy a frozen pound cake to use for this recipe.

      Title: CHAYOTE-BLACK-EYED PEA RELISH
 Categories: Barbeque, Beans, Condiments, Pickles and, Salsas
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 sm Chayote fruit
      1 c  Black eyed peas -- cooked
      1 sm Clove garlic -- minced
      1    Serrano chile (deribbed) --
           Seeded and minced
      2 ts Fresh cilantro -- chopped
      4 tb Mango or papaya -- diced
      2    Scallions (white part only)
           Thinly sliced
    1/4 c  Fresh corn kernels --
           Roasted
      2 ts Lime juice -- freshly
           Squeezed
      2 ts White wine -- fine quality
      2 tb Vinaigrette dressing
           Salt -- to taste
 
  Peel the chayote, cut in half, and remove the seed with a knife. Cut
  into 1/4-inch dice and place in a mixing bowl. Combine with the
  remaining ingredients.
   Let sit for at least 1 hour.  Before serving, check the seasonings
  and adjust if necessary.  Makes about 2 cups of relish.
  
  Chef's Notes:  Stephan Pyles, the owner and chef of Dallas' hottest
  new restaurant, Star Canyon, tells us: "Chayote, a green squash about
  the same shape and size as a large pear, was a staple of the Aztecs
  and Mayans, and it is still used extensively in Mexican and South
  American cooking. In Louisiana and Florida, the chayote is known as
  'mirliton.' It is more widely available during winter months and has
  a crisp, crunchy texture and an earthy flavor that suits salsas and
  relishes very well." Entered into MasterCook by Terri Law, 8/22/96.

      1 c  Sifted flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Grated lemon rind
      4 oz (1 stick) butter, softened
      1    Egg yolk

  on the +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++ ++++ Pour the warm water into a warm bowl and add the
  yeast. Stir to dissolve then let stand until light and puffed, about
  5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour, sugar and salt.  Beat with an
  electric mixer on the lowest speed for 1 minute.  Beat on medium
  speed for 2 minutes longer. Add the butter to the yeast mixture and
  beat for another 1 minute. On the lowest speed on the mixer, beat in
  1 egg and 1/2 cup of flour until well blended, repeating until the 4
  eggs are used up and enough flour has been added to make a soft
  sticky dough.  Continue to beat with the mixer or by hand, until the
  dough is glossy and elastic and pulls away from the side of the bowl.
  Stir in the cheddar cheese by hand.  Cover and let rise in a warm
  place free from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
  When the dough has doubled in bulk, punch down and place in the
  refrigerator for at least 5 hours or better, overnight. Remove the
  dough from the refrigerator.
   Divide in half and cover and refrigerate the second ball of dough.
  Knead the remaining ball of dough on a lightly floured surface until
  soft and pliable. Divide the dough into 3 equal parts and roll each
  piece into a rope 12 to 16-inches long.  Braid the ropes, starting in
  the middle and working toward each end. Pinch the ends together so
  seal them. Grease a large baking sheet and place the finished braid
  on one side of the sheet. Repeat with the refrigerated dough. In a
  small bowl beat the egg and milk together.  Brush the braids with the
  egg mixture and let the braids rise in a warm place, free from
  drafts, until dough in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Do not cover.
  Midway through the rising time, brush with the egg mixture again.
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. When fully risen, brush with the
  egg mixture for a final time and sprinkle evenly with the celery
  seeds. Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until a wooden
  skewer or pick inserted in the braid comes out dry. Remove from the
  oven and from the baking sheet. Cool to room temperature, on wire
  racks, before slicing.

      Title: CHEDDAR FANS
 Categories: Breads, Cheese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5 oz Cheddar; sharp, grated
      2 c  Unbleached flour; sifted
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Butter or shortening
    1/2 c  Milk
      1 x  Butter; softened
      1 x  Butter; melted
 
  Grease the bottoms of 12 muffin pan cups.  Grate the cheese into a
  bowl, if not already grated and set aside. Sift the flour, baking
  powder and salt into a bowl. Cut in the shortening with a pastry
  blender or two knives, until the mixture resembles coarse corn meal.
  Make a well in the center of the mixture and add the milk all at once.
   Stir with a fork until the dough forms a ball. Gently form the dough
  into a ball and put on a lightly floured surface. Knead it lightly
  with the fingertips 10 or 15 times. Roll the dough into a 12 X
  10-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick.  Cut into 5 strips and spread
  with the softened butter.  Sprinkle four strips with the grated
  cheddar cheese and stack the four on top of one another and top with
  the fifth strip. Cut into 12 equal pieces and place on end in the
  muffin cups. Brush the tops of the rolls with the melted butter. Bake
  at 450 degrees F. for 10 to 15 minutes or until the biscuits are
  golden brown.  Serve hot with butter. Makes 1 dozen Cheddar Fans.
