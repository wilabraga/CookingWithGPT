 Categories: Casseroles, Chicken, Make-ahead, Quick & eas
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Uncooked rice
     15 oz Canned tomatoes; undrained,
           -chopped
    250 g  Velveeta; diced
    1/4 c  Onion; finely chopped
  1 1/2 ts Italian seasoning; divided
  1 1/4 kg Chicken pieces; skinless
    2/3 c  Parmesan cheese
 
  Stir together water, rice, tomatoes, Velveeta, onion, and 1 tsp of
  Italian seasoning.  Pour into a greased 9"x13" baking dish.  Top with
  chicken, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and remaining seasoning.
  Bakeat 375F for 45-50 mins or until chicken is tender.  Let stand for
  5 mins and serve.
  
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  My notes: Convenient and tasty! I used chicken pieces from a whole
  chicken. I made it up the night before and left it in the fridge
  until I got home from work. For next time: Add more rice, more
  tomatoes (just to make it go further), and it would still be good
  with less Velveeta (to make it less expensive).

      Title: ITALIAN COUNTRY BREAD WITH BIGA
 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
           Biga:
      1 ts Yeast
  1 1/8 c  Warm water
      2 c  Bread flour
           Dough:
           Biga (above )
  1 1/4 c  Bread flour
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Water
 
  Biga is a starter, almost similar to sourdough but not quite.The
  bread has a flavorful, yeasty beery quality. So 10 to 12 hours before
  you want the bread, mix the 1 tsp. yeast in the water and let it
  bubble and foam. Mix in the flour gradually to make a soft almost
  soupy dough. Cover and it will rise and triple in volume and then
  fall back and re-rise during the 6 to 8 hours you let it be. Then
  make the bread. Stir the salt right into the biga mixture, mix in the
  additional water ( cold or cool not warm ) until it is a thin soupy
  quality. Mix in the flour to make a firm but soft dough which leaves
  the sides of the bowl. Turn out to a floured surface and knead dough,
  adding additional flour if necessary to make a smooth dry dough.
  Place dough in a bowl, greased with olive oil, cover and let rise
  doubled about 2 hours. Punch dough down and knead it into a flat
  oval. cut in half and form each half into a baguette and let them
  rest covered with a towel for 30 minutes. then stretch them into
  longer baguette shapes and place them in a baguette baking tray if
  you have it. Let rest for 20 minutes. then slash tops and place into
  a preheated 450 oven for 20 minutes or done. If you don't have a
  baguette tray any baking sheet or baking stone will do. You also
  could shape the breads in one large round loaf instead of 2
  baguettes. Bake the one large loaf 10 to 15 minutes longer. Note:
  since this bread is fat free eat the same day or freeze as it stales
  quickly.

      Title: ITALIAN EASTER BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 pk Dry yeast
  2 1/2    To 3-1/2 cups unbleached
           -flour
    2/3 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter
      2    Eggs, at room temperature
    1/2 c  Mixed candied fruit
    1/3 c  Chopped blanched almonds.
    1/2 ts Anise seed
      2 tb Melted shortening
      5    Uncooked eggs colored with
           -Easter Egg Dye
           ICING:
      1 c  Confectioner's sugar
      1 tb Milk
    1/8 ts Vanilla
 
  colored sprinkles
  
  In a large mixing bowl, blend the sugar, salt, and yeast well with 1
  cup of the flour.  In a saucepan, combine milk and butter, heating
  slowly until liquid is warm and butter is melted. Pour the milk into
  the dry ingredients and beat 125 strokes with a wooden spoon. Add
  eggs and 1/2 cup flour or enough to make a thick batter. beat
  vigorously for 2 minutes.
  
  Then stir in enough flour to make a ball of dough that draws away
  from the sides of the bowl.  Turn out onto a floured board and knead
  for about 10 minutes, working in additional flour to overcome
  stickiness. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease the
  top. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and put in a warm, draft-free
  place until doubled in bulk about 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine the
  fruit,nuts, and anise seed. Punch down the dough and return it to a
  lightly floured board. Knead in the fruit mixture, keeping the syrupy
  pieces dusted with flour until they are worked into the dough.
  Divide the dough in half. Carefully roll each piece into a 24 inch
  rope - the fruit and nuts will make this slightly difficult. Loosely
  twist the two ropes together and form a ring on a greased baking
  sheet.  Pinch the ends together well. Brush the dough with melted
  shortening.  Push aside the twist to make a place for each egg.
  
  Push eggs down carefully as far as possible.  Cover the bread with wax
  paper and let rise in a warm,draft-free place until double in bulk,
  about 1 hour.  Bake the bread in a preheated 350 F oven for about 35
  minutes or until a toothpick inserted in a twist comes out clean.
  Place on a wire rack to cool. Once the bread is cool, drizzle the
  icing on top between the eggs, and decorate with colored sprinkles.
  Makes 1 loaf.

  [We made these, and they turned out just fine. They're really an
  appetizer or part of a varied buffet ~ don't try to use them as the
  entire meal! They're too strongly flavored for that, and you'll be
  sick of them by the time you've had 6 or 10.  Definitely save this
  for when you're entertaining, not just deciding what's for dinner

  Saute the leeks, onions, celery, garlic and mushrooms until the
  onions are clear. Add the stock, nectar or water, tomato sauce and
  white wine. Bring to a heavy simmer and taste. Add the cayenne pepper
  and salt to taste.
  
  Prepare the seafood and add to the pot, remembering to add first those
  things which take longest to cook. The various shellfish go in with
  the shells on.
  
  Simmer until done. Serve in large bowls over spaghetti. By adding
  extra fish such as a lobster per person this will become a meal

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    Lemons, juiced thoroughly
      1 c  Sugar
      1 tb Lemon rind, grated--opt.
           Ice cubes
 
  NOTE:  I use a high powered blender called a VITA MIX to make this
  recipe. Take your chances if you use a regular blender, as chopping
  the ice may be too much for it to handle. If you do use a regular
  blender be sure to add the ice cubes one at a time. Put your lemon
  juice and sugar in the blender container.  Blend until sugar is
  dissolved. Do not wait until after the ice is put in to dissolve the
  sugar as it will not dissolve completely. While blender is running
  add ice cubes until the mixture turns to a slush and it cannot be
  blended anymore. It may take several times of stopping and allowing
  the mixture to settle or stirring it and then blending again. Just be
  sure the mixture is thick and slushy. You may want to adjust the
  taste with more sugar or lemon to your liking, but I found this to be
  just right for our family.  Put mixture into individual freezer
  containers and place in the freezer for at least four hours.  Voila!
  Authentic Italian Ice! Do not substitute lemon concentrate as it does
  not give the same taste result. Hope you like it.  This is one of my
  originals.

           (18 noodles)
     12 oz Mozzarella cheese --
           Shredded
    3/4 c  Parmesan cheese
 
  Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
  Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
  servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
  served without freezing.
  
  Crumble beef; cook until lightly browned.  Stir in onion. Cook until
  onion is tender.  Drain off fat. Stir in seasonings, tomato paste,
  tomato sauce, and water. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  In another bowl, blend eggs with ricotta cheese.
  
  In each pan, spread a layer of meat mixture (about 3/4 cup). Add a
  layer each of noodles (2 1/4), meat mixture (about 3/4 cup), ricotta
  cheese mixture (about 3/4 cup), mozzarella cheese (1/3 cup), and
  parmesan cheese (1 1/2 tablespoons).  Repeat layers until all
  ingredients are used. Pack food tightly to avoid air pockets.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Bake 30
  minutes or until sauce bubbles at edges.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
  wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
  together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
  food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
  tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
  food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
  for 10-12 hours before removing packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN LASAGNA:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Remove
  freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until
  sauce bubbles at edges and center is hot.

      4    Sheets phyllo pastry
  1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter or margarine
           -melted

MMMMM-----------------------APRICOT SPREAD----------------------------
      3 oz Dried apricots; roughly
           -chopped
    1/2 c  Unsweetened apple juice
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 325F.  Generously coat a 9" pie plate with
  vegetable cooking spray.
  
  2.  In a food processor or blender process the cheeses, sugar, egg
  yolks, milk, flour, lemon juice, lemon rind, and vanilla until
  smooth. In a bowl whip the egg whites until stiff and gently fold
  into the mixture.
  
  3.  Place the 4 sheets of phyllo pastry into the prepared pan,
  crisscrossing them on the bottom and brushing each lightly with some
  of the butter or margarine. Trim the overhanging pastry leaving a 2"
  border all around.
  
  (There's an illustration that I can't really reproduce here that
  shows how to place the phyllo leaves. Basically, the bottom 2 are
  crossed and then one is placed horizontal and the other vertical.)
  
  4.  Place the filling in the pan, roll the outer edges of the
  overlapping pastry toward the filling, tucking it in and rolling it
  to create a rim. Brush the edges lightly with the remaining butter or
  margarine.
  
  5.  Place the pan on a cookie sheet, put in the center of the oven.
  Place a baking pan with 2" of water on the lower rack of the oven.
  Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until set. Remove from the oven and
  allow to cool on a rack. Chill for 6 hours or overnight.
  
  6.  Top with the apricot spread, if desired, and serve the pie
  chilled, cut into wedges.
  
  *This pie can be baked without the crust as a pudding.

  APRICOT SPREAD
  
  1.  In a small saucepan bring the apricots and juice to a boil, cover,
  reduce heat, and simmer very slowly for 45 minutes, or until smooth
  and softened, stirring occasionally.
  
  2.  Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then process in a food
  processor or blender until smooth.
  
  3.  Place in a covered container and chill for 4 to 6 hours or
  overnight. Serve chilled.
  
  *Other dried fruits such as peaches or prunes can be substituted for
  the apricots.
  
  This can be used as a fruit spread on toast, a topping on pies or as a
  natural low-sugar flavoring for plain yogurt.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------MEATBALLS------------------------------
      1 lb Ground round or ground chuck
    1/2 lb Ground pork
  1 1/2 c  Grated cheese - parmesan or
           -Romano or a hard, well aged
           -goat cheese
      2 c  Fine dry bread crumbs
           One good handful dried
           -crushed parsley
      2    Eggs
    3/4 c  Milk
           Salt
           Pepper
           Garlic salt if you want

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 qt Tomato sauce
      1 sm Can tomato paste
      1 pt Whole tomatoes, crushed
           Red wine
           Olive oil
           Salt pork
           Salt, pepper, garlic salt
           -to taste
           Dry sweet basil
           Dry marjoram
      1 sm Onion - optional
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
 
  (optional ingredients: cubed eggplant, mushrooms, fresh sweet red
  pepper pieces, dried crushed hot red chili, black Italian
  olives-chopped, green Greek olives-chopped---and anything else you
  can think of or want)
  
  Prepare the sauce:  Put 2 tbsp of olive oil in a heavy large pot. Cut
  two slices from the salt pork about 1/4" thick each and trim off the
  rind (skin).  Cut up the salt pork into small pieces. Heat up the
  olive oil to medium-high and add the salt pork.  It should just
  barely sizzle. Finely chop up the onion and add it to the pot. Saute
  until the onion becomes translucent.  Add the minced garlic and saute
  just until the garlic begins to turn golden.  At this point you can
  add any of the optional stuff--chop it up to small pieces and stir
  the mixture in the pot well. Add one good handful of crushed dried
  basil, 1 medium handful of crushed dried marjoram and stir everything
  well. Saute all for about 3-4 minutes. Add the can of tomato paste.
  Clean the can out with the wine and add two cans of the wine. Stir
  well and add the whole tomatoes. Salt, pepper, and garlic salt to
  taste and let this cook for about 10 minutes until everything is
  mixed well and bubbly. Add the sauce--adjust the seasonings if you
  like. Reduce the heat to simmer and let cook for about 1 hour.
  
  Prepare the meatballs: Place all ingredients, except the milk, in a
  large bowl and mix well.  If the mixture seems to be very sticky add
  1/2 cup milk and mix well again. We like very soft meatballs and the
  more milk you add the softer the final product will be, so you will
  have to decide how soft you want the meatball to be and adjust the
  milk. I would add all of it. Mix well.  Form a small portion of the
  meat mixture into a ball about 2" in diameter.  Form the rest of the
  meatballs in the same manner. An ice cream scoop makes them just
  about the right size.
  
  You can either fry or bake the meatball (add lots of flavor) or you
  can broil it (removes most of grease and fate). Whichever method you
  use, make sure you cook them to a nice crust on the outside. Drop the
  meatballs into the sauce and simmer for one more hour. Add a little
  water to the sauce if it seems to be real thick.
  
  To make the sandwich - use a crusty roll--hard roll (crusty on the
  outside, soft on the inside)--slice in half. Cut one or two meatballs
  in half and put on one slice of the roll. Spoon a little sauce over
  all, sprinkle with some Italian cheese (parmesan or romano) add a hot
  roasted chili pepper or a sweet roasted pimento--put the other half
  of the roll on top. Open mouth very wide and bite into sandwich.
  Enjoy!

      Title: ITALIAN PESTO CHEESE TORTA
 Categories: Seasonings, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Torta
 
      1 lb Cream cheese; softened
     15 oz Ricotta; drained
    1/2 lb Fresh mozzarella; drained
     12    Fresh basil leaves
      1 c  Toasted pine nuts
    3/4 c  Pesto (see separate recipe)
      1 ts Salt
 
  Line a standard bread pan with a double thickness of fine-weave
  cheesecloth.  Allow enough cheesecloth to fold over the top of the
  mold after the cheese has been layered. Arrange fresh basil leaves in
  a decorative pattern on the cheesecloth and sprinkle on 1 to 2
  tablespoons of the pine nuts.
  
  Combine cream cheese, ricotta, mozzarella, and salt in a food
  processor (or use an electric mixer) and blend until smooth. Place
  one-third of the cheese mixture in the pan and smooth it into an even
  layer. Spread half the pesto over the top and sprinkle on half the
  remaining pine nuts. Repeat these layers, ending with a cheese layer.
  Fold the cheesecloth over the top of the cheese and press slightly to
  even up the mold. Refrigerate one to three days.
  
  To unmold, press down on the cheesecloth to make sure that the cheese
  is firmly in place.  Fold back the top of the cheesecloth and pull up
  on the sides a little to loosen the mold. Invert a serving plate over
  the pan, keeping the cheesecloth away from the top of the mold. Turn
  over the mold together with the plate, then lift the pan off the
  cheese. Peel the cheesecloth carefully off the torta.
  
  Variation: Substitute sun-dried tomato pesto for traditional pesto.
  Arrange whole sun-dried tomatoes, sliced black olives, basil, and
  pine nuts in a decorative pattern in the pan for the top of the torta.

      Title: ITALIAN SAUSAGE & PEPPERS IN TOMATO SAUCE
 Categories: Meats, Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Hot And Mild Italian Sausage
      3 lg Green Bell Peppers
      1 lg Red Bell Pepper
      1 lg Gold Bell Pepper
    1/2 lb Fresh Sliced Mushrooms
      1    Clove Garlic, Minced
      4 lb Jar Ragu Spaghetti Sauce
           Salt And Pepper To Taste
           Oregano To Taste
      3 tb Minced Dry Onion
 
  Remove the casings from the sausages.  In a Dutch oven brown the
  sausages, then slice the sausages into 1/4" slices. Add the Ragu
  sauce to the pot. Remove the stems and seeds from the bell peppers.
  Cook the peppers for 10 minutes on high setting in the microwave or
  you can just add the peppers to the pot if you plan on letting the
  mixture simmer for awhile before serving.  Add mushrooms, peppers,
  garlic, onion, salt and pepper. Heat the mixture over low heat and
  simmer as long as you can. About 15 minutes before serving, heat a
  large pot of water to boiling and cook your choice of pasta,
  preferably a large size pasta or macaroni to al dente. When ready to
  serve, add the cooked and drained pasta to the sausage and pepper
  mixture and enjoy.  This is a great way to have sausage and peppers
  during the winter when the peppers are more expensive than in the
  summer, since it takes a fewer number than "Italian Sausage With
  Green Peppers And Mushrooms".  From: Syd's Cookbook.

  ~------------- ~-- Put the sausage in the freezer until ready to
  prepare. Remove sausage from freezer and separate under running
  water. Once separated take a sharp knife and just cut through the
  casing length wise. The casing will now peal away and can be
  discarded. It's so much better if you do this. Cut the frozen sausage
  into bite sized pieces. Put the sausage into a large cast iron frying
  pan and cook over medium heat until brown. Reduce heat to low. Remove
  the seeds from the peppers and discard. Cut the peppers into bite
  sized pieces. Place the cut up peppers into a microwave proof
  container and microwave approximately 20 minutes on High or until
  they reach your desired doneness. Prepare the Minute Rice per
  directions. Slice 1/2 pound of fresh mushrooms and microwave on High
  for 2-1/2 minutes. Add the cooked peppers and mushrooms to the
  sausage. Add the rice to the whole mixture and mix. This is a very
  nice looking dish and there are never leftovers at my house. From:

           -----INGREDIENTS-----
           Carrots
           Celery
           Radishes
           Salami, polish ham, cold
           Cuts, cut in halves or in
           Triangles
           Cream cheese

           Tuna or deviled ham salad
           Olives, black and green
           Green onions
           Whatever else you want
 
  THIS IS BASICLY AN ANTIPASTO SALAD, MORE OR LESS
  
       Get out a beautiful glass serving tray or any other large
  serving tray and arrang carefully the following:
  
  Make carrot curls.  Use a potato peeler to give you long, thin
  stirps. Roll up strips and crowd, side by side, in a deep bowl. Cover
  with water and chill.
  
  For celery branches, cut vcelery stalk in 3-inch lengths and make
  small slices on each end--not quite trhough to the middle. Place in
  bowl, cover with water and chill.
  
  For radishes, make many "almost through" slices on the tip. They will
  open after they've been placed in a bowl, covered with water and
  chilled. (Carrots will curl, radishes will open, and celery will turn
  into miniature branches if, after they are cut, they are submerged
  into a bowl of cold water and refrigerated a few hours or overnight.)

  (CONTINUED FROM PART ONE)
  
  Salami, Polish ham, or other cold cuts can be cut into halves or
  triangles. If you want to go fancy, soften cream cheese, fill and
  roll up a slice of meat. Secure with a toothpick and green olive.
  
  Cherry tomatoes can be left whole and beautiful or you can cut off
  the very top of them and scoop out the insides. Then fill with tuna
  or deviled ham salad mix. For the added zing, use a little bit of
  horseradish in the tuna or ham.  Dust the tops with parsley.
  
  Olives, black and green, and green onions complete the tray. (You
  might want to top the whole tray off with little pieces of ice here
  and there to keep it all fresh and delicious.) YIELD: Depends on cold
  cuts and vegetables in the Italian Tray.

      1    Tomato; peeled, seeded and

           -squeezed
           Freshly ground black pepper
           ;salt, to taste (optional)
 
  Prepare an ice bath.  Bring 2 cups water to a boil. Add a pinch of
  salt. Blanch the green beans for 1 minute. Drain and plunge into the
  ice bath. Drain and pat dry. Reserve.
  
  Drain the tuna of its oil.  Place it in a bowl and flake it with a
  fork. Add the green beans and all the other ingredients and toss
  well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Chill before serving.
  
  Judi's Notes:  Serve as a salad or eat as a sandwich.
  
  As suggested by the author, I made a couple of open faced sandwiches
  with crusty french bread using this mixture. It was delicious. I
  mixed a little olive oil, lemon juice, and a clove of minced garlic
  together and spread it on the bread, then placed the tuna mixture on
  top. It serves 2 people but found the amount not to be enough. Double
  ingredients if you are hungry! Adapted recipe from: Salads by Leonard
  Schwartz.

      1 c  Vegetable stock
    1/8 ts Red pepper flakes; crushed

      1 ts Dried basil
      1 c  Mediterranean black olives;

   Place the eggplant in a colander and toss with 1 teaspoon of the
  salt. Let stand for 1 hour to draw out the bitter juices. Rinse well,
  drain and pat dry with kitchen towels.
  
   Heat 2 tbs of the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the
  eggplant and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 4
  minutes. (You may have to add a little more oil if the eggplant
  sticks). Transfer to a plate and set aside.
  
   Heat the remaining 2 tbs oil in the pan, and add the onion, celery,
  bell pepper, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about
  5 minutes. Stir in the reserved eggplant, the potatoes, the tomatoes
  with their puree, vegetable stock, the remaining 1/2 tsp salt, and
  the red pepper flakes; if using dried basil, add it now. Bring to a
  simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring
  occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes to 1
  hour.
  
   Stir in the olives and, if using, the fresh basil, and continue
  cooking to blend the flavors, about 5 minutes. Serve the stew hot,
  warm or at room temperature.

 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 pk (1-1/8 teaspoons) active
           Dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
    3/4 c  Warm water
  1 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
    3/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Shortening
           Olive oil for the tops
 
  "This is an adaptation of Italian focaccia. It is one of the most
  crispy and crunchy crackers, as well as one of the most substantial.
  Try serving Focaccia Crackers with soft cheese or garlic-flavored
  cream cheese. It is somewhat more difficult to make than most other
  crackers, but worth twice the trouble. 375~F. 20 to 30 minutes
  
  In a small bowl, combine the yeast with the sugar and 1/4 cup of the
  warm water. Set aside in a warm place until the mixture starts to
  foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  Combine the flours and salt in a large bowl or in the food processor.
  Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir
  in the yeast mixture and the remaining 1/2 cup warm water. Blend to
  form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Knead well by hand for about 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface
  or by pulsing about 25 seconds in the food processor. Knead until the
  dough is smooth and springy to the touch.
  
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn it over to coat all
  sides. Cover with a damp towel and set the dough in a warm place
  until it has doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface or
  pastry cloth. Roll it into a rectangular shape approximately 1/4 inch
  thick. Place the dough on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
  sheet, cover with a damp towel, and let it rise for another 35 to 45
  minutes.
  
  Using both hands, gently push your fingertips all over the top of the
  risen dough, leaving indentations throughout. Cover it with a damp
  towel again and put in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about
  1-1/2 to
        2    hours.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375~F. With your fingers or a soft pastry brush,
  lightly brush the top with olive oil. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes,
  until very crisp. Cool on a rack. When cooled, break into small,
  irregularly shaped pieces, or into 2 large crackers that can be
  broken off as they are nibbled.
  
  VARIATIONS: Sprinkle the top of the dough with rosemary, basil, or
  your favorite herb after brushing with the olive oil.

MMMMM------------------------ALYCE MANTIA-----------------------------
      4 md Boiling potatoes (about 2lb)
           -salted water
      1    Egg yolk; lightly beaten
      1    Cup flour
           Additional flour to knead

      1 tb Butter
      1    Clove garlic; very finely
           -minced
      1 c  Heavy cream
      4 oz Gorgonzola
    1/4 c  Toasted walnuts; chopped
 
         -ALYCE MANTIA        Amy, here is what I do: Take 4 medium
  boiling potatoes (about 2 lbs). Boil in salted water until tender (30
  minutes or so?).  Drain and peel. Return to pan and mash over low
  heat with a potato masher until no lumps remain. Remove from heat and
  mix in 1 egg yolk, lightly beaten, and about a cup of flour. When
  well blended, turn onto a floured board and knead in more flour (may
  take as much as another cup, probably more like 1/2 cup) until soft
  and pliable but not too sticky. Cut in 4 pieces and roll each into a
  rope about as thick as your thumb. Cut into 1" lengths. Hold a fork,
  tines down, on the board with the curved side away from you.  Roll
  each piece against the tines to make the little indentations about
  1/2 way round and curve slightly (you really don't have to do this
  but it looks cute, and IS authentic). Place on a floured baking sheet
  as you do them. You can either cook right away or keep a few hours,
  uncovered, in the fridge.  Try this sauce over them: Melt 1 tbsp
  butter in a medium pan.  Add 1 clove garlic, very finely minced. Stir
  a couple of times and add 1 cup heavy cream. Cook, stirring
  constantly, until reduced to about 3/4 cup.  Add 4 oz Gorgonzola and
  stir until melted. Now drop the gnocchi into boiling salted water and
  cook until they just rise to the top, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove to a
  heated platter with a slotted spoon or skimmer as they come up.  Pour
  the sauce over them and sprinkle with 1/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts
  and serve at once. This is very rich, but WONDERFUL!  Let me know if
  this works. Regards from Memphis, Alyce

      Title: ITALIAN-STYLE BEANS & PASTA
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 cn Garbanzo beans
      1 cn Great Northern Beans
      1 cn Red kidney beans
      1    Or 2 cans diced cooked
           Tomatoes
      2 lg Carrots
      1    Or 2 large onions, chopped
      2    To 6 cloves of chopped
           Garlic
      2 lg Carrots, cut in thin strips
      2    Stalks celery, cut in
           Chunks
      3    To 4 heaping Tbsps of
           Italian Seasoning
    1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
    1/2 lb Pasta
 
  Saute garlic and onion till soft.  Add beans (entire can) and
  tomatoes and 3 ca ns of water. When hot, add Italian Seasoning. Bring
  to a boil, then cook till sp ices are well-blended. Add pasta,
  carrots and celery and cook till pasta is ready - - about ten
  minutes. Carrots should be slightly crunchy.  Adjust seasonings if
  desired. This makes a thick stew. If you like it wetter, use more
  water.
  
  I expect you could lower the fat by reducing the amount of beans.
  This is an adaptation of a recipe calling for sausage and other meat.
  You can add non-fat Parmesan cheese at the table if you want.
  
  Serves 8 or 9.

      Title: ITALIAN-STYLE HOT COCOA
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Cocoa powder
    1/3 c  White sugar
      1 ts Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Water
 
  Mix in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Once this
  mixture comes to a boil, add 2 cups of liquid (water, brewed coffee,
  skim milk; the author recommended a cup of water and skim milk each)
  and stir over heat until heated through and mixed.
  
  This produces a thick, quite rich brew, not for children, but highly
  chocolate-concentrated.  Clearly, it's pretty much just empty
  calories, but not that much of them, and the fat is only what comes
  in your cocoa. Of course, the New Yorker article claimed that the
  flavor varies greatly with the brand of cocoa powder that you use--he
  recommended some Italian varieties that I've been unable to find--but
  he found that basic Hershey's was more than adequate.

      Title: J.MEYER HUNGARIAN GYPY BACON (CIGANYSZALONNA)
 Categories: Pork, Hungary
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  My father was born in Romania. His Grandfather taught him how to make
  Gypsy Bacon over the campfire and he taught his children. I remember
  sitting around the camp fire in the local Forest Preserve, holding a
  stick with a chunk of smoked bacon over the coals. Potatos were
  buried in the embers and opened cans of pork and beans were standing
  on stones in the campfire. Someone was alway dropping their bacon on
  the dirt or the grass. Pick it up and burn off the dirt. Eat it.
  Delicious.
  
  Regards, June Meyer. Prepare a smoked cured slab of bacon, with the
  rind still attached, by scoring it in 1 inch square sections down to
  the rind. Cut off a 3 by 3 inch secton for each person. Skewer it on
  a long fork or stick and hold it over the fire until the bacon starts
  to cook and sizzle and the rind shrinks and curls up the bacon
  sections. Is your mouth watering yet? Sprinkle paprika over bacon,
  eat by cutting off an inch cube with a knife and topping it with
  chopped sweet onion and hearty rye bread. Serve with cold beer and
  Schnapps chasers. The taste is wonderful, good on those cold nights
  around the campfire.
  
  This type of bacon can be bought at german or hungarian deli or meat
  markets. The bacon is firm, not soft. It is cured in a way which
  permits you to also eat it in thin slices on bread as an appetizer.

  I find it amusing that in my kitchen, I have all the latest culinary
  gadgets, from coffee bean grinders, cusinarts, can openers, coffee
  makers, juicers, and so on, to aid me in my cooking adventures, yet
  when I want cole slaw I get out my hand held "Rapid Slaw Cutter"
  (cica 1950). Made by the Bluffton Slaw Cutter Co. Bluffton, Ohio.
  This non-technical hand held cutter sold for about 39 cents way back
  then. It cuts the cabbage into delicate strands of slaw. Better than
  any Cusinart can. If you frequent garage sales, or estate sales, you
  may be lucky enough to find a used one. Frequent use will keep it
  sharp. My cutter is willed to my son. Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Wash hands and take off rings. Place your hands into the slaw, mix and
  squeeze the slaw so it makes some juice. This will make the slaw limp.
  Taste, add more salt if needed. Refrigerate till serving time. Good
  the next day also. Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: J.MEYER'S AUTH HUNGARIAN CUCUMBER SALAD W/SOU
 Categories: Hungary, Canning, Condiment
      Yield: 1 Qt
 
      4    Cucumbers
      1 sm Clove of garlic
      1 ts Suger
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Good vinegar (not red)
    3/4 c  Real sour cream
 
  This cucumber salad is by far one of the most delicious and refreshing
  salads you can eat. It has a wonderful cucumber flavor that is
  enhanced by the garlic and sour cream. Originally this was a summer
  salad to accompany roast meat or chicken dishes. Now that we have
  cucumbers available all year round we can enjoy this dish all year.
  
  I use a slaw slicer to slice the cucumber thinly enough to see
  through! As a child I always enjoyed peeling and then grooving the
  cucumbers with the tines of a fork before my mother would slice them.
  I loved the refreshing cool cucumber spray that would mist my face.
  Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Peel cukes. Drag fork tines down length of peeled cucumbers to create
  long groves that will look very nice when you slice cucumbers very,
  very thin. Put in mixing bowl.
  
  Peel and chop clove of garlic. Add Salt and suger slices. Mix in sour
  cream. Add vinegar (I like to use "Marukan seasoned gourmet Rice
  Vinegar" orange label) and toss well, I use my hands, till cucumbers
  slices and sour cream are all frothy and foamy.
  
  Place in serving dish and sprinkle a little paprika on top for
  decoration, and serve well chilled.
  
  This will stay good in refridgerator for a few days. Serves 4. WALT

  There are two kinds of cole slaw served in Hungarian households. One
  is the oil and vinegar slaw that is usually served in Winter, and the
  other is this recipe for sour cream cole slaw that does not contain
  any oil. It is a light, refreshing slaw, creamy and zesty. A perfect
  salad to accompany a summer meal. Regards, June Meyer.

      1 ts Dried dill weed, OR
      1 tb Fresh, dill weed
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Oil
    1/4 lb (4 ounces) Jack cheese,
           Shredded (1 to 1-1/2 cups,
           Loosely packed)
    1/3 c  Water
 
  "Monterey Jack cheese and dill go surprisingly well together. These
  are unusual crackers with a smooth texture. They are tasty hors
  d'oeurves all by themselves. 325~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven
  to 325~F.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour, dill,
  salt, and pepper. Add the oil and mix until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal. Add the cheese and mix thoroughly so the cheese is
  coated evenly.
  
  Slowly blend in enough of the water to form a dough that will hold
  together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions
  for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll each out to
  1/8-inch.
  
  With a sharp knife, cut the rolled dough into 2-inch squares. Place
  them on an ungreased baking sheet, making sure their edges do not
  touch. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn them over and continue baking
  another 5 to 10 minutes, or until they are medium brown. Cool on a
  rack. Yield: 50-60.
  
  VARIATIONS: Experiment with different kinds of cheeses, seeds, and
  herbs. Cheddar and thyme are a good combination.

MMMMM-----------------------WHISKEY SAUCE----------------------------
      1 lb WHITE MUSHROOMS; sliced
      6    GREEN ONIONS; chopped
      2 tb BUTTER
      2 oz JACK DANIEL'S WHISKEY
      2 c  BROWN SAUCE*
 
  Have the butcher split two small fryers or if you prefer, buy cut-up
  chicken pieces. Place the chicken in a shallow pan and douse with
  whiskey. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the pieces; marinate for 2
  hours. Soak some wood chips (they specify Jack Daniel's Barrel chips)
  in water--if you're using regular wood chips, I'd suggest soaking
  them in whiskey? While the chips are soaking, build a charcoal fire
  in your barbecue grill. Use the wood chips in your grill to create a
  good smoking fire. Broil the fryvers over the pit until well cooked.
  Serve with whiskey sauce. FOR WHISKEY SAUCE: Saute the mushrooms and
  green onion in butter until tender. Add whiskey and brown sauce and
  simmer until flavors have blended and the alcohol has evaporated.
  Keep warm until serving time. * BROWN SAUCE - To make Brown Sauce;
  thicken beef bouillon with cornstarch or roux. Or better yet, make it
  from scratch.

      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2 tb Butter
      8 oz Tomato sauce
           -(1 large can)
      4 oz Green chili peppers,
           -chopped (1 can)
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Eggs, slightly beaten
      1 c  Half-and-half
           -(or light cream)
     11 oz Corn chips (one package)
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese
           -(cut into 1/2 inch cubes)
    1/2 c  Cheddar cheese (shredded)
           Paprika
      1 c  Sour cream
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Saute onion in butter until
  transparent. Stir in tomato sauce, chopped peppers and salt. Simmer 5
  minutes. Remove from heat. Combine eggs and cream. Stir into sauce.
  
  Place half the corn chips in bottom of a 1 1/2 quart casserole. Add in
  layers, half the Monterey Jack cheese, half the sauce. Repeat. Top
  with sour cream. Sprinkle with shredded cheddar cheese and paprika.
  Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A casserole made with jack cheese -- I got this recipe from the
  National Dairy Council.  It's good winter food; easy to make and rich.
  
  Don't let the corn chips put you off; normally, such an ingredient
  would make me think it's one of those recipes for people who don't
  like to cook and don't care about good food. Take my word for it:
  this recipe is an exception.
  
  *  Ingredient notes for non-US cooks:  Monterey Jack cheese is a bland
  American cheddar from Monterey, California. Try substituting Dunlop
  (Scottish), Lancashire (English), or Cantal (French). Half and half
  is a dairy product that is 50 percent whole milk and 50 percent heavy
  cream; light cream makes a reasonable substitute. Corn chips, often
  sold as "Fritos" or "Doritos," are a packaged snack food made of
  deep-fried pressed cornmeal. I cannot think of any reasonable
  substitute for them in this recipe.  [Ed.]

  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.

  In 1950 a man named Robert O'Petersen built the first Jack-In-The-Box
  restaurant at El Cahon and 63rd streets in San Diego. The restaurant
  was origanally built for drive-thru and walk-up service
  only--customers would speak into a clown's mouth to order their food.
  The clown was blasted to smithereens with explosives in a 1980
  advertising campaign, however, signifying a shift toward a more
  diverse adult menu.
       The Jumbo Jack hamburger has been on the menu since 1974.

        3 TB white wine vinegar
  
  Soak tomatillos in warm water and remove dry husks. Dip tomatoes in
  boiling water for 30 sec.  or hold over a gas flame and char. Remove
  skins and squeeze out seeds. (I ignored this and just opened a large
  can of stewed tomatoes.)
  
  ROUGHLY puree everything. Simmer in an open 2 quart saucepan for 5
  minutes to blend flavors and help preserve the salsa. Salsa keeps
  well. If you want salsa even hotter, just add more jalapenos or keep
  more seeds. (I didn't have jalapenos, so just added some cayenne and
  some tabasco to taste. I also found that about a tablespoon of lime
  juice was nice.)
  
  Obviously not a gourmet recipe.  But it turned out very nice, and
  solves the problem of what to do with the other 90% of the cilantro I
  buy every week or two. From: rec.food.cooking -

      Yield: 14 Servings
 
           Vegetable oil
      1 c  Blue cornmeal**
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar

      1    Medium red bell pepper;
           Deveined, seeded, chopped
      2 tb Melted butter
 
  **Blue cornmeal is available in Mexican specialty stores and the
  ethnic department of major supermarkets. Blue cornmeal originated in
  Santa Fe, New Mexico, where the dark exotic corn is a staple. Blue
  cornmeal is coarser, heavier, and nuttier tasting than yellow
  cornmeal. One may be substituted for the other quite easily. Using a
  cast-iron corn or muffin pan produces a delicious crunchy crust. The
  chile adds bite, while the sweet, mild bell pepper adds color.
  Preheat oven to 425F. Liberally grease a corn stick pan with the
  vegetable oil. In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, salt,
  sugar, and baking powder. In a small separate bowl, beat the eggs
  with the milk. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the wet
  ingredients all at once. Stir just to combine, the batter will be
  lumpy. Gently fold in the peppers and butter. Fill the molds almost
  to the top with the batter and bake 20 minutes. Serve warm with lots
  of butter.

 Categories: Bread
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
  2 1/4 oz Envelope active dry yeast
           -or 2 3/5-ounce cakes fresh
      1 tb Sugar
  2 1/4 c  Lukewarm water

           -chopped*
      2 c  Shredded sharp cheddar

           Egg GLAZE
      1    Egg
      1 tb Water
           Cornmeal for sprinkling
 
  Serving Size  : TWO 9- BY 5-INCH LOAVES OR 24 BREAD STICKS 1.
  Sprinkle the dry yeast or crumble the fresh yeast and Sugar Over 1/2
  cup of the lukewarm water in a cup or smaII bowl. Leave it for 10
  minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast. Add the remaining water and
  oil. 2. Sift the flours together into a large mixing bowl. Set aside
  2 cups of the mixture. Add the salt to the remaining mixture and make
  a well in center. Pour the yeast mixture into the well, add the
  chopped chiles, and mix briefly. 3. Gradually stir in the reserved
  flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough loses its stickiness and
  can be kneaded easily. Knead the dough thoroughly on a floured
  surface until it is smooth and elastic, flouring the surface
  Occasionally if the dough sticks to it. Transfer the dough to an
  oiled bowl and turn it over to oil its entire surface. Cover with a
  damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1/2 hours or
  until doubled in volume. Punch down the dough and let it rest, about
  5 minutes, covered with a cloth. (This allows the dough to regain its
  elasticity.) 4. Knead the dough again on a lightly floured surface.
  Knead in the cheese by sprinkling it on the bread all at once and
  kneading until distributed. 5. Grease two 9- by 5-inch loaf pans.
  Divide the dough into 2 equal parts and on the floured surface roll
  out each part to a smooth, cylindrical loaf about 9 inches long. Put
  the loaves in the pans seam side down, slash the top lightly 3 times
  with a serrated knife, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a
  warm place for about 1 hour or until nearly doubled in volume. 6. For
  the egg glaze, whisk the egg and water together until slightly foamy.
  Brush the loaves with the egg glaze. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal.
  Preheat the oven to 375F. 7. Bake the loaves for about 15 minutes or
  until they begin to brown. Reduce the temperature to 350F and
  continue baking for another 45 minutes or until the bread sounds
  hollow when tapped. Let the loaves cool on a rack. Serve lukewarm or
  at room temperature.

           Cheese (1/2 pound)
           EGG GLAZE
      1    Egg
      1 tb Water
           Cornmeal for sprinkling
 
  1.  Sprinkle the dry yeast or crumble the fresh yeast and sugar Over
  1/2 cup of the lukewarm water in a cup or small bowl. Leave it for 10
  minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast. Add the remaining water and

  continue baking for another 45 minutes or until the bread sounds
  hollow when tapped. Let the loaves cool on a rack. Serve lukewarm or
  at room temperature.
  
  ADVANCE Preparation: This bread is best on the day it is baked. NOTE:
  If you're using a food processor to knead the dough, add the chiles
  and cheese by hand so that the pieces stay intact.
  
  NOTES : WHETHER YOU BAKE this in a loaf or make the rustic bread
  sticks, you'll enjoy this spicy but not overpowering California-style
  bread. The spiciness of the bread can be altered by increasing or
  reducing the number of jalapeno chiles. This bread goes nicely with
  frittata or scrambled eggs.

  2 1/2 lb Clover honey
  1 1/2 oz Cascade Hops

      1    Or 2 pk yeast
    3/4 c  Corn sugar
      3 g  Water
 
  Add the malt extract, honey, jalapenos and boiling hops to 3 gallons
  of water and bring to a boil. As it reaches a boil and the odor of the
  jalapenos begins to become obvious, filter out the jalapenos. Boil
  for 60 minutes, add the finishing hops in the final 10 minutes.
  Sparge into the fermenter, charge with the yeast when cool. Add the
  corn sugar and bottle after ageing for 2 weeks. (this was a little
  mild, if doing this again, I'd let the jalapenos steep a little bit
  longer). WALT Curt Snyder

  Jalapeno Pasta: In a large mixing bowl, place all of the ingredients
  and knead them with an electric mixer, (or use a dough hook), for 10
  minutes, or until a soft dough is formed. On a flat, floured surface,
  roll out the dough so that is is 1/8 inch thick. Cut the dough
  lengthwise into 1/4 inch wide strips. Hang the strips over a wooden
  rod, like a broom handle, for 2 hours (minimum) so that they dry.
  Cook the pasta al dente and drain it. Serve it with the Scallop Sauce
  on top.
  
  Scallop Sauce: In a large skillet place the olive oil and heat it on
  medium high until it's hot. Add the garlic and saute it for 45
  seconds, or until it begins to turn brown. Add the sea scallops and
  cook them on 1 side for 1 minute. Remove the scallops and place them
  on a warm plate. To the skillet add the cilantro, tarragon and white
  wine. Cook the ingredients for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is
  reduced by half. Add the scallops (place the uncooked sides down in
  the pan) and cook them for 4 minutes.

      3 c  Flour, all-purpose
    1/4 c  Flour, rice
    1/4 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Water; lukewarm

MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
      4 c  Sugar, granulated

      2 ts Food coloring, yellow
    1/8 ts Food coloring, red
      1 ts Rose water
        x  Oil, vegetable
 
    Batter: In deep bowl, make a smooth batter of the flours, baking
  powder and lukewarm water. Let batter rest unrefrigerated and
  uncovered 12 hours.
    Syrup: Immediately before frying the jalebis, combine sugar, cold
  water and cream of tarter in 4 qt. saucepan. Stir over moderate heat
  until sugur dissolves. Increase heat to high and cook briskly,
  undisturbed for 5 minutes, until 220F on a candy thermometer. Remove
  from heat, stir in coloring and rose water. Pour into a bowl and set
  aside.
    Jalebis: Pour 3 cups vegetable oil into a 10" karhai or 12" wok or
  into a deep fryer to 2-3 inches. Heat oil to 350F. Spoon 1 1/2 cups
  of the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a plain tube 3/16"
  diameter. Squeezing batter directly into hot oil, loop a stream of
  batter back and forth 4-5 times to form a sort of pretzel made up of
  alternating figure 8s and circles, one over the other. Each jalebi
  should be about 3" long and 2" wide.
    In batches of 5-6, fry the jalebis for 2 minutes, or until golden
  on both sides. As they brown, transfer them to the syrup for a
  minute, then place them on a plate. Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Title: JAM COOKIES
 Categories: Bakery, Cookies, Vegetarian, Mark's
      Yield: 13 Cookies
 
    3/4 c  Rolled oats
  1 1/2 c  Wholewheat flour
    1/4 c  Oil
    1/2 c  Maple syrup, or other liquid
           -- sweetener
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ds Almond extract
           Raspberry or other fruit jam
           -- as needed
 
  Place the oats in a blender & grind until you have a flour. Place in a
  mixing bowl with the remaining ingredients. Mix well. If the mixture
  seems too wet, add a little more flour. You want a dough that is
  stiff enough to hold together when you place it on a cookie sheet.
  
  Divide the dough into 13 portions.  Roll each portion in your hands
  into a ball & place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Press down so
  that the cookie dough is flattened & make a thumb imprint in the
  centre of each cookie. Fill the indentation with jam (raspberry is my
  favourite for this, but any flavour could be used).
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350F for 20 minutes or until the cookies
  are cooked through & lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See Below
 
  Select fully ripened fruits and rinse them quickly under cold water
  and then drain thoroughly.  Do not soak the fruit in water. Do not
  double the recipes. Do not substitute ingredients. Do not reduce the
  amount of sugar or increase the amount of fruit used. An exact
  balance of fruit, sugar, and pectin is needed for jelling to occur.
  For no cook jams, mash the fruit with a potato masher.  For cooked
  jams, process the fruit in a food processor using quick on and off
  pulses until finely chopped. For preserves, until coarsely chopped.
  Do NOT puree.
  
  NOTE:
  
  A rolling boil is a boil that cannot be stirred down.

MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
      2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Solid shortening
    1/4 c  (1/2 stick) margarine
    1/3 c  Cold water

MMMMM------------------------MEAT FILLING-----------------------------
      2 tb Margarine
      1    Small white onion,
           Finely chopped
    1/4 ts Chopped Scotch Bonnet pepper
    1/2 lb Lean ground beef
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly groun black pepper
    1/2 ts Curry powder
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
    1/4 c  Breadcrumbs
    1/4 c  Beef or chicken stock
      1    Egg, beaten
    1/4 c  Water
 
  Note: Scotch Bonnet pepper is a very hot pepper native to Jamaica and
  the Caribbean islands. Try to find it at your area's West Indian
  grocery stores, or use jalapenos as a substitute. Also known as
  habinera peppers. 1. Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Cut
  in the shortening and margarine until crumbly. Add the cold water to
  make a stiff dough. Lightly flour a wooden cutting board and roll out
  the dough until about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out 8 inch circles. Cover
  with wax paper or damp cloth until ready to use. 2. In a heavy
  skillet, melt the margarine and saute the onion and Scotch Bonnet
  Pepper until they become limp. Add the ground beef, salt, pepper,
  curry powder and thyme and mix well. Brown the meat for about 10
  minutes, stirring occasionaly. 3. Add the breadcrumbs and stock and
  combine all the ingredients well. Cover the skillet and simmer for
  about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. When all the liquids
  have been absorbed, the filling is ready. It should be moist but not
  watery. Remove the skillet from the stove and preheat oven to 400
  degrees F. 4. Uncover the dough circles and place 2 to 3 tablespoons
  of filling on halfof each. Moisten the edges of the dough with water
  and fold the dough circle over the meat filling. Pinch the edges
  closed with a fork. Lightly brush the pastry with a mixture of the
  egg and water. Bake on a lightly greased baking sheet for 30 to 40
  minutes or until the pastry is golden brown. Yield: 10 patties.

      In a large bowl, combine the allspice, thyme, cayenne pep- per,
  black pepper, sage, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, garlic powder and sugar.
  With a wire whisk, slowly add the olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar,
  orange juice, and lime juice.  Add the Scotch bonnet pepper,. onion,
  and green onions and mix well.  Add the chicken breasts, cover and
  marinate for at least 1 hour, longer if possible.
      Preheat an outdoor grill.
      Remove the breasts from the marinade and grill for 6 minutes on
  each side or until fully cooked.  While grilling, baste with the
  marinade.
      Heat the leftover marinade and serve on the side for dipping.
      NOTE:  This is the recipe as listed in the cookbook. Per-
  sonally, I would NEVER heat the leftover marinade and serve on the
  side for dipping, especially something that you had marinated POULTRY
  in. A MUCH better idea would be to reserve some of the marinade
  (BEFORE you put the chicken in it) and save it for serving.
      This recipe is also from Sugar Reef Caribbean Cooking by Devra
  Dedeaux. "This recipe is not as hot as you would find in Jamaica. For
  that authentic flavor, double the quantity of dry spices."

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Inner Beauty or
           Other Caribbean hot sauce
           Or-
     10    Pureed Habaneros OR
     15    Chile peppers -- pureed
      2 tb Dried rosemary
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      2 tb Dried basil
      2 tb Dried thyme
      2 tb Mustard seeds
      3    Scallions -- finely chopped
      1 ts Salt and black pepper
      2    Limes -- juice only
    1/4 c  Cheap yellow mustard
      2 tb Orange juice
      2 tb White vinegar
 
  Combine all ingredients in a food processor or blender; blend them
  into a paste, making sure that all the ingredients are fully
  integrated. The paste should be approximately the consistency of a
  thick tomato sauce. If it is too thick, thin it out with a little
  more white vinegar. Cover paste and let it sit in the refrigerator
  for at least 2 hours for the flavors to blend together. Overnight is
  the ideal amount of time to give them to get acquainted. (Note: If
  you want to avoid making a fresh batch every time you make this dish,
  you can multiply the amount of paste easily. Don't worry about it
  going bad, since it keeps almost infinitely). Rub paste on meat and
  grill.

  Another dish you could try is Coconut Shrimp.  Just deep fry some
  shrimp in a batter to which you've added some shredded coconut. A
  good dipping sauce would be crushed pineapple with a couple of good
  dollops of a West Indian Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce, like Matouk's or

      Title: JAMAICAN JERK SAUCE #2
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      4    Dried Habanero chiles
           -- or more, (ground)
    1/3 c  Onion powder
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground allspice
      1 ts Ground black pepper
      1 ts Dried thyme
      2 ts Dried cinnamon
      2 ts Dried nutmeg
 
  Another dish you could try is Coconut Shrimp.  Just deep fry some
  shrimp in a batter to which you've added some shredded coconut. A
  good dipping sauce would be crushed pineapple with a couple of good
  dollops of a West Indian Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce, like Matouk's or
  Mabel's or Hak Has. To soak up the heat, serve some fried plantains
  and rice, and plenty of Red Stripe.

      2    Pork tenderloins (1-1/2 lb)
    1/2 c  Onions, chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, slivered
    1/2 sm Hot pepper
      2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce

    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/4 ts Curry powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
 
  Choose pork tenderloins that are at least 3/4 lb each. Jamaican in
  origin, this dish can be prepared with chicken breasts or legs, too.
  If you like your food spicy hot, simply increase the amount of hot
  pepper.
  
  If fresh hot peppers are unavailable, use 1/2 ts hot pepper sauce, or
  reduce amount to suit your family. You can also use 1/2 ts dried
  ground ginger when fresh is not at hand.
  
  Trim pork tenderloins; place in shallow glass dish. Set aside.
  
  In food processor, pure onions, garlic, hot pepper, soy sauce, oil,
  orange and lemon rinds, orange juice, ginger, thyme, cinnamon,
  allspice, nutmeg, curry powder, salt and pepper.
  
  Pour onion mixture over pork tenderloins, turning to coat all sides.
  cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to
  8 hours, turning pork occasionally.
  
  Reserving marinade, transfer pork to foil-lined rimmed baking sheet.
  Broil, basting once with marinade, for about 20 minutes or until meat
  is browned but still has hint of pink inside. Tent with foil; let
  stand for
       10    minutes before serving. PA_Meadows@msn.com

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Ribs or 1 chicken cut up
    3/4 c  Onions -- chopped
      4 lg Clove
      2 tb Allspice
      1 tb Vinegar
      2 tb Salad oil
      1 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Salt
     12    Bay leaf soaked in hot water
      1    Hour
           Garlic -- minced
 
  PEPPERS: You can control the heat with the type of peppers you use.
  Between the marinade and the cooking, a lot of the heat will be lost,
  so dont be afraid to throw a couple of whatever hot peppers you have
  on hand. I use 2 large cayennes, 2-4 chilies, and a token jalapeno.
  The preperation: combine everything except the bay leafs and the meat
  in a large zip lock bag. Add meat and thouroughly mix. Let marinate
  in the fridge at least 2 hours preferably until the next day. Fire up
  the bbq. Remove meat fromthe bag wiuth as much as the marinade as
  possible still clinging to it. Place half of the bay leafs on the
  meat. Dump the remaining marinade or use it as insect repellant. Cook
  very slowly over medium heat turning often. If your grill has a
  vented hood close it . Do not let meat burn. Cover and cook about 1/2
  hour. After 1/2 hour remove the bay leaf, turn meat, place the
  remaining bay leaves on the meat and cook till done (About 1/2-3/4
  hours more depending on the heat). Eat. Break out the beer. You'll
  need it.

  Take coconut out of shell and process or grate it in the water, then
  squeeze it through double-layered cheesecloth. Use only the liquid;
  throw gratings away. It works better if you let it sit for an hour or
  so before sieving. Cook the beans in the coconut milk for one hour
  (simmering). Chop onion and scallions and add with thyme, allspice,
  garlic, 1 tsp salt and 2 lbs rice. Add water to cover + one inch over
  top of rice and beans mixture. (use 1st knuckle to guess). Bring to a
  boil, turn down heat and simmer, covered, 40 minutes or until rice is

      Title: JAMAICAN RICE & PEAS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Grains
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Kidney beans (red), dry
           Coconut milk (see note)
      1    Thyme, sprigfresh
      1 cl Gralic, crushed
      1    Green onion, chopped
      3 sl Hot Pepper
  2 1/4 c  Rice (uncooked)
           Salt (to taste)
 
  In a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, place the washed
  beans. Add the coconut milk and bring to boil. Reduce the heat. Cook
  until the beans are tender, 1 to 2 hours. Add the thyme, garlic,
  green onion, and salt. Add the hot pepper if desired. Simmer for a
  few minutes. Add the rice.
  
  The liquid should come up to 1-inch above the rice. Add water if
  needed. Cover the pot.  Bring to a boil again. Reduce the heat to
  low. Cook for 15 minutes (for regular rice) to 20 minutes (for
  parboiled). It should not be necessary to add more water, but if to
  much liquid boils away, replace it with boiling water.
  
  The rice is ready when the liquid disappears and the grains of rice
  are separate.  Stir just before serving to evenly distribute the red
  kidney beans. Makes 4 to
        6    servings.
  
  NOTE:  For coconut milk, crack 1 mature coconut with a hammer, cut off
     the brown shell, and grate the coconut meat.  Into a bowl, add
     the coconut meat and 6 cups of water.  Mix well, then squeeze to
     extract as much liquid as possible.  Press through a sieve and
     use as directed above.
  
     Etoria says his preferred method to separate the coconut
     meat from the brown shell is with a butter knife ("or the
     dullest knife you have") to prevent cuts.  Slip the knife
     between the white flesh and the shell, and it should come
     away easily.

      3    To 4-pound slab of pork
           -spareribs
    3/4 c  Coarsely chopped onion
      4    Cloves garlic, quartered

           -jalapeno peppers, seeded
           -and chopped
      2 tb Ground allspice
      1 tb Minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Salad oil
      1 ts Ground nutmeg
      1 ts Salt
           About 12 fresh bay leaves *
           Lime-Dressed Avocado
           -(recipe below)
      1 lg Papaya [VERY optional, S.C.]
 
  * Or dry bay leaves soaked in water for about 1 hour.
  
  Grilling time: 1 to 1 1/4 hours
  
  Made this for dinner Sunday.  Thought the ribs got a tad over done.
  Next time I'll cut the cooking time by about fifteen minutes. The
  recipe doesn't call this a "jerk" type dish, but the spices are
  similar and the slashes in the meat are right up that alley.
  
  Make 1/4-inch-deep slashes between ribs on both sides of spareribs
  slab.
  
  In a food processor or blender, combine onion, garlic, jalapeno
  peppers, allspice, ginger, oil, nutmeg and salt. Whirl until pureed.
  Rub spice puree over surface and into slashes on both sides of
  spareribs slab. cover and let stand for 1 to 2 hours (or refrigerate
  until next day).
  
  Barbecue ribs by indirect heat.  Distribute bay leaves over meaty
  sides of ribs; then place ribs, meat side up, on grill directly above
  drip pan. Cover barbecue and adjust dampers as necessary to maintain
  an even heat. Cook until ribs are well browned on outside and meat
  near bone is no longer pink; cut to test (1 to 1 1/4 hours). Near end
  of cooking time, prepare Lime-Dressed Avocado; also cut papaya into
  wedges.
  
  To serve, cut spareribs into 2- to 3-rib portions. Arrange on a large
  platter with avocados and papayas. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  LIME-DRESSED AVOCADO:
  
  In a small bowl, stir together 3 tablespoons each lime juice and
  salad oil, 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon each red pepper flakes
  and oregano leaves.  Season to taste with salt.
  
  Cut 3 large ripe avocados in half lengthwise; pit, but do not peel.
  Pour equal amounts of lime dressing into each avocado cavity, making
  sure all cut surfaces are coated.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      1 c  Finely chopped green peppers
      1 c  Finely chopped celery
      2 c  Finely chopped onion
      1 cl Garlic, minced
    1/2 c  Tomato puree
      1 cn (16 oz) tomatoes OR
      1 c  Ripe tomtoes, peeled, seeded

      1    Recipe shrimp broth OR
      7 c  Fish stock
    1/2 ts Dried thyme

  1 1/2 c  Raw rice (Texmati, if it's
           -available)
      2 c  Shucked oysters
      1 lb Fresh crab meat, picked over
      1 c  Finely chopped green onions
 
  BROTH: Peel and devein the shrimp and set the meat aside. Put the
  shells and other ingredients into a medium saucepan and bring to a
  boil. Reduce the heat and simmer 20 minutes. Strain the broth through
  a chinois or seive.  Much of the flavor is in the shells, so press
  and pound with a heavy spoon or pestle until all the moisture has
  been extracted. Discard shell residue and reserve broth. STEW: Drop
  the sausage pieces into a large, heated saucepan or casserole and
  sear over medium-high heat. Stir frequently.  Cook for about 10
  minutes. The sausage will render considerable fat as it cooks.  Pour
  off and discard all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.
      Add the ham pieces and continue cooking, stirring often, for an
  additional 10 minutes.
      Add the peppers, celery, onions, and garlic. Scrape the bottom
  with a wooden spoon or spatula as the mixture cooks to loosen and
  incorporate the brown particles stuck to the bottom of the pan.
      Cook about 15 minutes.
      Add tomato puree and tomatoes.  Stir to blend and cook together
  for about 3 minutes.
      Pour in the reserved broth and bring to a boil. Add thyme, bay
  leaf, oregano, red pepper, basil and black pepper. Cook over low heat
  for 1 hour.
      Add rice, cover and cook for 15 minutes.
      Add reserved shrimp, oysters, and crab and cook 5 minutes more.
      Stir in the green onions.  Taste for salt.

           -cayenne pepper to taste
           -salt to taste
      2 lb Shrimp - peeled
     12    Green onions - sliced
    1/2 c  Parsley - minced
 
  To make a really good pot of jambalaya, you're going to need a
  well-seasoned black cast iron Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid.
  And for this recipe, an 8-quart pot is perfect!
  
  So take the pot, put it on the burner over high heat, and pour in the
  bacon drippings (or margarine).  Then toss in the smoked sausage,
  andouille, tasso, and crumbled bacon and stir-fry the meats until the
  smoked sausage turns light brown (it should take about 8 minutes or
  so).
  
  Now, drop in the julienned chicken and stir-fry it until every strip
  loses its translucency (turns white). Then immediately add the
  onions, bell pepper, celery and garlic, and reduce the heat to
  medium-high, and cook the vegetables until they soften.
  
  At this point, pour in the rice.  And you want to stir it thoroughly
  into the seasoning vegetables and meats until every single grain is
  moistened -- about 4 to 5 minutes.
  
  Next, add the tomatoes, beef stock, Kitchen Bouquet, thyme and chili
  powder, blend everything together well, and bring the mixture to a
  slow boil.  When this happens, taste the liquids and season the dish
  to taste with salt, black and cayenne pepper.  Just remember that
  you're going to have to season it a little on the "heavy side"
  because the rice will absorb much of the seasonings as it cooks, and
  you still have a couple pounds of shrimp to mix in.  *So be sure to
  taste carefully!* [I'd definitely add Tabasco for flavor, too.]
  
  When everything is just right, reduce the heat as low as it will go,
  put the lid on the pot, and simmer the jambalaya for about an hour.
  This "slow cooking" process allows each grain of rice to cook evenly,
  puff properly, and pick up the combination of flavors.  If the heat
  is too high, the rice will stick to the bottom of the pot and turn
  mushy.
  
  Then when the jambalaya is done, about 5 minutes before you're ready
  to eat, stir in the raw shrimp, green onions, and parsley, put the
  lid back on the pot, and continue to simmer the jambalaya over *low
  heat* until the shrimp turn pink.
  
  I suggest that before you serve the dish, you fluff the rice
  slightly. I also suggest that you serve the dish alongside crispy
  butter French bread and ice-cold beer.
  
  CHEF'S HINTS: 1. Under no circumstances should you remove the cover
  from the pot during the slow-cooking process. If you do, you'll
  release steam you need to cook the rice. Your rice will turn out hard
  in the center and your jambalaya will be dry instead of moist. Don't
  peek in the pot! 2. If you don't feel that your stove-top will cook
  the jambalaya slowly enough, put the cover on the pot (after you mix
  the liquids in), set your oven at 300F, put the pot into the oven,
  and bake the dish for about 45 minutes. It will come out perfect!

      Title: JAMBALAYA~ LOW CAL
 Categories: Rice, Low-cal
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Onion - chopped
    1/4 c  Green pepper - chopped
    1/2 c  Tomato - chopped
      2    Clove garlic - minced
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 ts Thyme
      2 ts Parsley - fresh, minced
    1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
           -Pinch cayenne
      1 c  Chicken stock - made without
           -salt or fat
    1/2 c  Rice - uncooked
      2 oz Chicken - lean, cubed,
           -cooked or raw
 
  Heat a saucepan and add the onion and bell pepper. Using a wooden
  spoon, stir them over medium heat until they begin to color while you
  scrape the sides and bottom of the pan to be sure that nothing sticks
  and burns. Add the tomato, garlic, herbs and seasonings and stir
  together. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Add the rice and chicken
  and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes, then
  uncover and let the Jambalaya dry out a bit. Fluff up the Jambalaya
  with a fork and serve.
  
  NOTES: Different rices will vary this dish. Experiment. It is not
  necessary that each grain be separate. Jambalaya, by the nature of
  its cooking process, may be somewhat sticky and perhaps the better
  dish for it.
  
  VARIATION: Jambalaya can be made with shrimp, lean turkey sausage,
  smoked chicken or smoked turkey.  Just remember to keep it light.

      Title: JAMES BEARD'S CHEESE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 tb Granulated sugar
  1 3/4 c  Warm (100-115 deg) water
      5    To 6 cups all purpose flour
      1 tb Salt, or to taste
    1/4 c  Butter, softened
      1 ts Tabasco
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese, freshly
           -grated
    3/4 c  Gruyere or Emmenthaler
           -cheese, shredded
 
     Dissolve the yeast with the sugar in 1/4 cup of the warm water and
  allow to proof. In a large bowl, mix 5 cups of flour and the salt.
  Make a well in the center and add the remaining 1 1/2 cups warm
  water, the butter, the Tabasco, and the yeast mixture. Stir with a
  wooden spoon or spatula or with your floured hands until the dough is
  well amalgamated. Turn out on a heavily floured board (use 1/2 cup
  flour) and knead for 10 to 12 minutes or until the dough is smooth,
  elastic, and rather satiny in texture and all the flour on the board
  is absorbed; add flour if you need it. Place the dough in a buttered
  or oiled bowl and turn to coat on all sides. Cover with a towel and
  let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, 1-1/2 to 2
  hours or slightly more.
     Punch down the dough, turn it out on a lightly floured board, and
  knead in the cheeses. When thouroughly blended, cut the dough in half
  and let rest for 10 minutes, then roll out each half into a rectangle
  about 11 X 6 inches and let rest for 2 or 3 minutes more. Roll each
  triangle up, pinching the edges as you do so, and tucking in the ends
  so that the loaf measures about 4-1/2 X 7-1/2 inches. Place the dough
  in two well buttered tins, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until
  the bread has reached the top of the tin, or slightly higher, or has
  more or less doubled in size.
     Bake on the center of the middle rack of a preheated 375F deg oven
  for approximately 30 minutes, or until the loaves sound hollow when
  removed from the tins and rapped with the knuckles on both top and
  bottom. Bake directly on the oven rack, without the tins, for a few
  minutes to firm the crust. Cool the bread on racks before slicing.
  VARIATIONS:
     * Instead of the butter, use 1/3 cup peanut oil or olive oil. Also
  use oil on the baking tins.
     * Use fresh Parmesan orRomano only - a little over a cup - or use a
  mixture of the two.
     * Use sharp shredded Chedder instead of the Gruyere cheese.
     * Bake as one loaf in a 10 X 4-1/2 X 3-inch pan, which will make a
  thicker , more concentrated loaf and will take slightly longer to
  bake. SOURCE: Beard on Bread by James A. Beard Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.

  1 1/4 c  Beef broth
  1 1/4 c  Dry red wine
      6 sl Bacon, lean
    1/2 c  Dry bread crumbs
 
  Pinto beans, Great Northerns, or pea beans can be used. Pick over the
  beans, and soak them in water to cover by 2 inches overnight, changing
  water at least one time. Drain. In a kettle, combine the beans with
  water to cover by 1-inch and add one of the onions, stuck with the
  cloves, the bay leaf, 8 garlic cloves, and salt. Boil the mixture for
  5 minutes, and then simmer it, covered, for 25-30 minutes, or until
  the beans are just tender. Stud lamb shanks with slivers of garlic
  and rub them down with crumbled dried rosemary and salt to taste. In
  a heavy skillet, heat 3 Tbsp butter and 3 Tbsp oil over mod-high
  heat. Brown the lamb shanks and season them with salt and pepper. Add
  the rosemary, broth, wine, and bring liquid to a boil.  Simmer the
  shanks, covered, for 60 minutes. In another skillet, cook the
  remaining 2 onions, sliced thin, in the remaining 3 Tbsp oil, until
  they are lightly browned.  Cook them, covered, until they are
  softened and season them with salt and pepper. Drain the beans,
  reserving the cooking liquid. Put half the beans in an 8-qt.
  casserole, top them with the onions and the remaining 3 cloves of
  garlic, chopped fine. Transfer the shanks to the casserole and top
  them with the remaining beans. Pour the lamb braising liquid over all
  and add enough of the bean cooking liquid to just cover. Top the
  casserole with the bacon strips. Cook it, uncovered, in the middle of
  a preheated 350f oven for 60 minutes. Sprinkle the top of the mixture
  with bread crumbs. Dot with the remaining butter, cut into bits. Bake
  the mixture, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until the bread crumbs
  are golden. a 1970 Gourmet Mag. favorite.

      Title: JAMES BEARD'S MINCEMEAT
 Categories: Holiday, Preserves, Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 lb Beef rump or brisket
      4 lb Beef tongue
      1 lb Beef suet
      2 lb Seedless raisins
      2 lb Sultana raisins
      2 lb Currants
    3/4 lb Citron peel, diced and
    1/2 lb Orange peel, finely chopped
    1/2 lb Lemon peel, finely chopped
      1 lb Sugar
      1 pt Strawberry preserves
      1 pt Raspberry preserves
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Cinnamon
      2 ts Nutmeg
  1 1/2 ts Mace
      1 ts Allpice
    3/4 ts Ground cloves
           Sherry or cognac
 
  "Begin by assembling a goodly supply of Cognac, apple brandy, sherry,
  and if you can find it, boiled cider. If not, settle for more apple
  brandy or applejack and more Cognac. You can also use up any odd
  liquers or that bottle you were given last Crhistams and have kept
  hidden on a shelf. All these things will help to make your mincemeat
  better."
  
  Boil the rump and tongue seperately in salted water until tender. Let
  the rump cool until it can be handled, remove the excess fat, and
  chop coarsely or put through the coarse blad of a meat grinder. Let
  the tongue cool, remove the skin, and chop or grind coarsely. Chop
  the beef suet very finely and combine it in a crock with the meats.
  Add raisins, sultanas, currants, citron, peels and mix well.  Add
  sugar and jams and salt. Mix spices together and mix into the mixture
  in the crock. Mix ingredients well with the hands and then cover the
  mixture with Sherry, Cognac, etc. -- enough to a make a rather loose
  mixture. Cover tightly and let rest for 2 weeks. Uncover and taste,
  and add more spirits if necessary. Let rest for another 2 weeks
  before using.
  
  At this point, if you wish to store the mincemeat in smaller
  containers, transfer it to sterilized jars or crocks, add more
  liquor, and seal or cover them tightly. The mincemeat will keep more
  or less indefinitely in a cool place or in the refrigerator.
  
  When using for pies,  Add 1 to 1 1/2 cups chopped fresh tart apple to
  each 2 1/2 to 3 cups mincemeat, bake at 450 F. for 10 minutes, reduce
  heat to 350 F. and continue baking until crust is well browned.

  NOTE: Wrap in foil after cooling if you wish to keep them. They will
  keep nicely from 1 to 2 weeks.
  
  Persimmons grow in many countries of the world, but often, as in
  France, they are left hanging on the trees. In this country (USA) we
  have learned to appreciate their superb deep-orange color, their
  shape, and their delicate flavor, and they are becoming increasingly
  popular. In earlier times they were allowed to ripen on the trees
  until dead ripe before being eaten raw or used for puddings, cookies,
  and breads. Nowadays they show up in our markets in a firm state and
  must be left at room temperature for several days or a week to ripen
  until they are almost mushy.
  
  This old recipe, sent to me by a dear friend from the Middle West,
  makes a bread that is almost cakelike in texture. Spread with good
  fresh butter, it is very pleasant to eat along with a cup of tea or
  to use for a cream-cheese Sandwich. It is unusual, rich, and
  thoroughly delicious.
  
  *Traditionally this bread is baked in four 1-pound buttered and
  floured coffee cans, but you can use 3- to 4-cup charlotte molds (my
  preference, (JB) round Pyrex dishes, or round stainless steel bowls.

      Title: JAMES BEARD'S SALT RISING BREAD (EE)
 Categories: Bread salt
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
           Salt-rising bread starter:
  1 1/2 c  Hot water
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Warm water
           - (100 to 115 degrees)
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Lukewarm whole milk
           - (90 to 110 degrees)
      2 tb Butter, melted
      1 ts Salt
  5 1/2 c  Flour
 
  Recipe by: ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW #EE2134  Make starter: In a glass
  bowl mix together all ingredients for starter. Cover with a plate and
  place in a barely warm oven for 12 hours, or until top is covered
  with 1/2 to 1-inch of foam (a gas oven with pilot light is warm
  enough or heat electric oven to 250 degrees for 20 minutes; turn off
  before placing bowl in oven.) Keep warm.
  
  Make bread: Strain liquid from salt starter through a sieve set over a
  large mixing bowl. Pour 1/2 cup warm water over potato, pressing to
  extract as much liquid as possible; discard potato. Stir baking soda,
  milk, butter and salt into potato liquid. Add 2 cups of flour and
  beat until very smooth. Add 2 1/2 cups more flour, stirring until
  dough comes together. Sprinkle remaining flour over work surface,
  turn out dough and knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until dough is smooth.
  Divide in two and form into loaves. Place loaves in 2 well-buttered
  loaf pans, cover and set aside in a warm place to double, 4 to 5
  hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until
  bottom of loaves sound hollow when tapped. Turn loaves out of pans
  and cool completely on racks before slicing.

      Title: JAMES BEARD'S SOURDOUGH RYE
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 pk Active dry yeast
  3 1/4 c  Warm water (100-115 deg)
      6 c  All-purpose flour (approx)
      2 c  Rye flour
      2 ts Salt
      1 tb Caraway seeds
  1 1/2 ts Poppy seeds
      2 tb Melted butter
      3 tb Granulated sugar
           Cornmeal
      1    Egg, lightly beaten in
      1 tb Water
 
  Four days ahead of breadmaking, prepare the "starter". Combine 1
  package of the yeast, 2 cups warm water, and 2 cups all-purpose flour
  in a plastic bowl or container. Cover tightly and let stand for 2
  days at room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least another day
  (see note below).
  
   The day before preparing the dough, combine 1 cup of starter, the rye
  flour, and 1 cup warm water in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let
  stand overnight at room temperature. The next day stir down the dough
  and add the second package of yeast, dissolved in 1/4 cup warm water,
  salt, caraway seeds, poppy seeds, butter, and sugar.
   Then add up to 4 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup at a time, to make a
  stiff but workable dough.  Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, then shape
  into a ball. Place in a buttered bowl, turning to coat the dough with
  the butter. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until
  doubled in bulk, about two hours.
  
   Punch down and divide the dough in half. Shape into two round loaves
  and place on buttered baking sheets generously sprinkled with
  cornmeal.
  
   Cover and let rise again until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Brush
  with the egg wash, and bake in a preheated 375 deg F. oven for 30
  minutes, or until lightly browned and the loaves sound hollow when
  rapped with the knuckles. Cool, covered with towels to prevent the
  crust from hardening.
  
  NOTE: This will provide more starter than you need for this recipe.
  To keep it going, replenish with equal parts of warm water and flour,
  let stand again at room temperature, then refrigerate. Continue the
  process each time you use some of it.

     Cut up the bacon into little -inch pieces and fry slowly in the
  bottom of a large pot while you... Peel the onion and stab the cloves
  into it (15-30 cloves).
     Put the onion into the pot and let it warm with the bacon while
  you... Cut up the cabbage into roughly bite-sized chunks - somewhat
  thicker slices than for slaw.
     Put the cabbage in the pot and add enough water to about
  half-cover the cabbage; then turn the heat up high. But don't go away!
     Quarter, core and peel the apples. Toss them in on top of the
  cabbage with a small handful (about a 1/2 teaspoon) of salt. Sprinkle
  the lemon juice over it all.
     By this time the water should be boiling. Turn down the heat and
  put a lid on the pot.
     Go away and let it cook for 10 minutes. Stir 'n sniff. Cover and
  let it cook another 10 minutes.
     Now you can serve it "as is", or you can ladle out part of the
  liquid, thicken it with cornstarch or arrow-root, and stir it back in.

      Title: JANE BRODY'S HIGH-CALCIUM CABBAGE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Finely shredded red cabbage
    1/2 c  Finely shredded green cabbag
      1 ts Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Plain non/low-fat yogurt
    1/4 c  Orange juice concentrate *
    1/4 c  Canola oil
    1/4 c  Powdered nonfat milk
      1    Egg
      1 c  Whole-wheat flour
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Toasted sesame seeds
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
    1/8 ts Mace
    1/8 ts Ground ginger
 
  * 1/4 cup orange juice and 1 tablespoon sugar can replace concentrate.
  
  The author says this can be made with 1 cup of only one type of
  cabbage but for the sake of color would choose red cabbage.
  
  1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
  
  2. Place the cabbage in a small bowl and toss it with lemon juice.
  
  3. In large measuring cup or medium bowl, combine the yogurt, orange
     juice concentrate, oil, powdered milk and egg, blending the
     ingredients well.  Stir in the cabbage.
  
  4. In large bowl, combine the flours, sesame seeds, baking powder,
  baking
     soda, salt, mace and ginger, mixing them well.
  
  5. Gradually add the cabbage mixture to the flour mixture and mix the
     ingredients until they are just combined.  Pour the batter into a
     greased 8x4 inch loaf pan.
  
  6. Place the pan in hot oven and bake for 35-45 minutes or until a
  tester
     inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. Turn the
  bread
     out onto a rack to cool completely before slicing.
  
  This is a great bread to serve with a soup or salad meal. After the
  first day, it is wonderful toasted. Try it, too, as a sandwich bread.

      Title: JANE BURBANK'S HUSHPUPPIES (FLORIDA COOKING)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Self-rising corn meal-
           -(preferably white stone-
           -ground)
    1/2 c  Self-rising flour
    1/4 c  Pancake mix (see note)
           Pinch salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      1 ea Egg
      1 md Onion, diced
    1/2 c  Milk, or as needed
           Oil or fish drippings for-
           -frying
 
  Hushpuppies are fried in hot drippings left after frying fish,
  picking up some of the fresh fish flavor.
  
  Combine the corn meal, flour, pancake mix, salt, sugar, and pepper in
  a bowl.  Beat the egg lightly in a measuring cup, and add the onion
  and enough milk to fill to the 1-cup mark. Mix the liquids into the
  dry mixture well.  If not moist throughout, add a tablespoonfull or
  two more of milk, blending well.
  
  Put any fish drippings you may have in a heavy frying pan and add
  enough oil to a depth of 1/4 inch.  Heat and drop a small amount of
  batter into the fat.  If it sizzles, the fat is hot enough. Make a
  test hushpuppy: Drop a teaspoonful of batter in; if it spreads like a
  pancake, the batter is too thin, so stir a tablespoonful or two of
  corn meal into the uncooked batter. If, after the test hushpuppy has
  cooked, it is dense and dry, stir 2 or 3 teasponns of milk into the
  batter. When the batter consistency is right, drop the batter from
  the tip of a teaspoon into the pan; cook 6, 8, or 10 at a time, being
  careful not to let the hushpuppies overlap while frying. Cook until
  lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes, turn, and brown the other side,
  about 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and keep hot while frying the
  remaining hushpuppies. Add more oil to the pan as needed, a little at
  a time, to prevent cooking.  Fat should be kept medium-hot, to brown
  hushpuppies.  Check often so that hushpuppies do not scorch.
  
  NOTE:  In Florida many like to use self-rising flour and corn meal as
  well as pancake mix in hushpuppies and other breads. If you wish,
  substitute all-purpose flour for self-rising and the pancake mix; use
  plain corn meal in place of the self-rising type.  Then to the dry
  ingredients add 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Add
  the liquid ingredients, then proceed with the recipe as directed.

      Title: JANE GRIGSON'S TOMATO TART
 Categories: Italian, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This recipe is based on one from the Piedmont region of Italy. It is a
  traditional Italian marriage of basil with tomatoes. The eminent food
  writer Jane Grigson had a fine contempt for too much concern about
  cholesterol, so Raw Materials has substituted olive oil and less of
  it for the butter in the original recipe. If you share her feelings,
  go for the butter.
  
  Slice 1 kg of tomatoes into half-centimetre rounds. Season them with a
  little salt and pepper and a pinch of sugar and set aside.
  
  Roll out puff pastry (using frozen is fine++life is too short to make
  puff pastry and there is now a brand made with polyunsaturated oil)
  to line a 25 to 28 cm tart tin with a removable base.
  
  Dip the tomato slices in cornmeal coating them on both sides, and fry
  them slowly in a little olive oil until golden brown. Layer the
  slices into the pastry case. Sprinkle the top with chopped basil,
  then with 2 tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese.  Sprinkle with a
  few drops of oil.
  
  Bake in a preheated 230C oven for 15 minutes,then lower the heat to
  190C and cook for a further 20 minutes or so. Serve straight from the
  oven before the tomato juices can make the pastry soggy.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

 Categories: Abm, Rolls
      Yield: 12 Rolls
 
      4 c  All Purpose Flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Shortening
      8 tb Dry milk powder
      1 md Egg--slightly beaten
    1/2 c  Sugar
     12 oz Water
  2 1/2 ts Yeast--active dry *
 
  Add to the breadmachine in order preferred by your machine. (In mine,
  start with the flour and add dry ingredients first). Yeast should be
  placed in the yeast dispenser. **note! If you use Fleishmans yeast,
  increase the amount by 1 teaspoonful!
  
  Run this on your dough cycle. After completion they can be finished
  one of several ways. One is to take a pinch of dough about the size
  of a small egg, pull, dip in melted butter, run through
  sugar/cinnamon mixture and then tie them in a knot.
  
  Another method is to roll out to about the size of a cookie sheet,
  spread butter (slightly LESS than a stick) over surface, then top with
  sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll and slice about 1/2 inch thickness. You
  should get enough for about 3 9" round or sq. pans. I cover the
  bottom of pans lightly with melted butter--just a small amt! Allow
  room for them to double in size!
  
  Place in a proofing oven (turn on oven set to 250 for 2 mins then
  TURN OFF and place rolls in off oven). Let rise till very light and
  double in bulk (will take about 1 1/2 hrs). Can cover with greased
  waxed paper. (Do not use towels as they stick!!) Bake in preheated
  oven at 375 degrees for about 20 mins. Remove from pan at once.
  
  Can be frozen. Best when eaten warm! Recipe will work as a caramel
  roll OR even just a plain sweet dinner-like roll. DO NOT use too much
  butter as they will not rise enough!

  souffl or baking dish with the remaining half tablespoon of butter.
  Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels. Arrange a
  layer of potatoes on the bottom of the dish and then alternate layers
  of onions and anchovies ending with potatoes. Sprinkle each layer
  with a little white pepper. Scatter bread crumbs over the top layer
  of potatoes and dot the casserole with the 2 tablespoons of butter
  cut into bits. In a small saucepan, heat the milk and cream until it
  barely simmers, then pour over potatoes. Bake in the center of the
  oven for 45 minutes or until the potatoes are tender when pierced

  souffl or baking dish with the remaining half tablespoon of butter.
  Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels. Arrange a
  layer of potatoes on the bottom of the dish and then alternate layers
  of onions and anchovies ending with potatoes. Sprinkle each layer
  with a little white pepper. Scatter bread crumbs over the top layer
  of potatoes and dot the casserole with the 2 tablespoons of butter
  cut into bits. In a small saucepan, heat the milk and cream until it
  barely simmers, then pour over potatoes.
  
  Bake in the center of the oven for 45 minutes or until the potatoes
  are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer and
  the liquid is nearly absorbed.
  
  .\\ichele's notes: I hate anchovies. With a passion. But this is one
  of the best dishes I ever had. The cream and milk leech the salty
  anchovy taste right out and it turns into what can only be described
  as heaven. A definite Swedish Christmas staple at our house!

 Categories: Japanese, Condiment
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 oz Salad Oil

  Pour the oil and tamari into a blender and blend until well mixed.
  Add the cashews and pulse briefly, to chop them coarsely. Serve. If
  this is too salty, back off on the tamari. This can be adjusted
  infinitely to individual taste. Tamari is one kind of Japanese Soy
  Sauce. It comes in reasonable sized bottles, but is somewhat more
  expensive than other Soy Sauces due to the method it is manufactured.

           Kkikkoman soy sauce
           Chili sesame oil, which is
           - very very hot
 
  Chop cabbage fine, place in colander and pour boiling water over the
  cabbage. Cool to touch, then squeeze cabbage well to get the water
  out. In a bowl mix cabbage, chopped green onions, chopped mushrooms
  and grated ginger. Mix ground beef, wine, soy sauce, sesame oil and
  black pepper together with vegetables; mix well. Place a small amount
  of filling (about 1 teaspoon) in center of gyoza wrapping and fold in
  half. Pleat edge to seal. If edges won't stick together, dampen the
  inside edge with a little water, then pleat. Put 2 tablespoon salad
  oil in heated skillet (on medium heat). Place gyozas in skillet,
  close together and fry until golden brown. Then, at edge of pan, pour
  in a little water, up to 1/4 of the depth of the pot-stickers. Cover,
  turn heat to low and simmer until water is gone. Serve with dipping
  sauce as appetizer, or with hot rice as entree.
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ no way Jos!
  SAUCE:Mix soy sauce with chili sesame oil. Use a proportion of 10
  parts soy sauce to 1 part oil; if you use a 5 to 1 proportion it may
  be a little hot for most people. The authentic sauce is a 2 to 1
  proportion.

  Sylvia's comments: I converted this from a marinate-and-broil recipe
  that required better meat. This worked great on cheap stew lamb; it
  actually took away the strong lamb taste. I defatted the crockpot
  juices, thickened with cornstarch, and used it on green beans. That
  with the lamb and some yellow rice made a great dinner.

      Title: JAPANESE LUNCH NOODLES
 Categories: Noodles, Entree
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8    Dried black mushrooms
           -(shiitakes)
      6 c  Hot water or stock
      1    Sweet potato (12oz)
           Peeled, cut in 1/2" dice
      1    Leek, trimmed, washed,
           And thinly sliced
      1    Zucchini, cut widthwise
           Into 1/4" slices
      4 c  Stemmed kale leaves, cut
           Crosswise into 1/2" strips
      6 tb Miso (pref hatcho-miso)
           Or to taste
      6 tb Mirin or
           A little less cream sherry
      2 tb (to 3 tbs) fresh udon or
      8 oz Dried udon or other pasta
      6 oz (to 8 oz) very thinly sliced
           Beef or chicken breast
      1 bn Scallions, trimmed
           Thinly sliced
 
  Soak the mushrooms in 1 cup hot water or stock in a bowl until soft,
  about 20 min. Stem the mushrooms and cut each cap in quarters,
  reserving the soaking liquid. Bring 4 qts of water to a boil in a
  large saucepan. Place the mushroom soaking liquid and remaining stock
  in another large saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the sweet potato
  and leek and simmer for 3 min. Add the zucchini, mushrooms, and kale
  and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 2 min. Remove the pan
  from the heat and stir in the miso, mirin, and honey or sugar. Stir
  until all the miso is dissolved. Correct the seasoning, adding miso
  or honey or sugar to taste; the broth should be highly seasoned. The
  recipe can be prepared ahead to this stage. If preparing ahead, don't
  boil the water for the noodles. Just before serving, cook the noodles
  in the boiling water until tender but not soft, about 3 min for fresh
  noodles, 8 min for dried. Drain the noodles in a colander. Stir them
  into the broth with the beef or chicken and sliced scallions. Cook
  the noodles until thoroughly heated, but do not let the broth boil;
  you'll destroy some of the nutrients in the miso. Serve at once.
  
  Note: Original recipe called for 10 oz tofu (pref extra-firm or firm
  silken), cut widthwise into  1/4-inch slices. 6 to 8 oz thinly sliced
  beef or chicken breast is a suggested substitute, but the recipe
  doesn't say whether or not this should be cooked first.

      Title: JAPANESE ROSY PICKLED GINGER (GARI)
 Categories: Low, Fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Unpeeled baby ginger (in
           Oriental groceries) or
           Peeled regular ginger
           (Note: regular ginger tends
           To be stronger and tougher,
           But works
           Quite well anyway)
           Peel (if necessary), rinse,
           And pat dry.
           Put in a bowl and coat with
           About a heaping tablespoon
           Salt
           (preferably the pickling
           Variety)
           -
           (24 hours later:)
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 c  Rice vinegar (unseasoned
           Light)
      1 c  Less 2 tablespoons water
           Set in a cool place for 24
           Hours
 
  Dissolve sugar in rice vinegar and water.  Put into a 6-cup resealable
  glass jar (I use the kind with the lever-action wire closure and
  rubber seal ring). Rinse the salt off the ginger and pat dry. Put
  ginger into vinegar/sugar solution.  Close jar and refrigerate at
  least a week.
  
  The vinegar will turn the ginger a rosy pink.  Just before serving,
  slice thinly with the grain.
  
  You can keep a jar of this going indefinitely by replenishing the
  ginger and vinegar/sugar solution as it is used.

      Title: JAPANESE SALAD
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Carrot, cut into thin
           Julienned strips
    1/2    Green pepper, also cut into
           Thin julienned strips
        x  Some mung bean sprouts- I
           Used about 2 C. or so.
 
  Boil water.  Throw in carrot and let cook for a minute or two. Add
  pepper and sprouts.  Turn off heat when water reboils. (I let it sit
  a few minutes at this step and it was fine, still crispy). Drain the
  vegies and rinse with cold water.  Chill.
  
  Before eating toss with dressing:
  
  ~ 1 T. soy sauce - 2 T. rice wine vinegar - 1 t. sesame oil - sesame
  seeds (for looks mostly)
  
  I found I still had most of the dressing left in the bottom of the
  dish, so not all of the sesame oil was consumed.
  
  Source: This is modified from a recipe I found in the Orlando Sentinel
  while on vacati on.
  
  This makes enough for 2 side dishes or 1 large meal (for me). YMMV.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Koromo ( batter )
      1    Egg beaten
      1 c  "cold" water
      2 tb Dry white wine
      1 c  Flour
           Tentsuyu(dipping sauce)
      1 tb Dashi no moto( fish stock)
      1 c  Water
      2 tb Mirin( sweet rice wine )
           Or 1 tbs sugar
      2 tb Sake ( or dry white wine )
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
           Ginger root to taste
           Vegetables & fish: EX:
           Carrots, onions, mushrooms
           Peppers, zucchini, snow pea,
           Squash, eggplant etc. etc.
           "okra "
           Shrimps, crab, scallops,
           Squid, cod. etc. etc.
 
  Before you begin here a few essential tips to remember: you'll need a
  deep thick wall pan ( wok o.k.  ), filled with 1 inch of peanut oil
  preferred ( Never lard or shortening ),slice vegetables thin enough
  for even cooking, fry in small batches and never crowd, and have the
  temperature of the oil from 340 for vegetables or 360 degrees for
  fish. Cold water in batter is a must to keep the flour from being
  sticky.Do a trial try of frying so you'll know how long vegetables or
  fish need to cook.Author did not mention poultry but I surmise it
  would be cooked as the fish is.Vegetables and fish were the initial
  things cooked this way in the history of tempura due to their trade
  with the Portuguese and Dutch merchants.
  
  Make the batter: Beat egg with water. Mix in flour and whisk quickly.
  Set aside. Make the tempura dip: Boil the dashi no moto ( this is a
  dried soup stock from fish or poultry usually contained in tea bag
  type of packing )in the water for 2 or 3 minutes. Turn off the heat
  and add all the remaining ingredients. Prepare the vegetables or fish
  but cutting into rings, strips, cubes etc.For fish, dredge in flour
  before dipping in batter. Vegetables are just dipped into the batter.
  Let excess batter drip off with either fish or vegetables.( meanwhile
  you will have had the oil preheated in the pan to the right
  temperature for either fish or vegetables Drop into oil by hand or
  use a tbs for vegetable cubes. Take the vegetables or fish out of the
  oil when slightly browned. Serve the tempura with the Tentsuyu dip
  along with rice.Place rice in a bowl, top with tempura and a few tbs.
  of the tentsuyu dip. Or serve tempura over Japanese noodles ( soba ).
  Note all Japanese ingredients may be found readily in most
  supermarkets or gourmet grocers today.  Also, there are other
  variations in frying tempura; this is one basic historic method.
  Prior to using peanut oil, seseme seed oil was used mainly when
  tempura first became popular in Japan, over 400 years ago.

      Title: JAR CAKES
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
    Ever baked cakes in canning jars? It's neat! ANY quick bread-type
  cake can be baked in canning jars.
  
    I usually bake one jar first -- you have to know how high the batter
  rises. I usually fill ONE jar 1/2 full then bake it to see how high it
  rises, then go from there. You don't want the cake to come out of the
  top of the jar, only to within 1/4 to 1/2 inch from the lip of the
  jar. Write it down on your recipe (how far you filled the jars)! Once
  you've established how high the cake rises, you can go from there.
  The first time around is a bit tricky because you won't know how many
  jars you'll need. MOST of the recipes I've tried I end up using
  around 8. Sterilize as many jars as you think you'll need and go from
  there. Make sure your LIDS are new, the rings don't have to be As the
  jars do seal, the cakes are as moist as the day you put them into the
  jars--sometimes MORESO.
  
    The baking times will vary -- the moistness of each cake recipe will
  determine the time. MOST of the recipes I've tried bake in 35-40
  minutes. Start checking the cakes at 25- 30 minutes and go from there.
  
    YES, the cakes DO slide easily out of the jars IF you use the jars
  I've listed. They're Ball 12-oz Quilted Crystal Canning Jars
  (#14400-81400). They can be found at most grocery stores (at least
  here in California) next to the pectin and other canning supplies.
  Also, I've seen the 12 oz straight-sided (plain) jars (# ?) at Smart
  & Final. The plain jars work fine too but they're not as pretty and
  you have to make your own labels--the jars I use come with decorative
  labels. One IMPORTANT tip--get your jars NOW! Once summer's over with
  they're very hard to find. Also, when you can, ask for the jars back,
  they're NOT cheap. Most folks don't mind returning them though, they
  usually want refills! <G>
  
    There will be a little condensation on the lids and some in the
  jars so when you seal them it's trapped inside. Don't worry about
  getting the water off of the lids before placing them onto the jars,
  the added moisture doesn't hurt the cakes in the slightest. Quick
  bread-type cakes work best, I've found that lighter cakes tend to
  fall when the jars seal.
  
    I'm trying to address every question that's been asked of me
  before, I HOPE I've done that. If I've missed anything or if anyone
  has any questions, don't hesitate to ask. These make WONDERFUL
  Christmas gifts and you cn start NOW! Single friends really
  appreciate these because each jar makes enough for one or two people.
  I'll post the recipes I've made in my next notes. Try them, they're
  FUN and delicious to boot! Be right back with a few more tips...
  
    Several folks have asked me how long the cakes can be safely
  stored...I'm not sure. The longest I've been able to keep them
  (without getting eaten) is 6 months. The jars DO seal, just like any
  canned good. You don't have to refrigerate the jars, just keep them
  in a COOL, dark, dry place. I've only had 6 jars go bad on me and
  that was my fault...put them in a cupboard that got too hot and the
  seals broke. I now check the jars at least once a week by pushing
  down on the lid (in the middle); if the lid moves up and down, that
  means the seal has broken. If you've checked the jars frequently,
  more than likely they're safe to eat; otherwise, toss the cake. I've
  been making cakes in canning jars for over 3 years and haven't
  poisoned anyone so far. :)  If you give the jars away, be sure to
  tell the person to check the jar periodically (if they plan on
  storing it for any length of time).
  
    Not only are the cakes tasty, they're very pretty to decorate. A
  hot glue gun is INVALUABLE! You cn glue on dried flowers, ribbons,
  dough-art ...you name it, it can be glued onto the lid, ring and side
  of the jar. I usually cut out a piece of cloth (about 3 inches larger
  in circumference than the lid), using pinking shears (so the cloth
  doesn't unravel), place a wad of cotton or batting in the center of
  the lid (take the ring off -- the jar lid should be sealed by now),
  then place the piece of cloth on top and replace the ring. Decorate
  to your heart's desire!
  
    There are probably a few more tips I've forgotten...if anyone has
  any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Don't limit yourself to the
  recipes I've given you...ANY quick-bread type cake cn be baked in
  canning jars. Lighter cakes tend to fall once the jar seals.
  
  Be right back with the first recipe...

  approximately 3 minutes. Drain on absorbent paper. Fry remaining
  rolls. Serve hot with soy or chilli sauce for dipping. Note: Choose
  flat fillets of firm white fish. They should be thin, for they have
  to be rolled around the prawns.

      Title: JASPER'S BREAD & BUTTER PUDDING WITH CRANBE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Day-old baguette
      1 c  Fresh or frozen cranberries
      6 tb Unsalted butter, melted
      3 c  Milk
      6    Whole eggs
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
           Custard Sauce (recipe
           -follows) or whipped cream
 
  Jasper's Bread and Butter Pudding with Cranberries
  
  Cut bread into three-inch sections.  Square off sections by removing
  crust. Slice each section lengthwise into 2 rectangular pieces no
  more than 1/2 inch thick.
  
  Scatter 2/3 c cranberries over bottom of lightly greased 7x11 inch
  baking dish. Brush both sides of bread pieces with melted butter and
  place over cranberries in neat rows.  Arrange pieces to overlap
  slightly, giving shingled effect.
  
  Whisk milk, eggs, sugar and vanilla vigorously until smooth. Gently
  pour mixture over bread and cranberries. Let stand 30 minutes,
  occasionally pushing down on bread to absorb as much liquid as
  possible.
  
  Sprinkle remaining cranberries over top and bake at 325 degrees 30
  minutes or until edges are set and wood pick inserted in center comes
  out clean. If pudding top is not brown, remove pudding from oven and
  place nder broiler to brown slightly. Watch carefully to prevent
  scorching.
  
  Let stand 15 minutes.  Cut into squares, using rows of bread as a
  guide. Serve with custard sauce or whipped cream. Makes 6 to 8
  servings.
  
  Custard Sauce:
  
  1/2 vanilla bean 2 c milk 4 egg yolks 3/4 c sugar Split vanilla bean
  lengthwise and scrape seeds into heavy saucepan. Add bean pod and
  milk. Heat to just below boiling, then remove from heat. Cover and
  let steep 20 minutes.  Scrape bean again and add any scrapings to
  pot. Discard bean pod.
  
  Whisk together egg yolks and sugar and add warm milk gradually,
  stirring often, until all milk is added. Return to pot and cook over

      Title: JAT JUK (CREAM OF PINE NUT PORRIDGE)
 Categories: Soups, Korean
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
      1 c  Water
      4    Dried jujubes (korean dates)
           -soaked in water 2 hours
      2 ts Honey
    1/4 c  Rice flour; dissolved in 1/2
           -cup water; left 5 minutes
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
 
  "The porridge, it is not quite a soup, is usually served on three
  different occasions. The first is for breakfast as a special treat,
  since pine nuts are expensive everywhere. The second is as a restorer
  of strength for persons who are ill or debilitated. The third
  occasion is as a snack anytime of day when special friends meet --
  not the tea or coffee hour but pine-nut soup time."
  
  1. Grind the pine nuts in a processor with 1/2 cup water for about 1/2
  minute. Add the balance of the water and process the mixture until
  smooth. Pour through a metal strainer and rub the particles through,
  preferably with a wooden spoon. Discard the small amount of residue,
  which is mostly the "eyes" or buds of the pine nuts.
  
  2. When the jujubes are ready, cut out and discard the pits. Cut the
  jujubes into thin slices and mix with the honey. Set aside.
  
  3. Simmer the rice flour paste in a pan over low heat, stirring
  constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture just starts to
  bubble. This is the soup thickener.
  
  4. Add the pine nut mixture, the sugar and salt to the rice flour and
  bring to a low boil for 2 minutes. The lightly thickened porridge,
  smooth and creamy, is now ready.
  
  Pour it into individual bowls and garnish with a teaspoon of the
  jujube and honey.
  
  Serve warm.

      1 c  Sour cream
      2 c  Corn flake crumbs
 
  Cook onion in 1/2 the butter until onions are soft. Add salt, pepper,
  soup, and sour cream.  Stir till mixed. Pour mixture over the hash
  browns which have been placed in a greased 9x13 casserole dish. Melt
  the remaining butter and mix with the corn flake crumbs and top the
  casserole. Bake at 350 F for 35-40 minutes.
  
  Note:  I use 1/2 of the butter listed and usually use margarine. Also
  it is better to take a kitchen form and stir the mixture into the
  hash browns to sort of coat all of them.

  some of its oil. (If pan is hot enough, you should not have a problem
  with sticking.) Add diced onion and stir to brown for about 3
  minutes, adding garlic at end.
  
  Add green beans, potatoes and water (enough to just cover the
  vegetables) then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender,
  which may take 35 to 45 minutes, depending on size of potatoes.
  Season with pepper and salt to taste (the turkey wing usually adds
  enough salt).
  
  Serves 6.

           -chopped into bits,
           -about 1 cup
 
  Preheat the oven to 350F. Combine the flour, 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup
  softened butter in the medium bowl of an electric mixer. On low
  speed, beat the mixture until mixed. On medium speed, beat the
  mixture until smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Pat the mixture evenly over the
  bottom of an ungreased 9 X 13 X 2 inch baking dish. Spread the pecans
  evenly over this mixture. Combine the 2/3 cup butter with the

      Title: JEANETTE'S STRAWBERRY JELLO MOLD
 Categories: Bananas, Nuts, Salads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  :          Jeanette's Strawberry Jello
  :          Mold -- see below
  
  Soften 1 envelope plain gelatine in 1/4 cup water. Dissolve it and 2
  packages (3 oz) strawberry jello in 2 cups boiling water. ADD: 1
  large or 2 small packages frozen strawberries 1 small can crushed
  strawberries 1-2 diced bananas 1 cup fine chopped nuts
  (optional-daughter disliked them so I left them out.) FILLING: 1 cup
  sour cream(will use LandoLakes nofat) 1 package Dream Whip made up
  Combine well. METHOD: Pour half of jello mix into mold and chill to
  allow to become fairly firm. Spread filling over jello and pour over
  that the rest of the jello. Allow to become very firm before
  unmolding- like overnight. (I have to confess that we were usually
  too impatient, and it was a pretty amusing dish, adding a little more
  hilarity to some occasions than I thought absolutely necessary when I
  attempted to unmold it.  Well it WAS pretty funny to see pieces of it
  it sliding around the platter! But Jeanette's was always gorgeous, so
  it can be done.  However, since we'll be having some
  non-family-members at the table this year,  I'm considering serving
  it from the bowl. On the other hand, why mess with tradition?)

      Title: JEANNE VOLTZS' GRANDMOTHER'S POTATO SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb New potatoes
           -(red skins are great)
      2    Hard boiled eggs
      1 ts Dijon mustard
      2 tb Balsamic or cider vinegar
           -(I prefer the balsamic)
      3 tb Olive oil (for this
           -recipe I prefer a
           -Greek oil)
      2    Large scallions, finely
           -chopped, including green
           -parts
      2    Ribs celery, diced
    1/2 c  Home made mayonnaise
      1 ts Celery seed
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
 
  Scrub potatoes and place in a saucepan with water enough to just cover
  them. Cover the pan, bring to a boil, and boil until potatoes are
  barely tender, about 15 - 20 minutes. Remove potatoes and let cool
  until comfortable to handle, then peel them, cube them and place in a
  large bowl. In a small bowl stir the mustard and vinegar together and
  then beat in the olive oil.  Pour the mixture over the potatoes and
  gently toss and coat well. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours. After
  potatoes have cooled add the scallions, celery, mayonnaise, celery
  seed and salt and pepper to taste. Again toss gently but thoroughly.
  Turn into a serving bowl lined with lettuce if you like, slice the
  eggs and arrange in a circle around the outside of the salad. Cover
  and refrigerate or serve at once. SOME SUGGESTIONS:  When I have BBQ
  I usually eat the salad as the recipe states, or with a little
  Hungarian paprika sprinkled over the top.

      Title: JEFF'S FAVORITE BARBECUE BRISKET
 Categories: Bar-b-q, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 lb Beef brisket
           Smoker for cooking
     10 lb Charcoal
    1/4 lb Mesquite wood
           Basting sauce
           Barbecue sauce
 
  This is a perfect way to spend a day, and makes a meal fit for a king!
  
  It really takes a smoker to make this successfully, but creative
  folks can use whatever's handy.
  
  Select a good quality beef brisket.  Trim off excess fat and store in
  refrigerator until ready to barbecue.
  
  If you wish, marinade the meat for additional flavor or tenderness. A
  good marinade can consist of water, Worcestershire Sauce, Soy Sauce,
  pepper, lime or lemon juice - whatever you like! (No Salt, though)
  
  Start 8 lbs. of the charcoal and allow coals to develop gray ash over
  all before beginning to cook. Reserve the remaining 2 lbs. for adding
  when needed later. Add wood that has been soaking in water for an
  hour or so.
  
  Cook the meat on a grate approx. 8 inches over the coals, adding
  charcoal and wood to fire as needed.  It isn't necessary to keep a
  heavy smoke at all times, just 1/2 of the cooking time. Use a meat
  thermometer to determine doneness of meat to your preference.  If the
  smoker has an indicator for temperature, a low heat is fine. Coals
  and wood tend to burn at lower temperatures when enclosed in a smoker.
  
    While cooking, it is essential to baste often with the basting
  sauce. Usually every 10 minutes or even less will ensure a juicy and
  delicious brisket.
  
    If basting with another sauce, remember that anything containing
  sugar or tomato will burn, leaving a scorched flavor. That's
  especially true with meats cooked over long periods of time.
  
    Serve with the warmed barbecue sauce and breads, beans, salad or
  potatoes.
  
  Enjoy!    Jeff Duke

      Title: JEFF'S FAVORITE PIZZA SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Italian, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     28 oz Canned Progresso Plum
           Tomatoes w/Basil, drained
     12 oz Tomato paste
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
      1 ts Onion powder
      1 tb Oregano, heaping
      1 ts Garlic powder
      2 tb Parmesan cheese
    1/8 c  Olive oil
 
  This sauce has a quality similar to restaurant flavor, but being
  freshly made seems to take on a better flavor.
  
    Puree the drained tomatoes well.  It is important to use Italian
  Plum Tomatoes, not regular canned tomatoes. The flavor is
  distinctively different.  If you cannot find Progresso Plum Tomatoes
  with basil, add 1/2 ts. dried basil to the tomatoes.
  
    Place the puree mixture in heavy saucepan.  Add remaining
  ingredients except for the grated cheese. Simmer 1/2 hour, or longer
  if necessary.
  
  Add cheese last 10 minutes of cooking. The canned grated parmesan is
  good in this recipe, as well as fresh.
  
    Sauce can be frozen if needed.

     56 oz (2-28 oz cans) Italian Plum
           Tomatoes, drained
      6 oz Tomato paste (small can)
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Corn syrup
      2 tb Brown sugar
  2 1/2 tb Oregano
      1 tb Tarragon
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Garlic powder
      1 tb Basil
    1/2 ts Onion powder
    1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
 
  If you don't like small bits of tomato in the sauce, puree the whole
  tomatoes in the blender first. Otherwise, chop them as the mixture
  cooks.
  
  Mix all ingredients, except oregano, in large saucepan. Simmer for 30
  minutes, then add oregano. Cook additional 15 minutes.
  
  Sauce is best if cooked then chilled, overnight, in the refrigerator.
  
  To Use:  Prepare basic pizza dough.  Spoon sauce onto crust out to
  rims, cover with thick layer of mozzarella cheese. Top with meat and
  vegetable toppings, then cover again with mozzarella and parmesan (or
  romano) cheeses. All cheeses are best if freshly grated.

      Title: JELLIES
 Categories: Condiments, Desserts, Jams
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Select and wash fruits.  Remove stems, hulls, and blossom ends. Cut
  hard fruit in quarters.  Do not pare or remove seeds.
  
  Extraction of Juice Soft Fruit: Use just enough water to prevent
  fruit from sticking.  Heat gradually, stirring constantly. Crush
  fruit and cook until it has lost its color. Hard Fruit: Cook, with
  sufficient water to cover, until fruit is soft. Do not crush if a
  clear jelly is desired.
  
  Straining the Juice:  Pour cooked fruit into a wet flannel jelly bag.
  Allow juice to drip into a large container. Do not squeeze fruit if a
  clear jelly is desired. When juice has stopped dripping return pulp
  to preserving kettle.  Add sufficient water to cover. Cook slowly,
  stirring constantly, for thirty minutes. Again strain juice, but keep
  this second extraction separate from the first as the first
  extraction makes the clearest jelly. A third extraction may be made
  from some fruits, depending upon the pectin content.
  
  Test for Pectin:  Combine 1 tablespoon cooked fruit juice, 1 teaspoon
  sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon Epsom salts. Stir until salts dissolve. Allow
  to stand about 20 minutes. If juice contains sufficient pectin to
  make jelly, the mixture will form into a gelatinous mass or large
  flaky particles. If fruit juice shows only a small amount of pectin,
  use an equal volume of apple juice, which is rich in pectin, and a
  satisfactory jelly will be obtained.
  
  Sugar Content of Jelly:  Too large a proportion of sugar will result
  in a gummy jelly which can not be molded. Too small a proportion of
  sugar will result in a tough, dark jelly with an inferior flavor.
  Currants, unripe grapes, and green gooseberries are about the only
  fruits which require an equal measure of sugar. Two-thirds as much
  sugar as fruit juice is the usual rule.
  
  Cooking the Jelly:  Work with a small quantity of juice, not more
  than two quarts at a time. Measure juice, heat rapidly to boiling.
  Add sugar, stir until it is dissolved. Boil rapidly until a jelly
  test is obtained. The sugar may be heated before adding to boiling
  juice if desired.
  
  The Jelly Test: Dip a spoon into the boiling liquid. Pour juice from
  spoon. If it sheets and two drops hang together from the side of the
  spoon, the jelly is done and must be removed from the fire
  immediately. Skim.
  
  Sealing and Storing:  Pour the jelly immediately into freshly
  sterilized glasses.  Cover at once with a thin layer of melted
  paraffin. Roll the glasses to insure the entire surface being well
  covered. Cool. Cover with a second layer of melted paraffin. Label.
  Store in a cool place.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2 c  Cake flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 pk (3 ounces) jello
    3/4 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Oil
      2 tb Lemon extract
      4    Eggs separted
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman Jello Flavored Cake In one
  mixing bowl sift 1-1/4 cups of the sugar, flour, baking powder and
  gelatin together. In another bowl, combine milk, oil and lemon
  extract.
  
  Beat the liquids into the dry ingredients until batter is smooth.
  Beat egg yolks in one at a time into the batter. Whip egg whites
  until stiff but not dry with 1/4 cup of sugar. Fold the egg whites
  lightly but thoroughly into the batter.
  
  Grease ring pan with vegetable shortening and dust with flour. Spoon
  batter into pan and bake at 325 F. 40 to 50 minutes until cake
  springs to the touch. Turn out immediately onto a wire rack.
  
  Decorate with a thin icing and trim with what ever you want.
  
  Note: I used strawberry jello and extract and decorated after
  drizzling icing on top with fresh strawberries cut in half. I also
  have used orange jello. Decorate with candied orange slices. I also
  found that 40 minutes was too long to bake this cake in my oven.

      1 pk Cool whip, thawed (8 oz)
 
  Bake cake mix as directed on package.  Remove from pans to cool.
  Rewash pans and put cakes back in them when the cakes are completely
  cooled. It is best to use 2 8-9" round cake pans but you can use an
  oblong pan if you want.  After cakes have been place back into pans
  (top side up), prick them with utility fork at 1/2" intervals.
  Meanwhile, dissolve each flavor separately in 1 cup boiling water.
  Carefully pour one flavor gelatin over each cake layer (if using
  oblong pan you must use the same flavors for the 2 pks).
   Chill 3-4 hours.  Dip one cake pan in warm water for 10 sseconds,
  then unmold cake layer onto serving plate. Top with about 1 c. cool
  whip. Unmold second cake layer and carefully place on first layer.
  Frost with remaining topping.  Chill.  Great moist'n fruity cake
  especially for those who like a light, refreshing cake that is not
  too sweet.

      1    (12 oz) can frozen grape
           -juice concentrate, thawed
      3    Envelopes unflavored gelatin
  1 1/2 c  (1 can) water
 
  From: Vicki Lansky's CANDY book
  
  GRAPE FINGER JELLO
  
  Soften gelatin in grape juice. Boil the water, add the juice/ gelatin
  mixture and stir til gelatin dissolves. Remove from heat, pour into a
  lightly greased 9x13 pan and chill. Cut into squares when firm.
  Refrigerate in a covered container. This is good lunch box and
  traveling fare. It can go unrefrigerated up to 4 hours under normal
  (not desert!) conditions.
  
  Variation: substitute frozen cranberry juice cocktail concentrate for
  grape juice. Or a 12 oz can frozen apple, pear, apple, juice
  concentrate.
  
  SLIPPERY CIRCLES
  
  Let any of the recipes for finger jello stand and chill til thickened
  which doesn't take very long (15 to 25 minutes). Place a spoonful of
  the gelatin into each of 4 empty and clean 6 oz cans, such as usually
  used for frozen orange juice. Cut a peeled banana in half and center
  it in the can. Spoon in remaining gelatin. Chill till firm. To
  unmold, dip to rim in warm water and let it slide out. Or remove
  bottom of can if more appropriate. Cut into slices.
  
  SUNSHINE SQUARES
  
  (A Finger Jello that is good even for breakfast).
  
  4 envelopes unflavored gelatin 3/4 cup pineapple juice 1 cup boiling
  water 1/4 cup sugar 1 cup orange juice
  
  Soften gelatin in pineapple juice. Add to boiling water and stir til
  dissolved. Add sweetener and orange juice. Chill in a 9x9 inch pan,
  then cut into squares. Refrigerate in a covered container. Variation:
  If you wish to use honey instead of sugar, decrease the orange juice
  by 1/8 of a cup.
  
  APPLE RING SNACKS
  
  Why pay for Weight Watchers Apple Snack when you can make your own?
  
  Peel an apple and remove the core. Slice in rings. Place on alightly
  greased cookie sheet, or on clear plastic wrap laid out on a cookie
  sheet. Dry in an electric oven at low or warm temperatures, In a gas
  oven the pilot light is sufficient. Drying takes 6-9 hours, making
  this a good overnight project. The size of the apple slices and your
  oven temperature are the variables you will have to experiment with.
  The apples need not be dried to a crisp. Store in an airtight
  container. These should last several weeks at room temperature. Good
  for traveling!

      Title: JELLY-FILLED PEARS IN PUFF PASTRY WITH CARAME
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
  1 1/3 c  Sugar
      7 tb Water
      1 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb Calvados or other apple
           -brandy

MMMMM---------------------------PEARS--------------------------------
      4    Small Bartlett pears (about
           -5 oz ea), peeled
      4 ts Red currant jelly
      1 pk (17 1/4 oz) frozen puff
           -pastry (2 sheets), thawed
      1    Egg yolk, beaten to blend
           -(glaze)
           Vanilla ice cream (opt)
 
  FOR SAUCE: Stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium
  heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring
  until syrup turns deep-amber color, occasionally swirling pan and
  brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush to dissolve any
  sugar crystals. Remove from heat. Carefully stir in cream (mixture
  will bubble vigorously). Cool. Stir in Calvados.  (Can be made 1 day
  ahead. Cover and chill).
  
  FOR PEARS:  Cut off top 1 1/2 inches from stem end of pears and
  reserve. Core each pear through the top, leaving bottom intact. Spoon
  1 teaspoon jelly into hole in each pear. Replace stem end.
  
  On work surface, roll out each pastry sheet to  18x15 inch rectangle.
  Cut out four 8 inch rounds and four 2 inch rounds. Reserve scraps.
  Place pear in center of each 8 inch pastry round. Gather pastry
  around each pear and pinch pastry to hold in place (stem end will be
  exposed). Brush pastry with egg glaze.  Make hole in center of each
  two inch pastry round. Fit 1 round over stem of each pear to form
  top. Press firmly against pastry bottom to seal. Brush pastry top
  with egg glaze. Cut out 4 small leaves from pastry scraps. Brush with
  egg glaze and place 1 leaf just below stem of each pear. Refrigerate
  at least one hour and up to
        2    hours.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F.  Butter baking sheet.  Place pears on prepared
  sheet and bake until pastry is golden brown, about 25 minutes.
  
  Rewarm caramel sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently. Spoon
  sauce onto 4 plates.  Place hot pear in center of each plate. Serve

      Title: JELLYFISH DAIKON & CHICKEN BREASTY SALAD
 Categories: Chinese, Fish
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried, salted whole
           -jellyfish
      1    1-pound daikon radish
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 lg Chicken breast
    1/2    Egg white
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Dry sherry
      3 tb Peanut oil
      2 tb Sesame oil
      3    Scallions, chopped
 
  Here's a classic Chinese "texture" dish, a cold salad made of with
  dried jellyfish.  I know jellyfish sounds bizarre, but, after
  soaking, the jellyfish has a texture similar to woodears-crunchy and
  crisp with little taste of its own.  I consider the addition of the
  chicken to be a sop to those who like to see recognizable things in
  their food...
  
  Actually, this would probably be quite good with just the chicken or
  just the jellyfish.  It has a light dressing made of mixed oils and
  wine. Very nice on a hot summers day. More than likely, you'll have
  to go to a Chinese market to get the jellyfish.  This is another
  recipe from my huge pile of clippings.  It's from the SF Chronicle,
  but I don't know the date.
  
  Soak the jellyfish in a large bowl of cold water for 24 hours,
  changing the water a couple of times.  Peel the daikon with a
  vegetable peeler; slice thinly; stack slices and cut into matchstick
  shreds. Put into a mixing bowl, toss with the 2 teaspoons of salt and
  let stand 1 hour.
  
  Meanwhile, drain water from jellyfish.  Pour boiling water over the
  jellyfish and let stand for 15 seconds. Drain and run under cold
  water. Set aside.
  
  Bone the chicken breast and slice thinly; cut slices into shreds. Mix
  chicken with the egg white, cornstarch and teaspoon of sesame oil;
  refrigerate for
       30    minutes.
  
  While the chicken is marinating, cut jellyfish into the thinnest
  possible shreds by rolling up each sheet and slicing it thinly. Place
  in a large bowl.  Wring most of the moisture from the daikon shreds;
  add to the bowl with the jellyfish.  Heat 3 cups water in a saucepan.
  When boiling, turn off the heat and add the chicken shreds, stirring
  to separate the pieces. Simmer for 1 minute.  Drain and rinse under
  cold water. Drain and add to the bowl with the jellyfish.
  
  Blend the salt and sugar with the wine until they dissolve. Heat the
  oils in a saucepan and add the seasoned wine. It will sputter and
  evaporate. When the oil is hot++don't let it smoke++turn off the heat
  and add the scallions.  Cool.  Toss with the salad just before
  serving.

      Title: JENNIE GROSSINGER'S KNISHES
 Categories: Desserts, Vegetables, Jewish
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Sifted flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Eggs
    2/3 c  Salad oil
      2 tb Water
           Sift the flour, baking
           -powder and salt into a
           -bowl. Make a
           Well in the center and drop
           -the eggs, oil and water
           -into
           It. Work into the flour
           -mixture with the hand and
           -knead
           Until smooth.
           There are two ways to fill
           -the knishes. In either
           -case,
           Divide the dough in two and
           -roll as thin as possible.
           Brush with oil. Now you can
           -spread the filling on one
           -side
           Of the dough and roll it up,
           -like a jelly roll.  Cut
           -into
  5 1/2    Inch slices.
 
  Here's the basics, fillings follow in the next messages.
  
  DOUGH:
  
  Place in an oiled baking sheet cut side down.  Press down lightly to
  flatten. Or you can cut the rolled dough in 3- inch circles. Place a
  tablespoon of the filling on each; draw the edges together and pinch
  firmly.  Place on an oiled baking sheet, pinched edges up
  
  In either case, bake in a 375 degree oven 35 minutes or until browned.
  Makes about 24.
  
  FILLINGS FOR KNISHES
  
  POTATO: 1 cup chopped onions 6 tablespoons chicken fat or butter 2
  cups mashed potatoes 1 egg 1 teaspoon salt
      1/4    teaspoon pepper
  
  Brown the onions in the fat or butter. Beat in the potatoes, egg,
  salt and pepper until fluffy.
  
  CHEESE 1 1/2 cups diced scallions or onions 4 tablespoons butter 2
  cups pot cheese 1 egg 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/8 teaspoon pepper 2
  tablespoons sour cream
  
  Scallions are better than onions for this, so try to get them. Brown
  the scallions in the butter and beat in the cheese, egg, salt, pepper
  and sour cream until smooth.
  
  MEAT: 1/2 cup minced onions 2 tablespoons chicken fat 1 1/2 cups
  ground cooked meat 1/2 cup cooked rice 1 egg 1 teaspoon salt 1/4
  teaspoon pepper
  
  Lightly brown the onions in the fat. Add the meat, rice, egg, salt and
  pepper, mixing until smooth.
  
  CHICKEN 1 1/2 cups ground cooked chicken 3/4 cup mashed potatoes 1
  egg, 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper
  
  Mix all the ingredients until smooth.
  
  And finally, the classic:
  
  POTATO-DOUGH KNISHES
  
  1/4 cup minced onions 6 tablespoons chicken fat or butter 4 cups
  mashed potatoes 1/2 cup potato flour 3 eggs 1 teaspoon salt 1/4
  teaspoon pepper
  
  Brown the onions in 4 tablespoons chicken fat or butter. Cool.
  
  Knead together the remaining fat or butter, the pota- toes, potato
  flour, eggs, salt and pepper. Break off pieces (about 2 inches long)
  and flatten slightly. Place a tea- spoon of browned onions on each
  and cover by pinching the edges together. Place on a greased baking
  sheet. Bake in a 375 degree oven 25 minutes. Makes about 20.

           Jerk Seasoning:*
      1 tb Dried minced onion
  1 1/2 ts Onion powder
      2 ts Crushed thyme
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground allspice
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
           Black beans -- rinsed and
           Pineapple chunks -- drained
 
  Rub whole tenderloin with Jerk Seasoning.  Prepare a covered grill for
  indirect cooking (or preheat oven to 450 degrees for conventional
  cooking): Bank medium-hot coals (thickly covered with white ash) to
  one side of grill and place meat on opposite side.  Place whole
  tenderloin in grill in covered grill and cook 15 to 20 minutes or
  until meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 160
  degrees. To cook in a conventional oven at 450 degrees, place roast
  in an open pan and cook about 20 minutes or until internal
  temperature reads 155 degrees on a meat thermometer. Allow roast to
  stand 10 minutes before cutting.  In a large bowl toss together
  beans, onion, chili powder and cumin. Heat a large skillet over
  medium-high heat, film with a little oil and stir-fry the bean
  mixture until heated through, about 3-4 minutes.  Toss bean mixture
  with chopped fresh coriander, lime juice, and salt. Serve sliced
  tenderloin with beans, warmed tortillas and salsa. Makes 4 servings.
  ~-Pineapple-Cucumber Salsa: In a medium bowl stir together drained
  pineapple chunks, diced cucumber, rice vinegar, olive oil, cayenne
  pepper, jalapeno pepper, black pepper and fresh coriander. Cover and
  let rest at room temperature for an hour to let flavors mingle.
  Refrigerate for longer storage.  Bring to room temperature before
  serving. Makes 3 cups. ~-*Jerk Seasoning: Mix together dried minced
  onion, onion powder, crushed thyme, salt, allspice, nutmeg cinnamon,
  sugar, black pepper and cayenne. Makes enough to coat one whole
  tenderloin. I usually quadruple this recipe and use it on ribs and
  chicken before grilling. May 24,1995 Omaha World Herald

 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Beef flank steak
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Paprika
    1/4 c  Non-iodized salt
      2 ts Garlic powder
      2 ts Ground Black Pepper
      1 ts Ginger
 
  Fire up your smoker and start settling the coals in for a long slow
  smoke before starting the rub.
  
  Pat the meat dry with a paper towel and slice it, with the blade of
  the knife 30 degrees to the horizontal, across the grain, creating
  strips 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.
  
  In a small mixing bowl, blend together the sugar, salt, paprika,
  garlic powder, pepper and ginger.  Rub this mixture into the meat,
  putting the spiced strips on the grill, but don't fill the water pan.
  Give the jerky 3 to 5 hours of smoke at 130 to 180 degrees F.
  propping the lid open a crack if the temperature threatens to rise
  disastrously beyond the desired range.
  
  When the strips are chewy-crisp, remove them from the heat, let cool,
  and store individually in plastic wrap. Refrigerate to store longer
  than a few days.

  Mix all ingredients except meat to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced
  meat into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 12 to 24 hours (the longer
  the better). Smoke using mesquite chips for about three hours and
  then finish drying in oven. If doing whole operation in oven use
  liquid smoke and hang strips of meat on highest rack and put shallow
  pan underneath to catch drippings. Turn oven on and set to lowest
  possible setting and leave for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried. A
  couple of hints that I picked up from one of the cooking echos. Use
  toothpicks or wooden skewers to hang meat by, and line the pan with
  aluminum foil to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems
  later on. If you have access to sweet onions (vidalias, etc) they can
  be sliced and dried and then run through the blender to make an
  excellent onion powder to be used in this recipe.

  slicing is easier if the steak is partially frozen.) Combine all the
  ingredients and marinate in the fridge for at least 8 hrs, mixing
  occasionally. Then skewer the marinated strips on bamboo skewers or
  toothpicks and hang the strips in the oven with a pan below to catch
  the drippings. Set the oven on it's lowest setting (l00-150 F) and
  use something to keep the door ajar. The jerky should be dry after
  8-10 hours. This was my first time making j erky and the product come
  out surprizingly good, but perhaps a bit too salty. You might want to
  try low salt soy .

      1    6 oz can tomato paste
      1    2.5# can Ital tomatoes+juic
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Basil
           Several cloves sliced garlic
 
  Saute bacon and some onion in oil.  Then add beef, sausage, green
  pepper and the rest of the onion.  Cook until meat is browned. Then
  add mushrooms, tomatoes (with juice), bay leaf and seasonings. Simmer
  for 1 hour. Add tomato paste and wine and simmer for another 30
  minutes. If your sauce winds up being a little runny, add some more
  tomato paste or let simmer uncovered till desired consistency is
  achieved. I rarely make this recipe the same way twice.  It's a very
  forgiving recipe and experimentation is reccommended.  Try adding a
  dash of Worchestershire sauce and/or a dash of bitters.  Add some
  oregano, whatever you like. This recipe also doubles very easily. The
  amount of garlic was purposely vague as I'm one of those people who
  feel that you can never have enough garlic. If you're not a
  garlic-aholic, you probably will only need one clove of garlic. This
  was given to me by my father Jerry Elliott. ~-  Hunter Elliott

      Title: JERRY'S CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM
 Categories: Ice cream
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
    1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa pwdr
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      2    Large eggs
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Whipping cream
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  1.  Melt the unsweetened chocolate on top of a double boiler over
  hot, not boiling, water.  Gradually whisk in the cocoa and heat,
  stirring constantly, until smooth. (The chocolate may "seize" or
  clump together. Don't worry, the milk will dissolve it.)  Whisk in
  the milk, a little at a time, and heat until completely blended.
  Remove from the heat and let cool. 2.  Whisk the eggs in a mixing
  bowl until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the sugar, a
  little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended,
  about 1 minute more. Pour in the cream and vanilla and whisk to
  blend. 3.  Pour the chocolate mixture into the cream mixture and
  blend. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1 to 2 hours,
  depending on your refrigerator. 4. Transfer the mixture to an ice
  cream maker and freeze following the manufacturer's instructions.
  Makes 1 quart. VARIATIONS: CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE CHIP:  Add 3/4 c.
  semisweet chocolate chips after the ice cream stiffens (about 2
  minutes before it is done), then continue freezing until the ice
  cream is ready. CHOCOLATE MINT: Whisk 1 teaspoon peppermint extract
  into the mixture just before transferring it to the ice cream maker.
  CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER: Just before transferring the mixture to the
  ice cream maker, pour about 1 cup of it into a separate bowl. Add 1/2
  cup smooth peanut butter and whisk until completely blended. Return
  to the remaining mixture and blend. CHOCOLATE BANANA: Mash 2 overripe
  bananas and the juice of one lemon together in a bowl, then whisk
  until smooth. After the ice cream stiffens (about 2 minutes before it
  is done), add the banana mixture, then continue freezing until the
  ice cream is ready. CHOCOLATE FUDGE PECAN: After the ice cream
  stiffens (about 2 minutes before it is done), add 3/4 cup pecan
  halves, then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready.  After
  it is ready, remove the dasher and fold in 1 cup fudge sauce (cold)
  into the ice cream with a spatula. CHOCOLATE REESE'S CUP:  Chop 1 cup
  Reese's Peanut Butter cups, place into bowl and refrigerate.  After
  ice cream stiffens, add the candy, then continue freezing until the

  thoroughly. Add salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, and stir. Add chili
  sauce and hot green chili and stir. Simmer on low heat for 5 to 6

  down cooking time, but, the longer you let it simmer, the better the
  chili will be. Some people will tell you if you cook with beans it is
  not chili. For those people I say.....You cook chili your way and
  I'll cook mine my way (VBGrrrriiiiiiiinnnnnnnnn). If you want to add

      Title: JESSICA'S FAVORITE MUFFINS
 Categories: Digest, July, Ovo lacto
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/4 c  Oat-bran
      1 tb Baking powder
    1/4 c  Honey
      1 c  Blueberries
      2    Bananas
  1 1/4 c  Skim milk
      2    Egg whites
      2 tb Corn syrup
 
  Preheat oven to 425 F.  Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. The
  blueberries too, it keeps them from staining the ingredients. Mash the
  bananas in a separate bowl and mix the milk, egg whites, honey, and
  corn syrup together, then blend with the dry ingredients. Line muffin
  pans with paper baking cups, and fill with batter. Bake about 15
  minutes. Makes 12 muffins.
  
  ***HINTS***  I found that if you try to eat these straight from the
  oven they tend to stick to the paper. They keep great for a week
  though in the frig without sticking. If you eat 3 of these a day, it
  is suppose to be a sufficient amount of oatbran to significantly
  lower your cholesterol. So far, I haven't seen much of a difference
  in my own, but that is just me and I am still trying.  Also, if you
  use a 1/4 cup measure to scoop out the batter, it pretty much evenly
  distributes the batter amoung the 12 cups.
  
  ***Variations****  I have tried the following substitutions in many
  combinations and these are still good. raisens instead of blueberries
  or no fruit at all, 1/4 c brown sugar instead of 1/4 c honey, no
  bananas, one banana, 2 Tbsp of canola for 2 Tbsp of corn syrup
  although I wouldn't recommend this for obvious reasons. Also, you
  could try 2 cups of oatbran and 1/2 cup apple fiber.  I have not
  tried this yet, but will the next time I make muffins.  I FINALLY
  found apple fiber (no, not apple pectin) yesterday at a hfs thanks to
  my friend Jen who happens to be on this list!! Apple fiber is an even
  better fiber than oatbran, and therefore even better for lowering LDL
  and raising HDL!
  
  I hope you enjoy these!

 Categories: Jewish, Breads, Sourdough
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Water,warm (110 degree)
      1 pk Yeast, dry
    1/2 ts Sugar
      4 ts Salt
      3 c  Rye sourdough starter
           Measured after stirring down
           At room temperature.
      2 c  Flour, gluten
  3 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose or as
           Needed.
           Cornmeal (for sprinkling
           The baking sheets)
           GLAZE:
      1    Egg white beaten with 2 tbs
           Water.
           OPTIONAL TOPPING:
      2 ts Chernushka (black caraway)
           Seeds.
 
  You can buy chernushka "black caraway" in some health food stores or
  from mail-order. They are nothing like the familiar caraway seeds.
  This bread is a New York specialty, usually made in bakeries.
  
  1.  Combine 1/2 cup of the warm water, the yeast and sugar and let
  stand until doubled in bulk, about 10 minutes. 2. Dissolve the salt
  in the remaining warm water in a mixing bowl. Mix in the sourdough
  starter, then the yeast mixture, then the gluten flour and 2 cups of
  the all-purpose flour; make a soft dough. 3. Spread 1 1/2 cups flour
  on the kneading surface and turn the dough out onto it. Knead, adding
  more flour if necessary to make a soft dough that will hold its
  shape. Do not overknead.. the dough should be only slightly elastic,
  even a bit sticky. 4. Form the dough into a ball and put in an
  ungreased bowl; cover with plastic, and let rise until doubled in
  bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. 5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly flour
  surface and knead it a few strokes to expel air. Cover with a towel
  and let rest for 15 minutes. 6. Divide the dough in half. Form each
  half into a loaf by flattening in to an inch-thick oval about 12
  inches long, then rolling it up from one long side. Pinch the seam
  closed. Shape the ends of the oval loaves neatly and plce them on two
  cornmeal-dusted baking sheets, seam down. Cover with towels and let
  rise until "three-quarters proofed," or not fully doubled.

  7.  While the loaves are rising, set a large roasting pan containing 2
  inches of boiling water on the oven floor (or the lowest shelf of an
  electric oven) and preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 8. Brush the
  loaves with egg-white glaze, being careful not to let the glaze drip
  onto the pan, as it sticks and burns.  With a single-edged razor
  blade or a small, sharp knife, cut three diagonal slashes, holding
  the blade almost parallel to the surface, about 1/4 inch deep on each
  loaf. Sprinkle the loaves with "black caraway" or caraway seeds, if
  you like. 9. Bake for 30 minutes on the middle and upper shelves of
  the oven, then brush again with glaze, exchange shelf positions, and
  remove the water pan. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, or until
  there is a hollow sound when you rap the bottom of the loaf. 10. Cool
  the bread on racks.
  
  There is no historical or etymological theory for the term, "corn" in
  this bread.

  Caponata Ebraica * to peel tomatoes, drop them first into boiling
  water for about 1 minute, then in cool water and the peel will come
  off immediately. according to the author, "It's hard to believe, -for
  example, that eggplant and fiocchio (fennel), the quintessence of
  Italian cooking, were originally only used by Jews." She quotes
  Pellegrino Artusi in the cookbook _Scienza e L'Arte di Mangiar Bene_
  published in 1910 that forty year earlier (1870s) that eggplants and
  fennel rarely appeared in Florentine markets as they were considered
  to be Jewish food only. Peel and dice eggplant. Season with salt &
  pepper and set aside in colander to drain off liquid. Heat the oil in
  a large skillet; add celery, onion, peppers, garlic and carrot and
  cook, uncovered, over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, 10
  to 12 minutes. Transfer vegetables to shallow baking dish, but retain
  the oil. Add eggplant to oil in skillet and sprinkle with flour. Fry,
  stirring, over moderate heat, until lightly golden. Add to baking
  dish with vegetables. Add tomatoes, green olives, vinegar, sugar,
  basil and parlsey and place in 350F oven for 1/2 hour. Remove from
  oven; mix well, taste for seasonings and add salt and pepper if
  necessary. Add capers, stir and place in oven for a couple of minutes
  longer. Serve hot as a side dish or cold as an appetizer. SERVES: 6

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Mustard seeds

      4    Whole garlic cloves, peeled
      1    Half-inch piece fresh

      2    Dried red chiles, stemmed
      1 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Mustard oil or light olive
           -oil
      1 c  Finely chopped onion

    1/4 c  To 1/2 cup water
           Freshly cooked basmati or
           -long-grain rice
 
  This dish was popular with the Bengal Lancers regiment around the
  turn of the century. For a change of pace, try it over pasta or
  Indian basmati rice.
  
  Sprinkle shrimp with salt and turmeric. Toss well to coat; cover and
  set aside for 15 minutes.
  
  Combine mustard, cumin, garlic, ginger, chiles and lemon juice in a
  blender and puree. Set aside.
  
  Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions
  and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.
  
  Add pureed spice mixture. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 5
  minutes.
  
  Stir in tomato and cook until soft. Add shrimp, stir gently to coat
  them evenly.
  
  Pour in the water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
  
  Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until shrimp are just opaque,
  about
        5    minutes.
  
  Mound rice into heated serving plates. Spoon curry over and serve.
  
  Note: Basmati rice has a distinctive nutty flavor. It is available at
  Indian, Middle Eastern, some specialty food stores and supermarkets.

 Categories: Mexican, Tex-mex
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        1 md jicama
        1 lg carrot
        1 md zucchini
        3    chipotle peppers in adobo
  :          with liquid
        1 c  onion -- finely chopped
        4    cloves garlic -- minced
        1    bay leaf
        6    whole pepper corns
      1/2 c  white vinegar
      1/2 c  water
      1/3 c  olive oil
        2 TB cilantro -- chopped
        1 ts oregano -- rubbed
  :          salt to taste
  
  Using a knife, remove the skin from the jicama. Cut the flesh into
  half inch dice. Place in a glass or earthenware bowl. Peel the
  carrot. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and drop the carrot
  in. Let the water return to the boil and then remove the carrot and
  discard the water. When the carrot is cool enough to handle, cit it
  into half inch dice. Add to the bowl with the jicama. Scrub the
  zucchini well but do not peel it. Trim, then cut it into half inch
  dice and add it to the bowl. Drain the chipotle, reserving the
  pickling sauce (use one chili for a relatively mild marinade; three
  will be stinging hot). Cut the chilies open lengthwise and scrape out
  the seeds (if your fingers are sensitive, you may want to wear rubber
  gloves). Finely chop the chilies and place them in a separate, medium
  sized bowl. Add the onion, garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns, vinegar,
  water, olive oil, and cilantro to the chipotle in the bowl. Blend in
  the reserved chipotle sauce.  Crumble the oregano between your
  fingers into the bowl. Whisk all the ingredients together, then pour
  the marinade over the jicama mixture. Toss the vegetables with the
  marinade to coat them completely. Add salt to taste. Cover the relish
  and refrigerate for at least four hours, preferably overnight.  Serve
  as an accompaniment for grilled meats or fish. Yield is about 6 cups.

  1 1/2 c  Peeled, diced jicama
    3/4 c  Seasoned rice vinegar
  1 1/2 lb Unshelled peas; or 1 pkg.
           10 oz. frozen tiny peas,

  In a bowl, combine jicama and vinegar; let stand for at least 15
  minutes or up to 5 hours. If using fresh peas, shell them; you need 2
  cups. In a 2- to 3-quart pan, cook shelled peas in about 1 inch of
  boiling water; uncovered, stirring occasionally, just until peas are
  bright green and heated through (2 to 3 minutes). Drain, immerse in
  cold water until cool, and drain again. ( Don't cook frozen peas.)
  Mix peas and chopped mint into jicama mixture. To serve, use a
  slotted spoon to ladle salad equally onto 8 lettuce-lined plates.

 Categories: Salads/dres, Southwester
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Navel oranges
      1    Jicama -- size of an apple
      1 sm Fennel bulb -- 2" to 3"
           Diameter
           Arugula
     10    Belgian endive leaves or
           Handful fresh
           Spinach
           DRESSING
      4 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Orange juice
      2 tb Balsamic vinegar
      2 ts Raspberry vinegar --
           Optional
      1    Clove garlic -- minced
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Honey
 
  Cut off the ends of the oranges with a sharp serrated knife, then
  slice the peel from the sides. With a gentle sawing motion, cut along
  each membrane to release the orange sections into a small bowl. Set
  aside.
  
  Peel the jicama, and cut into very thin slices about 1-1/2 inches
  long. Slice the fennel into very thin strips; include the feathery
  tops. Chop the arugula.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk together the dressing ingredients until the
  honey is dissolved. Refrigerate everything until serving time.
  
  Assemble the salad on a small platter shortly before serving. First,
  put down a layer of endive or spinach (a starburst pattern looks
  nice), then a layer of jicama slices. Drizzle on some of the
  dressing, then sprinkle on the fennel and arugula. Arrange orange
  sections on top, and spoon on a little more dressing. Garnish with
  some red onion slices if desired.

 Categories: China, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Glutinous rice powder
    2/3 c  Boiling water
      2    Chinese brown slab sugar
           -(sticks)-
           -=OR=-
    1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
    1/2 c  Sweet red bean paste
    1/2 c  Sesame seeds
           Peanut oil for deep-frying
 
  PLACE THE GLUTINOUS RICE POWDER in a mixing bowl. Bring the water to
  a boil and add the sugar; stir until completely dissolved. Pour sugar
  water into the rice powder; stir until well mixed. Gather the dough
  into a ball and knead until smooth. Cut dough in half and roll each
  half into two 10-inch long rolls. Cut each roll into 10 pieces. Take
  one piece and roll into a ball. Flatten it and place a 1/2-inch round
  piece of sweet red paste into the center of dough. Fold over sides to
  enclose filling and roll into a ball. Repeat until all the balls are
  made. Wet your hands with water and roll one ball in your hands to
  moisten the ball. Dip the ball into a dish of sesame seeds until the
  entire surface is covered. Press lightly to help the seeds adhere.
  Add enough oil to a wok to a depth of 2 1/2-inches. Heat to 350F.
  Deep fry balls for 8 to 10 minutes. As they expand in the oil, take a
  pair of chopsticks and squeeze the balls to help them expand and fill
  with air. The balls should triple in size, float to the top of the
  oil and turn golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels. Makes
  about 20 balls.

  Take a large piece of salt meat and soak in cold water overnight.
  Next, place fresh water in the pot and boil salt meat on the stove
  with a small amount of salt pork for 45 minutes or longer. While that
  is boiling, prepare your vegetables.  Cut turnip in small pieces,
  peel carrots, potatoes and prepare cabbage.  Add vegetables to the
  boiling pot, beginning with turnips, then carrots, cabbage and lately
  the potatoes, allowing 15 minutes between each vegetable. Cook until
  the potatoes are done.
  
  If cooking for your own family, a cup of peas placed in a cloth and
  tied to a string may be hung in the pot to cook with your salt meat
  dinner before the vegetables are placed in. They should be soaked in
  cold water first, though.

      Title: JIM'S BUTTERMILK BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 tb Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water
    1/4    To 1/3 cup honey
      2 c  Buttermilk - room
           -temperature
      6    To 6 1/2 cups unbleached
           -flour
      2 ts Salt
      4 tb Olive oil
 
  Makes two 8-inch loaves
  
  Make a sponge by dissolving the yeast in the warm water in a large
  bowl. Mix in the honey.  Add 1 cup of buttermilk. Stir in 3 cups of
  the flour, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave it in a warm
  place for 15-20 minutes until it swells and bubbles on the top.
  
  Meanwhile dissolve the salt and add the olive oil, in the remaining
  buttermilk.  When the sponge is ready add this to it along with all
  but 1/2 cup of the remaining flour. Mix well until it becomes hard to
  stir, then turn out on a floured working surface and knead, adding
  more flour as necessary until the dough is smooth and resilient -
  about 8-10 minutes.
  
  Clean out the bowl, oil or butter it, and return the dough, turning
  to coat with grease.  Cover with plastic and leave to rise until
  double in bulk, about
       15    minutes or so.
  
  Turn the dough out, punch down, then form into two loaves. Place in
  greased bread pans, cover lightly with plastic, and let rise again,
  about 15 minutes. Bake in a preheated 425 F oven 10 minutes, then
  lower the heat to 350 F and continue to bake 30 minutes. Cool on
  racks.

      3 tb Mustard seed, bruised
      1 sl Ginger, 2", peeled & chopped
      4    Garlic cloves, halved
      1 tb Black Peppercorns, bruised
      1 tb Turmeric
      1 tb Dry mustard
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3 tb Flour
      4 tb Water
 
  A traditional English mustard pickle, Piccalilli is made from a
  variety of vegetables which are first soaked in brine, then pickled
  in vinegar. The finished pickle is yellow in colour owing to the
  presence of turmeric and mustard.  The pickle may be served
  immediately it has cooled, but it improves with keeping and may be
  stored for up to 3 months. Piccalilli is usually served with cold
  meats.  Use firm red tomatoes if green ones are unavailable. About
        3    pounds.
  
  Place the cauliflower, cucumber, pearl onions, Spanish onion and
  tomatoes in a large bowl.  Sprinkle with salt over the vegetables and
  set them aside for 4 hours.
  
  Drain the vegetables in a colander and discard the liquid.
  
  In a large saucepan, bring the vinegar to a boil over high heat. Add
  the vegetables and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer
  the vegetables for 15 minutes or until they are almost tender when
  pierced with the point of a sharp knife.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and drain the vegetables in a colander.
  Discard the vinegar.  Place the vegetables in a large bowl. Sauce: To
  make the sauce, pour the vinegar into a medium sized pan and stir in
  the mustard seeds, ginger, garlic, peppercorns, turmeric, mustard and
  sugar. Place the pan over low heat and stir to dissolve the sugar.
  When the sugar has dissolved, increase the heat to moderate and bring
  to a boil, stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer
  the mixture for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and strain
  the liquid into a medium sized bowl.  Discard the flavourings left in
  the strainer.
  
  Rinse the pan and return the strained mixture to it. Stir in the flour
  mixed with the water and place over moderate heat. Bring the sauce to
  a boil, stirring constantly, and boil for 2 minutes.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and pour sauce over the vegetables. Mix

      Title: JIM'S TERIYAKI MARINADE & BBQ SAUCE
 Categories: Bbq, Japanese, Sauces, Marinades, Jw
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      1 c  Soy Sauce
      1 c  Water
      2 tb Vinegar
      2 tb Brown Sugar
      1 ts Dry Mustard
    1/2 ts Powdered Ginger
    1/2 ts Garlic Powder
      1 ts Hot Pepper Sauce, opt'l
      2 tb Corn Starch
 
  Whisk together all the ingredients except the corn starch. Marinade
  the meat long enough to flavor and tenderize- 1 hr for young chicken
  breasts or fish, overnight for round steak and up to 5 days for some
  game cuts.
  
  BBQ and baste with the marinade. Make a slurry of the starch and a
  little water and whisk into the marinade. Bring to a boil, stirring
  as the sauce thickens. Serve with the BBQ'd meat.
  
  Real garlic and ginger only improves this dish. The amount of pepper
  sauce can be varied from mild to fiery. You can substitute wine,
  sherry, orange or pineapple juice for some or all of the water to
  vary the flavor. Pineapple juice has an enzyme that provides
  additional tenderizing power to the vinegar and mustard.

      Title: JIM'S YORKSHIRE PUDDING
 Categories: English, Jw, Beef, Breads, Puddings
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 3/4 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Milk; at room temp.
      4    Eggs; at room temp.
      1 c  Water; at room temp.
           Beef drippings or melted
           -Suet for the pan.
 
  Many Yorkshire pudding recipes in American cook books call for butter
  and all milk/no water; that's a Pop-over or something not a real
  Yorkshire Pud. This pudding needs no butter or fat in the batter as
  there is plenty of beef fat in the pan for flavor. The ingredients
  are so simple that the final product is a real surprise to first time
  cooks 'cause it's SO GOOD! It used to be the custom in England to
  cook the pudding in a tray under the roast and catch all the
  drippings. You get a tastier result from making small puddings in
  muffin trays in a hot oven after the roast is out as they puff up
  more and brown nicely.
  
  In olden days it was served before the roast which would be served
  with gravy covered potatoes AND bread to stretch out the meat.
  Today's diet conscious hosts would usually serve the puddings with
  the roast instead of potatoes and bread.
  
  N.B. The ingredients must be at room temp when mixed to maximize the
  puffing effect.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 F
  
  In a bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Make a well in the
  centre and pour in the milk. Stir. In another bowl beat the eggs
  until fluffy and then add the water. Beat this mixture into the
  batter until large bubbles form. [Let stand up to an hour if you need
  to finish the roast.]
  
  Heat the muffin tins in the oven. Pour beef drippings or melted suet
  into each muffin hole to a depth of 1/4". It should be hot enough to
  sizzle but not smoke. Pour in the batter about 5/8" to 3/4" deep.
  Bake at 400 F for about 20 minutes; reduce heat to 350 F and bake
  another 10 to 15 minutes. Serve at once with the roast, gravy, and
  hot mustard or horseradish.

  and drain juice from pan. Sprinkle all the Monterey jack cheese
  evenly over the top of the meatloaf and return to oven for 15 to 20
  minutes or until the cheese starts to bubble. Watch carefully so
  cheese doesn't burn. The meatloaf will have shrunk enough so that the
  cheese melted over all sides gives a frosted effect.

  "I'll never live this down;' teased grandmotherly Jo Stallard as she
  was crowned with a tiara of fresh garlic and draped in garlic
  wreaths. A vegetarian, Jo has turned her cooking talents to adapting
  recipes for meatless cooking. This delicious soup has always been a
  winner with her friends, she says, and so it was, too, with the 1980
  Great Garlic Cook-off celebrity judges.
  
  Generously butter inside of 3-quart baking dish. Combine all

  Meatloaf - Fourth Prize Preheat oven to 350F. Mush first 14
  ingredients together by hand until well mixed and put into a bread
  pan. Stick knife in three places so meatloaf cooks evenly. Bake for
  30 minutes. Increase heat to 400F for 20 minutes. Remove from oven
  and drain juice from pan. Sprinkle all the Monterey jack cheese
  evenly over the top of the meatloaf and return to oven for 15 to 20
  minutes or until the cheese starts to bubble. Watch carefully so
  cheese doesn't burn. The meatloaf will have shrunk enough so that the
  cheese melted over all sides gives a frosted effect.

      Title: JOAN'S CONFETTI YELLOW RICE
 Categories: Grains, Ethnic
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Yellow bell pepper diced
      1    Red bell pepper diced
      1    Green  bell pepper diced
      1    Onion diced
      2 c  Raw rice- long grain
      4 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Fresh frozen green peas
           Annatto oil*
 
  Saute onions and peppers till soft but not browned. Stir in raw rice
  and cook a few minutes. Add the stock and annatto oil and bring to a
  boil. Cover and simmer until rice is tender. Let rest off heat 5
  minutes. Fluff with fork. Season to taste. Stir in thawed green peas.
  Flavorful, colorful and delicious.
  
  Annatto oil*  annatto seeds are achiote seeds. The seeds are simmered
  in oil to extract the orange yellow color used in many Hispanic
  dishes. The colored oil may color grains, pastries , vegetables or
  even add a golden yellow color as a poultry baste. to make oil: Bring
  1 cup oil ( I use olive ) with 1/2 cup annatto seeds to almost a
  boil. Simmer 5 minutes. Strain oil and cool and refrigerate. Use
  about 1 to 2 tsp in rice dishes. Annatto tends to be bitter, so use
  sparingly. In small amounts no bitter taste is noticed. Of course
  turmeric and curry do color and flavor but you may like to try this
  for a pleasant change. Note: annatto really stains, so be careful not
  to spill it !

      Title: JOCELYN'S CHOCOLATE FUDGE BARS (FUDGE MINT CO
 Categories: Bars, Chocolate, Mint
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Stick Butter
      2 oz Unsweetened Baking Chocolate
           Squares
      1 c  Sugar
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking Soda
    1/2 ts Vanilla Or Peppermint
           Extract
      1 c  Chocolate Chips
           Glaze------
      1 c  Powdered Sugar
      1 tb Milk -- or more
    1/2 ts Peppermint Extract
 
  Melt the butter and the unsweetened chocolate. (You can put them in a
  stainless steel bowl and stick it in the oven while it's preheating. )
  
  When the bowl is cool, add the sugar, beat in the eggs, mix in the
  flour, the salt, and the baking soda. Add the vanilla. Spread into a
  greased jellyroll pan (that is, 11x17). It won't be trivial; you'll
  have to use a knife or something to spread it smoothly into all four
  corners.
  
  Sprinkle with the chocolate chips, and bake at 350 F for 8 minutes or
  so. ("Bake until done.  " When they're done, they pull away from the
  pan just a little bit and have a dull glossy look to them.  )
  
  Glaze: Mix up the ingredients. It should be like a glaze that will
  pour, thickly. Add a couple of drops of food coloring if desired.
  When the cookies come out of the oven, spread the glaze. Cool
  slightly, and cut while still warm. (If you wait too long, the glaze
  will crack when you try to cut the cookies.  )
  
  Notes: You can skip the glaze, if you like. (For example, you might
  not want peppermint cookies, or you might want to use those miniature
  baking M&M's.  ) If you don't glaze them but still want peppermint
  chocolate cookies, use the peppermint instead of the vanilla. (Or in
  addition to it, for a slightly different flavor but still good. )
  
  This is Mom's recipe. It was quick and easy enough that she could
  make up a batch of cookies while getting breakfast on the table, when
  one of us four kids piped up and said "By the way, it's my turn to
  bring cookies today. "
  
  She also has an anecdote about one of our schoolkids being allergic to
  oranges, so she made a batch with orange food coloring so he could
  have something orange anyway. You could try the same trick for
  Halloween cookies...
  
  If you don't want them to be thin bar cookies, then use a smaller pan
  (9x13 or 9x9) and bake them longer.
  
  Okay, here's the "horror story" part. I got the recipe from my mom the
  other day, and decided to make them up (sans mint & glaze) that
  night. I'd been reorganizing the kitchen lately, and had a bunch of
  plastic canisters for all of my staples, but hadn't labeled
  everything yet. I thought I had the flour.  Well, it certainly wasn't
  sugar, and I knew it wasn't the Krusteaz Deluxe Basic Cookie Mix, so
  it had to be the flour, so I used it. There was something a little
  odd about it - but I've got unbleached flour, whole wheat flour,
  graham flour, and cake flour, so I figured it had to be one of the
  odd ones.
  
  It wasn't.  There was something grainy and a bit of an odd flavor to
  the cookies.  Can you say "Masa Harina"? I'd used corn instead of
  wheat flour!
  
  My next door neighbor Selene, and my SO's daughter Maria, and her
  little friend Devin like them, but nobody else will eat them.
  
  I tried the recipe again tonight.  I made the plain batch, no mint or
  mint glaze, and used mini-M&M's instead of the chocolate chips. I've
  tried them - they're perfect in every way - and if I just imagine
  them with peppermint, they're exactly as I remember them.
  
  A final footnote: I am quite serious about working to spread them all
  the way to the corners.  It'll be a thick batter, so just keep at it;
  it'll make a thin layer. That's a good thing, because it means they
  cook fast, so don't give up.
  
  [P.  S. At least that's how they turn out (thick and hard to spread
  into the corners) when I make them, using the mixer. Your mileage may
  vary, especially if you're using margarine.

  the meat's flavoring).  Strain the broth through a very fine mesh, or
  several layers of cheesecloth. Correct the seasoning, and serve with
  noodles or dumplings.
  
  Optional:  The soup may be boiled down after straining, and clarified

 Categories: Barbeque, Hamburgers, Beef
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground Round
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
      3 tb Cajun Power Garlic Sauce
      1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
    1/2 ts Black Pepper
      4 tb Italian Bread Crumbs
      1 ts Old Bay Seasoning
      1 cn Mushrooms
      4 tb BUTTER
    1/2 ts Onion Powder
 
  Saute mushrooms in 1/2 stick of butter. Mix ground beef with spices
  thoroughly. Fashion into thin patties (1/4"); 5 inches in diameter as
  they will shrink and get "thicker" after grilling. Grill until
  desired doneness. Garnish with mushrooms, tomatoes, SHARP cheddar
  cheese and lettuce. Serve on an Onion roll. Purple onion slices are
  optional for those who enjoy that sweet onion. Hamburgers tend to get
  a little boring but this will change your mind about the traditional
  burger. NOTE: This is not a "HOT" burger, so stay with the spices. It
  is a little extra trouble with all the ingredients but it is relished
  by my family. Hope yours enjoy it too. Joey Aguzin in New Awlins.

      Title: JOGGIN INA JUG
 Categories: Beverages, Health
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Apple juice
      1 c  Grape juice
      1    Or 2 Tbs apple cider vinegar
           -(some use 1 until they get
           -used to the vinegar taste)
 
  Some folks also add a cup of cranberry juice to the above. Keep
  pouring the portions in a quart or gallon jug. Seems to last forever.
  The "Joggin' In a Jug" mixture has a higher vinegar taste than the
  above recipe. This is an old folk's remedy that comes out of Vermont.
  A man named Dr. Jarvis (if memory serves me correct) spread the news
  all over Vermont about the benefits of taking apple cider vinegar.
  The older (and smarter) folks mix one tablespoon of apple cider
  vinegar in a glass of room temperature water then add one tablespoon
  of honey to that. The apple cider vinegar acts like a rotor rooter in
  your veins and the honey gives energy. You'll notice a remarkable
  improvement in your energy level after a month.

      Title: JOHANNE & PETER'S DIET PIZZA
 Categories: Low-cal, Pizza
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 md Recipe for pizza dough
      1 sm Can crushed tomatoes
           Zuchini
           Onion
           Brocolli
           Mushrooms
           Tomatoe
      1 c  Low fat mozzerella
 
  Make your favorite pizza dough.  Roll out on a floured surface. Fitt
  on to aluminum pizza pan(do not use oil). Cut off excess dough off
  the sides. Pinch up sides to make a crust. Spread plain crushed
  tomatoes over the dough as the sauce.  Put your toppings on as
  desired. Top with Low fat cheese.  Bake @ 450 F for 15-20 minutes or
  until cheese is bubbly and crust is brown.
  
  Note: The taste of the vegetables will compensate for the lack of
  seasonings in the sauce.  Be creative with your toppings, but
  remember that olives are caloric and anchovies are usualy packed in
  oil. Pepperonni is NOT a meat you want to be eating if you are trying
  to loose wieght. The reason for the absence in seasonings in the
  sauce is because I have found when I buy pizza sauce, it usually
  contains oil. You may season your crushed tomatoes if you like.

      Title: JOHN'S WATERMELON SURPRISE
 Categories: Alcohol, Reinactment, Fruits, Beverages
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/3 md Ripe watermelon
      2 cn 12-oz. frozen lemonade con-
           -centrate
      1    Lemon
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 cn Favorite distilled beverage
           -using lemonade cans
 
  Deseed and liquify watermelon without skin or rind, in blender.
  Liquify a peeled and seeded lemon in blender. Add two cans of
  lemonade concentrate following directions for lemonade, but
  substituting alcohol for one can of water per can of concentrate.
  John suggest unbonded whiskey, if available, but otherwise,
  Everclear, vodka or light rum will do. Watch out for the Everclear
  though. If you are in someone elses campsite you may never make it
  back to yours. You may be found in the morning in the dewy grass with
  the ants crawling in and out of your mouth...
  
  Lest we digress...
  
  Add sugar to taste starting with about 1/4 cup.  Cork in an old
  whiskey or wine bottle, or even a mason jar. Keep in the cooler until
  used. Serve to unsuspecting friends and be the hit of the party. Take
  that for what it's worth.
  
  NOTE:  A non-alcoholic version for young'uns, those of us with bad
  livers, or designated drivers, is made by using the lemonade
  concentrate as per directions without the booze. I have to say, the
  flavor is refreshing and tasty.  Those drinking the leaded version
  concur with us drinking the unleaded.

      Title: JOHNNYCAKE WITH CHERVIL
 Categories: Breads, Harned 1994, Herb/spice
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 tb Corn oil
      1 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 pn Salt
      1 c  Yellow cornmeal
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 c  Buttermilk or soured milk
    1/2 c  Fresh chervil, no stems*
           -- loosely packed
 
  *If chervil is unavailable, Italian parsley can be used instead.
  
  Brush a square 8" baking pan with the oil.  Once oven is preheated,
  heat greased pan until hot (but watch carefully). This helps ensure a
  crispy bottom and sides. Muffin or cornstick pans may also be used.
  
  Sift flour with sugar, baking powder and salt.  Stir in cornmeal. In
  separate bowl, mix eggs with oil and buttermilk. Chop chervil leaves
  to yield about 1/4 cup. Stir into milk-egg mixture. Make a well in
  the dry ingredients and quickly pour in liquid.  Blend quickly with a
  spatula just until mixed.  Do not overmix.
  
  Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake at 425 F. 20 minutes, or until
  golden brown and crisp around edges. (Muffins or cornsticks may only
  take 15 minutes). Cut into squares and serve at once, spreading with
  butter if desired.
  
  Save any leftovers and freeze for cornbread poultry stuffing.
  
  Enright suggests serving this with stews, chowders, fried chicken or
  ribs, and also says that this is good with a layered lamb stew.

  immediately add 1 cup cold water. Whip till smooth, then pour into
  the cooked beans.
    Add smoked sausage and 1/2 tablespoon salt. Simmer for 10 minutes.
    Cut smoked meats into small pieces, and add to the soup. Adjust
  salt. Add the sour cream.
    Serve with Little Pinched Dumplings (recipe).
    Almost any type can be used, cranberry or pinto beans, for
  instance. If you use dried beans, sook them overnight first.

  time, allow a good 20 minutes before adding the green beans &

  the middle of preheated 350F degree oven for 1 hour. Remove the cake
  from the water bath, let it cool on a rack, and chill it, covered
  loosely, for 3 hours. Run a thin knife around the inside of the pan
  and dip the bottom of the pan in hot water for 3 seconds. Invert a
  platter over the pan, invert thecake with a sharp rap onto the
  platter, and cut it with a sharp knife dipped in hot water, cleaning
  the knife before cutting each slice.

MMMMM-------------------JONI CLOUD ID# SSMW41A------------------------
    1/2 ga Milk
      1 c  Rice long grain
      1 c  Sugar
      4 tb Butter (OPTIonal)
           Salt
           Cinnamon
           Raisins
 
  Place Milk, Rice and Sugar and a pinch of salt into Crock on Hi. Cook
  for 1 and 1/2 hours. Stir and at this time if you like raisins add
  them, a couple of hands full and sprinkle in some cinnamon. Cook for
  another 1 1/2 hours keeping a check on the last hour stirring often.
  As soon as it starts to thicken turn it off if you like it real
  creamy, let cook longer if you like it thick. It will thicken a lot
  after it cools. I use skim milk, omit the butter, and sometimes if I
  have it on hand add a can of evaporated milk, gives a little creamer
  taste, but either way it is just as good this way and a lot less fat
  etc.

  Place on wax paper on cookie sheet. and chill. In mean time melt
  chocolate coating, and dip the eggs in the chololate and put in the
  freezer for a few minutes, makes them shiny. I also use white
  chocolate and color it pink and green, real light colors for easter.
  Then you can make some of mixture in small balls and coat like a
  BonBon. Yummmy. I use the Dark Chocolate for the coconut eggs, as
  they are on the sweet side. Enjoy Joni in S.Jersey Ruth from PA

  Place Milk, Rice and Sugar and a pinch of salt into Crock on Hi. Cook
  for 1 and 1/2 hours. Stir and at this time if you like raisins add
  them, a couple of hands full and sprinkle in some cinnamon. Cook for
  another 1 1/2 hours keeping a check on the last hour stirring often.
  As soon as it starts to thicken turn it off if you like it real
  creamy, let cook longer if you like it thick. It will thicken a lot
  after it cools. I use skim milk, omit the butter, and sometimes if I
  have it on hand add a can of evaporated milk, gives a little creamer
  taste, but either way it is just as good this way and a lot less fat
  etc.

      Title: JOOK~ CHINESE THICK RICE SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Long Grain Rice
    1/2 c  Glutinous Rice
      5 qt Chicken Broth
      1 lb Ground Pork
      1 tb Dark Soy Sauce
      1 ts Salt
      2 ea Green Onion Stalks
     12 ea Water Chestnuts
 
  Rinse rice 2 or 3 times. Soak overnight. Mince green onions and water
  chestnuts. Mix with ground pork, soy sauce and salt. Bring stock and
  rice to a boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 2-3 hours or until the
  rice breaks down completely and the soup becomes thick and creamy.
  Turn heat up and add ground pork mixture, shaping 1 tsp at a time
  into a small ball and dropping it into the soup. Cook for 5 minutes
  or until pork balls are done. Correct seasoning. Serve in individual
  soup bowls. Pass the condiments around for each person to choose his
  or her favourite toppings. I like Nam-Yuey in mine! You can make this
  ahead of time and reheat. You can also use chicken slices, ground
  beef, beef slices, fish filets or ham slices. A roast chicken or
  turkey carcass is excellent for making the stock. Just cook the
  carcass, rice and water together. Take out the carcass when the soup
  is done. I add Duck Liver Sausage bits! Condiments which you can use:
  Sesame oil, White Pepper, Green Onions, Chinese Parsley (cilantro),
  tea melon (sweet cucumber), Szechwan turnips, chopped peanuts, Deep
  Fried Devils (Yao Ja Guai, which are small fried bread sticks),

      Title: JORDAN POND HOUSE POPOVERS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Popovers
 
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Whole milk
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Flour, all-purpose
           -(Important! Sift
           -before measuring!!)
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Beat the eggs at high speed with an
  electric mixer for 3 minutes, or until the mixture turns lemon
  yellow. Slow the mixer to a crawl and dribble in about 1/2 cup of
  milk, taking about 20 seconds to pour it in.
  
  Into another bowl, sift the flour and measure 1 cup as exactly as you
  can, sift 100 g flour then add salt and baking soda and sift again.
  With the mixer still running on its slowest speed, add the dry
  ingredients to the eggs and milk. Turn the mixer off and use a rubber
  spatula to make sure that all of the flour has blended in with the
  liquid.
  
  Set the mixer to medium speed and dribble in the remaining milk.
  Blend for 1 minute. Turn the mixer to its highest speed and beat for
  10 minutes (or 5 minutes if you have a Kitchen-aid style mixer that
  uses a wire whip for beating).  Extra beating can't hurt.
  
  Filter the batter through a fine-mesh screen strainer to remove any
  lumps, then pour into well-buttered popover cups or custard cups. (If
  you must use a muffin tin, fill only the 4 corners.) Bake at 425
  degrees F. for 15 minutes. Without opening the oven, turn heat to 350
  degrees F. and bake for 15 more minutes (20 minutes if your oven door
  has a window).
  
  Serve immediately, with fresh jam and room-temperature butter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Popovers from the Jordan Pond teahouse -- In Acadia National Park,
  near Bar Harbor Maine, is Jordan Pond. A century ago the teahouse at
  Jordan Pond was a gathering place where the aristocracy had tea and
  popovers with strawberry jam each day at 4 o'clock.
  
  The Jordan Pond Tea House burned down in 1978, but has been rebuilt.
  It now serves people sporting clothes announcing "Mommy and Daddy
  went to Naugatuck, and all they brought me was this crummy shirt,"
  and who show up in station wagons, but the popovers are the same that
  were served to the idle rich of another era. Yield: 2 large popovers.
  
  *  These popovers turn out significantly better if they are baked in
  crockery custard cups rather than in metal or glass.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: JOSE GILES'S POZOLE
 Categories: Mexican, Pork
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 lb To 5 lb fresh ham or pork
           - loin
      1    Or 2 cloves garlic, crushed
      2 tb Coarse salt
      4 qt Water
      4    14 oz cans whole hominy
 
  (6-8 Servings)
  
  In a kettle, add the pork, garlic, salt and water. Bring to the boil
  and simmer until meat is tender.
  
  Remove pork and shred.  Cool the broth and skim accumulated fat.
  
  Put the pork in a large, flat baking dish and add approximately a soup
  ladle of broth to keep the pork moist. Cover with aluminum foil.
  
  Bring remaining broth to boil again and add the hominy, discarding
  half the liquid in the cans.  (This step may be reserved until just
  before serving.) Simmer 20 minutes.
  
  Warm pork in oven before serving.
  
  Extra Ingredients
  
  4    large limes, cut into eighths 4 medium-size avocados, diced in
  1-inch chunks 1 large spanish onion, diced 2 packages Fritos 2
  packages fried bacon rind 1/4 c. crushed red chile 1/4 c. oregano
  
  To keep diced avocado, save the pit and place in serving dish with the
  diced avocado.  This will prevent it from turning brown.
  
  Place all other ingredients in appropriate serving dishes. If onion
  and lime are prepared in advance, cover with foil or plastic wrap.
  
  Serving
  
  In a large soup bowl, serve a small portion of shredded pork and
  hominy with enough broth to fill approximately half the bowl.
  
  Instruct guests that they are to add ingredients gingerly until each
  finds the taste combination that suits his/her palate.
  
  Fried bacon rinds and fritos may be crushed or added whole. Lime is
  squeezed for juice.
  
  Free-for-all.  Everyone is invited to help him/herself to experiment
  with combinations.
  
  Author's Note:  All the quantities are approximations based on
  experience. If guests are delicate eaters, you'll have leftover
  pozole, which is delicious.  If they are heavy eaters, add more meat
  and ingredients.

 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  Molasses
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Fennel seeds
      1 ts Caraway seeds
      2 tb Dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water
           Grated rind of 1 orange
      1 c  Rye flakes or wheat germ
      2 c  Dark or light rye flour
  3 1/2    To 4 1/2 cups uncleached
           -white or whole wheat flour
           Glaze:
      1 tb Molasses
      2 tb Water
 
  Similar to Swedish rye.  Can be toasted.
  
  Heat the buttermilk, molasses, butter or margarine, salt, fennel
  seeds, and caraway seeds until the butter melts. Set aside to cool.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Let it stand for 5 minutes
  until the yeast bubbles.  ((My comment: whisk in some flour and
  molasses to nourish the yeast.)) Add the yeast to the cooled
  buttermilk mixture along with the grated orange rind, rye flakes or
  wheat germ, and rye flour. Beat well until smooth. Add 3 to 3 1/2
  cups of wheat flour, stirring in a cup at a time, until the dough
  will not readily absorb more flour. The dough will be rough.
  
  Flour a work surface with the remaining wheat flour and turn the
  dough out onto it.  Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest
  for 15 minutes. (The gluten in rye is more fragile than in wheat. It
  needs a resting time to recuperate and reform and does not require as
  vigorous or lengthy a kneading).
  
  Gently knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth. Form the
  dough into a ball and place it in a large buttered bowl or pot,
  turning it to coat all sides with butter. Cover it and let it rise,
  in a warm spot, until doubled in size, about an hour.
  
  Punch down the dough and gently knead it for one minute. Form the
  dough into three round loaves and place in lightly buttered 9-inch
  cake pans or on buttered baking sheets. Cover and let rise until
  almost doubled in size, 45 minutes to an hour.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Combine the water and molasses,
  brush the tops with half of this mixture to glaze. Then lightly
  pierce the loaves all over with a fork.
  
  Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the bread sopunds hollow when tapped
  on the bottom.  While the bread is hot, brush it with the remaining
  glaze. Remove the loaves from the pans and cool on racks.
  
  Yields 3 loaves.

      Title: JOYCE'S CHICKEN WINGS
 Categories: Improv, Kohl, Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Chicken Wings
           Flour
           Salt & Pepper
           Crisco shortening
 
  Cut each wing into three sections (I throw away the tiny meatless
  part). Skin the "drumsticks" and cut away excess skin and
  fat/feathery edges of the "double-bone" sections. Salt and pepper
  both sides of each piece.
  
  Put some flour into a bowl (with a lid that fits it). Add salt and
  pepper. Dump all the chicken pieces into the flour, put the lid on
  tightly, then shake to thoroughly cover each piece of chicken.
  
  You can cook right away, but I usually refrigerate the chicken for a
  couple of hours to allow the flour to get sticky. Then pull apart the
  pieces, add flour and shake again while my Crisco is getting hot.
  
  Deep fry the pieces in Crisco shortening...add enough Crisco to a
  skillet to be about 1/2" deep.
  
  Serve while hot with side dishes of hot sauce...my favorite recipe is
  my own...contained in: IT NEVER TURNS OUT THE SAME WAY COOKBOOK A

      Title: JOYCE'S CINNAMON RAISIN BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Joyce Burton
  1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Canola oil*
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Cinnamon
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/2 c  Bread flour
      1 tb Vital gluten
      2 ts Red Star Active Yeast
      1 c  Raisins; floured
 
  *I may have used only 1 tablespoon of the oil (can't remember).
  
  Since I like a lighter crust, I made this in my Zoji on the "Basic
  White Bread" setting with baking degree set on "Light," instead of on
  the "Raisin Bread Setting." I floured the raisins and added them 30
  minutes after the kneading started.
  
  I know I had to add additional water, until the dough "looked right,"
  but I didn't measure it.  I may have added as much as one-fourth cup.
  
  This made a beautiful loaf....almost to the top of the pan. The next
  time I make it, I'll try to remember to write down the amounts!

      Title: JOYCE'S MACARONI SALAD
 Categories: Improv, Kohl, Vegetables, Pasta
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
           Eggs, boiled (when water
           -boils, set timer for 20
           -minutes)
           Macaroni, cooked according
           -to package directions
           Onions, diced
      1    Jar pimentoes, diced
           Celery seed
           Sweet relish
           Salt & pepper
           Miracle Whip Salad Dressing
           Milk
 
  Note: I've never measured the ingredients, but I suggest you use a
  "rule-of-thumb" method: To approximately one quart pan of cooked
  macaroni, use: At least 6 eggs, 1 medium onion, and about 1 heaping
  tablespoon celery seed. Don't use too much relish (I sometimes leave
  it out all together). You CAN use mayonnaise if you prefer, but we
  prefer Miracle Whip for this salad. You'll need about half a quart!
  You can add a smidgen of milk (enough for "washing" out the jar).
  Just be sure your salad is good and "sloppy" ~ and before serving,
  you'll more than likely need to add more Miracle Whip.
  
  Put the cooked and drained macaroni into a large bowl (I use a
  plastic bowl that has a lid). Add peeled chopped eggs, and the rest
  of the ingredients - all except the Miracle Whip and milk. Toss the
  mixture a little and then add Miracle Whip, mixing it well. Cover and
  then refrigerate. Just before serving, you will probably need to add
  more Miracle Whip. Can be topped with sliced eggs and/or paprika.

      Title: JOYCE'S STEAK & MUSHROOM GRAVY
 Categories: Improv, Kohl, Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Good round steak, trimmed &
           -cut into serving portions
           Flour
           Salt and pepper
           Cream of mushroom soup
           Cooking oil or shortening
 
  Salt and pepper each side of the steak pieces. Roll thoroughly in
  flour, coating each side heavily. Fry in hot oil until each side is
  browned (steak doesn't have to be done...just brown). As each piece
  is browned, remove from the skillet and set aside. While the steak is
  frying, open the mushroom soup...at least 2 cans..and put the soup in
  a bowl. Stir it up to smooth it...then gradually add equal amounts of
  water, keeping the mixture smooth. Transfer the steak into a large
  pot. Pour the mushroom soup mixture in with the steak. Bring to a
  boil, then cover and simmer for at least 1-2 hours or longer. You
  should be able to cut the steak with a fork, so the thicker the
  pieces, the longer you cook it. You may also add some milk and/or
  water, but not too much. The soup becomes the gravy, so let it boil
  own to gravy consistency. You can also put this in the oven to cook.
  
  Suggestions: Serve with buttery mashed potatoes, fresh green beans,
  and a salad.
  
  NOTE: Even people who ordinarily do not like mushrooms like this!
        In fact, if you don't tell them about the mushrooms, chances
        are they won't even know it....

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 cn Evaporated milk
      1 cn Sweetened condensed milk
      2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Water
      1 tb Vanilla extract
    1/2    Lemon; juice only
      8    Eggs
 
  Preheat oven to 375 . Mix eggs, condensed milk, evaporated milk, 1
  cup of the sugar, vanilla and lemon juice in large bowl. Mix well, no
  solids allowed, and the sugar must blend very evenly. (Add a little
  bit of Amaretto or Bailey's Irish Cream if you feel adventurous, or a
  little softened cream cheese). In a meat loaf or bread mold, put the
  remaining 1 cup of sugar and the water tilt the mix so that becomes a
  syrupy mix. Heat on high, watching it and moving it every once in a
  while to spread the heat evenly. When it starts to turn brown, take
  it off the heat. The syrup should be a medium caramel color. Put it
  in the freezer and let it set. After the caramel sets, pour in the
  flan mixture you made in the bowl. Cover TWICE and seal well with
  aluminum foil. Put the mold inside another larger pan (double boiler)
  and fill the middle with water so that it almost reaches the edge of
  the inside mold. It is VERY important to seal the top of the mold; if
  steam or hot air gets inside the flan will not come out creamy and
  firm (it will look like swiss cheese on the outside). Set oven to
  BAKE and cook for 1 hour. Turn oven off and let it cool, then take
  the flan out, remove from the larger pan and put it in the fridge to
  cool. Ought to serve 8 or so, but I've seen it serve 1 over 3-days.
  It will last quite a bit as long as it is refrigerated. +++++DON'T

      1 ts Coriander (crushed or

      2 tb Maggi Seasoning
    1/4 c  Tiger Sauce
     16 oz Beef broth
      2 c  Tomato sauce (15 oz. Each)
      1 c  Tomato paste (12 oz)
      1 c  Italian plum tomatoes,
           -whole, diced
      2 tb Masa Harina (or flour)
      1 lb Black beans (optional),
           -soaked overnight
      1    Beer from a good
           -microbrewery like Ballard
           -Bitters

           -for garnish
           -Monterey Jack cheese,
           -shredded, for garnish
 
  Wash beans carefully and soak in enough salted water overnight to
  cover them by 2 inches of water.  Bring to a boil and simmer the next
  day until tender (usually 2-3 hours).
  
  In the meantime, heat 2 tblsp of oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add
  garlic, onions, bell peppers, and celery. Cook until the onions are
  clear. Remove and reserve.
  
  Mix ground meats.  Add 1 T.  Oil to skillet and saute meat, cooking
  on high heat until thoroughly browned. Drain fat. Remove ground meat
  and reserve. Brown cubed meat, drain, and reserve. Place reserved
  vegetables and meats in chili pot along with linguica (or Andouille).
  Add all remaining vegetables, spices and liquids (except the beer,
  Masa Harina, or beans), a little at a time, stirring and mixing
  thoroughly between additions. Carefully bring temperature up to a
  simmer.
  
  Cook covered on very low heat approximately 5 hours. Adjust the
  consistency after 3 hours.  If too thin, uncover and reduce by
  turning up heat (carefully) slightly. If it is still not the desired
  consistency, add masa harina (or flour) to thicken, beer to thin, as
  needed. Taste and adjust for spices carefully (the flavor will
  develop as the chili cooks). It should be hot enough to be memorable,
  but not so hot it takes the skin off the roof of your mouth.  ItUs
  better to sneak up on hot. You canUt take it out. If it cries out to
  be hotter, add just enough Louisiana hot sauce.
  
  Finally, and only if you absolutely must, add the beans. A chili
  purist would jettison them without a second thought. If you canUt
  bring yourself to do it, but want to serve the chili beanless as God
  intended, serve the beans on the side and let people indulge their
  own leguminous perversions.
  
  Serve topped with chopped Walla Walla sweets, shredded Monterey Jack
  cheese, and a pinch of parsley.

  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
  2 1/4 c  Buttermilk
  1 1/2 c  Thick sour cream
  1 1/2 tb Instant coffee crystals
      2 c  Sweet butter
  2 1/4 c  Sugar
  2 1/4 c  10x powdered sugar
      3    Eggs
  2 1/4 c  Heavy cream
 
  I.  THE CAKE:
      1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease 3 round, 9" cake pans.
  Line bottoms with greased wax paper.
      2. Sift together flour, 3/4 c cocoa, baking soda, baking powder
  and cinnamon. Mix in buttermilk and coffee (dissolve coffee in an
  equal amount of hot water first.)
      3. Cream 1 1/2 c butter with the sugar until light and fluffy.
  Add the eggs one at a time until thick. Beating on low speed, slowly
  mix in buttermilk mixture. Beat 'til well blended. Bake about 35
  minutes, or until a straw comes out clean.
      4. Remove to racks to cool.  After they are cooled, put in
  'fridge'. After 1 hour in 'fridge', split each in half (see note at
  bottom.) Wrap each layer in wax paper or plastic wrap, and freeze
  immediately. II. SOUR CREAM FILLING:
      1. Beat 3/4 c heavy cream, gradually adding 3/4 c
       10 x  sugar until stiff.
      2. Gently fold in 3/4 c sour cream.  Set aside in 'fridge'
  (covered.) III. CHOCOLATE SOUR CREAM FROSTING:
      1. Melt remaining (1/2 c) butter.  Add 1/2 c 10x sugar and
  remaining (1/2 c) cocoa.  Stir with a wire whisk over low heat until
  smooth; cool.
      2. Beat remaining (1 1/2 c) heavy cream; add remaining (1 1/2 c)
  10x sugar until soft peaks form. Add cooled chocolate mixture; beat
  until stiff.  Fold in remaining (3/4 c) sour cream. IV. CONSTRUCTION:
      1. Build layers from the bottom up as follows:
      2. Cake, 1/3 the filling, cake, 2/3 c frosting.
      3. Repeat above twice, for total of six layers.
      4. Put remaining frosting on sides.
      5. Chill two hours before serving.
     Note: The cakes must be well-chilled before assembly, or they will
  disintegrate under their own weight during assembly. If the cake tops
  rose during baking, the layers will not stack well. You will need to
  slice the excess off *after* chilling, but *before* splitting into
  layers.

      Title: JUDY'S STIR FRY & SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Lite soy (or regular or
           Watered down regular)
      2 tb Mirin (japanese wine) or any
           Red wine preferably sweet
      3 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Garlic powder (only powder
           Will stir in well)
      1 tb Corn starch

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
    1/2 ts Ginger (or more)
    1/4 ts (or more) red pepper flakes
 
  Combine sauce ingredients in a jar or bowl, mix well and set aside.
  
  Stir fry 3 cups of any veggies, using a wok or non-stick fry pan on
  med-hi heat.  Make sure to the cut the harder veggies (carrots?)
  smaller/thinner than the softer ones (mushrooms, cabbage?), stir fry
  the harder ones first, then add the softer ones last, so that all
  veggies are just crisp tender at the same time. I start with about
  1/2 a cup of veggie broth by the side of the stove and add a
  tabelspoon at a time as needed to keep a little liquid in the wok.
  Do not add so much that the veggies are sitting in the broth. Always
  keep stirring or moving veggies around with a spatula so that they do
  not sit in the liquid (that's why they call it stir-fry!)
  
  Some veggies I recommend:  mushrooms, any kind of onion or scallion
  (green onion) or shallot, napa (chinese) cabbage, carrots, zucchini,
  red or yellow or greeen bell peppers, y ams cut into matchsticks,
  celery, jicama (don't overcook, leave crunchy) snowpeas, asparagas . .
  
  When veggies are ready, stir or shake sauce well to keep corn starch
  well-mixed in, and pour over the veggies in the pan. (If you have a
  wok, always introduce new liquids by pouring them down the sides of
  the pan so that they can pick up heat on the way down and begin
  steaming immediately.) Continue to keep viggies moving around the pan
  by stirring with a spatula. The corn starch will cause the sauce to
  thicken within a minute or so and will give it a sheen as if there is
  oil in it.
  
  Serve over rice or noodles immediately.

 Categories: Desserts, Breakfast, Snacks, Vegetarian
      Yield: 12 Rolls

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      1 c  Milk
      2    Eggs
    1/3 c  Margerine; softened
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt

      1 pk Dry yeast; (i like saf brand

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  1 1/2    Sticks margerine; softened
  1 1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
      3 tb Cinnamon; rounded generously

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      1    Stick margerine; softened
      4 oz Cream cheese; softened
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/8 ts Salt
 
  To make Cinnabons in the bread machine use the dough setting. Remove
  from the Bread machine. FILLING: Spread dougn with the softened
  margerine and sprinkle evenly with the brown sugar/cinnamon and roll
  with a rolling pin. Roll up jelly roll fashion and cut sharp with a
  knife into 12 rolls, about 2" thick. Place rolls in a greased 9 x 13
  pan - 3 rows of 4 rolls each. You can bake them right away without a
  second rise (yes, that's right) but I like to lwt them rise about 15
  minutes in a warm spot, ten bake them in a 400~ oven for about 13-14
  minutes. While they're hot from the oven, spread them gently with a
  little of the icing. Add more icing after 5 to 10 minutes. NOTE:
  After placing them in the pan, you can cover them and refrigerate or
  you can freeze them for up to a month. Before baking allow them to
  come to room temperature, then let rise for 15 minutes in a warm spot
  and bake as directed above.

  with the blood and the bones, which have also been washed. 3. Add
  four pints of cold water and a teaspoon of salt, and bring the stock

  add also the pepper and mace. 4. Scrape and wash the carrot, peel the
  onion, and stick the cloves into it, and add these to the stock,
  simmer all the ingredient for three or four hours; keep well skimmed
  to remove the grease. 5. Flour the joints of hare, melt some butter
  or shortening in a pan, and fry the joints lightly so as to brown
  them slightly. Then place in a large brown jar or casserole. Mix some
  flour to a smooth paste with water. When the stock is ready three to
  four hours, strain it into another saucepan and add the thickening
  flour mixed with water, stir well and boil for a few minutes. If
  necessary add a few drops of browning. 6. Strain the gravy over the
  fried hare, the hair should be just covered. Place in a moderately
  hot oven, and cook for about two hours. Just before serving, add to
  it the port wine. 7. To serve. Heap the hare into a large dish, pour
  some of the gravy round, the remainder is served separately. Serve

      Title: JUJI'S NAAN (LEAVENED FLAT BREADS)
 Categories: Breads, Indian
      Yield: 9 Loaves
 
  3 1/4 c  Unbleached white flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Plain yogurt
           Unsalted butter (optional)
           -- softened
 
  Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Slowly add as
  much yogurt as you need to gather the flour together and make a soft,
  resilient dough. Knead for about 10 minutes and form a ball. Put the
  ball in a bowl and cover the bowl with a damp dishcloth. Set aside in
  a warm place for 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Knead the dough again and divide
  into nine equal parts. Keep them covered.
  
  Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over a lowish flame, and preheat
  the broiler.
  
  Take one of the parts of dough and make a ball out of it. Flatten it
  and then roll out on a lightly floured surface until you have a round
  that is about 1/8 inch thick. When the skillet is very hot, pick up
  the naan and slap it onto the heated surface.  Let it cook slowly for
  about 4 to 5 minutes.  Now put the skillet under the broiler for 1 to
  1-1/2 minutes or until the puffing-up process is complete and there
  are a few reddish spots on the naan.  Remove the naan with a spatula
  and brush with butter if you like.  Make all the naans this way,
  keeping them stacked and covered with a clean dishcloth.  Serve hot.
  
  If you wish to have the naans later, wrap them in a plastic bag when
  they have cooled.  Before you eat, wrap as many as you need in
  aluminum foil and heat in an oven at 400 F for 15 minutes.

  sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl about 25
  times. Trun off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.
  
  Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining milk to
  make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
  dough turns around bowl about 15 times.
  
  Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Knead in raisins and citron.
  Shape into ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning to grease
  all sides. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in warm
  place until doubled, about 1 hour.

      Title: JULIA CHILD'S FAVORITE ROAST CHICKEN *JB
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 tb Unsalted butter
    1/3 c  Each finely diced carrots,
           --onion and celery
      1 ts Thyme, savory or mixed herbs
           --or 2 fresh thyme sprigs
      4 lb Fresh chicken
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
           Parsley stems &celery leaves
      6    1/8-inch thick lemon slices
    1/2 c  Each sliced onion & carrot
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
    3/4 c  Chicken stock or broth
 
  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a skillet.  Add the diced carrots,
  onion and celery and cook over moderate heat until softened about 5
  minutes. Stir in the herbs.
  
  Wash the chicken rapidly inside and out with hot water and pat
  thoroughly dry.  For easier carving, cut out and discard the
  wishbone. Pull the neck skin up over the breast and secure it to the
  back with a toothpick. Salt and pepper the cavity and spoon in the
  cooked vegetables, a handful of parsley stems and celery leaves and
  the lemon slices. Massage the chicken all over with 1 tablespoon of
  the butter then truss it. (Alternatively, tie the ends of the
  drumsticks together and tuck the wings under the body)
  
  Preheat oven to 425F.  Choose a flameproof roasting pan that is 1 inch
  larger than the chicken.  Salt the bird all over and set it breast up
  on a rack in the pan.
  
  Roast the chicken in the oven for about 1 1/2 hours, as follows:
  
  AT 15 MINUTES:  Quickly brush the bird with the remaining 1/2
  tablespoon of butter.  Scatter the sliced vegetables around the bird.
  Reduce oven temperature to 350F.
  
  AT 30 MINUTES:  Baste the chicken with the pan drippings.
  
  AT 45 MINUTES:  Brush the lemon juice over the chicken, Add 1/2 cup of
  water to the pan to prevent the vegetables from burning.
  
  AT 60 MINUTES:  Baste with the pan drippings.  Begin testing chicken
  for doneness: the drumsticks should move fairly easily in their
  sockets and their flesh should feel somewhat soft. If not, continue
  roasting, basting and testing every 7-8 minutes.
  
  Spear the chicken through the shoulders and lift it up to drain; if
  the last of the juices run clear yellow, the chicken is done. Set it
  on a carving board and discard string. Let rest for 15 minutes.
  
  Spoon all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the juices in pan. Add the
  stock and boil rapidly until reduced and lightly syrupy. Strain the
  juices -- you will have just enough to bathe each serving with a
  fragrant spoonful.

      Title: JULIA'S CAESAR
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 4 To 6 servi
 
      1 ea Recipe
 
  Here's a recipe, from Wine Spectator, for Caesar salad. They say in
  the article that it was invented by restaurateur Caesar Cardini, an
  Italian immigrant, in 1924 at Caesar's Palace, Tijuana. The original
  had no anchovies, just the hint of anchovies from the Worcestershire
  Sauce. The recipe is by Julia Child, in consultation with Caesar's
  daughter Rosa. I haven't tried it, it just seems like something the
  echo would like to read about.
  
        2 lg large crisp heads Romaine
         -lettuce
        2 lg cloves garlic 1/2 t salt
        9 T  olive oil
        2 c  unseasoned croutons
    2    eggs 1/4 c fresh grated parmesan
         -juice of 1 lemon
         -fresh ground black pepper
         -Worcestershire sauce
  
  For each person select 6 to 8 whole leaves of Romaine, 3 to 7" long.
  Wash, drain, wrap in paper towels, and refrigerate until serving. Put
  garlic through a press and mix with 1/4 tsp salt and 3 Tbs oil.
  Strain into medium fry pan.  Heat to warm and add croutons, toss
  until well coated and remove to a bowl.
  
  Coddle eggs by boiling one minute.  (Burt: A bare minimum tip of the
  hat to the recent scare about raw eggs)
  
  To assemble salad, have all ingredients in small bowls surrounding a
  large salad bowl.  Put romaine into large bowl and pour 4 Tbs olive
  oil over it. Toss. Add 1/4 tsp salt, 8 grinds of pepper, and 2 more
  Tbs oil, and toss again. Add lemon juice, 6 drops of Worcestershire
  sauce and the eggs, and toss.  Add cheese and toss. Add croutons and
  toss twice more.
  
  To serve, arrange leaves on plates, stems out, w/sprinkling of
  croutons on side.  Eat with fingers or forks and knives. (Burt: The
  original was eaten with the fingers.)
  
  CROUTONS:  Cut baguette of french bread into 3/4" cubes. Toss in 1/4
  cup olive oil, and put on baking sheet. Bake at 350 f. for 20 to 25
  minutes, tossing a few times to brown evenly. Just before done (?)
  turn the oven off and let sit 15 minutes before removing. Makes about
  4 1/2 cups.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 pk Manicotti
           -(12 or so shells)

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 lb Tomatoes, crushed
           -(1 large can)
      2 lb Tomatoes, whole
           -(1 large can)
      4 tb Tomato paste
      6    Garlic cloves
           -(or less)
      2 c  Onions, chopped
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      2    Bay leaves
      1 tb Basil
      1 tb Oregano
    1/2 ts Tarragon
    1/4 ts Thyme
    1/4 ts Rosemary
    1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
           Cayenne pepper,
           -to taste
      1 ts Parsley, preferably fresh,
           -but dry will do
      1 ds Red wine, dry

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
      1 lb Ricotta
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Mozzarella, shredded
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
    1/2 c  Romano cheese, grated
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      1    Garlic clove, crushed
 
  MAKE SAUCE:  Saute onions in large pot with olive oil over medium
  heat. Add crushed garlic.  Cook until onions start to brown. Add cans
  of tomatoes along with paste, breaking any large chunks. Add in
  seasonings and red wine. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20-30
  minutes.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  mix filling ingredients in bowl, reserving about 1/2
  cup of the shredded mozzarella to sprinkle on top.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cook manicotti until they are al dente
  (follow the instructions on the box). Drain and stuff each with
  filling mixture. Cover baking pan with about 1/2 inch of sauce, and
  arrange stuffed shells on top. Cover with sauce and reserved
  mozzarella. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about 20 minutes, until cheese
  is nicely browned and sauce is bubbling.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is my (American) recipe for stuffed manicotti shells. Perhaps
  it's not authentic, but it's tasty. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  While I prefer to use true manicotti, regular pasta shells are
  easier to stuff and it's okay to substitute. You can also cut each
  manicotti down one side and rewrap it around the stuffing. This
  freezes well uncooked; cover with plastic wrap and foil. Let it
  defrost in a 200 95 oven for an hour or overnight in the
  refrigerator. The cheese mixture can be modified to suit your tastes.
  Cottage cheese can be substituted for the ricotta.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: JULIA'S PT
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Eggs; beaten
     15 g  Butter
           -OR- sunflower margarine
    175 g  Leeks, cooked and chopped
    1/2    Canned pimento
      1 tb Summer herbs
           -(finely chopped)
      6    Black olives, stoned
           -- to garnish
           Salt to taste
 
  This very unusual pt, made with leeks, herbs and pimento, is lovely
  food. The distinctive flavours of the ingredients are not, however,
  overpowering - they are well balanced by the eggs, which bind them
  into a soft consistency.
  
  Scramble the eggs in the butter or margarine until lightly set, then
  leave to cool on a plate. Liquidize them, with the leeks, pimento and
  herbs, to a pure. Season to taste. Pack into a small dish, and
  garnish with granary toast.

      Title: JUMBO LUMP CRABCAKES~ CUCUMBER CARROT SALAD A
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Make the Base:
      1 c  Soy oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onion, small dice
    3/4 c  Chopped peppers (red, green
           -and yellow), s
      3    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
    1/4 c  Dijon mustard
    1/2 tb Tabasco
      1 tb Vietnamese fish sauce
      1 lb Jumbo lump crabmeat,
           -uncleaned
  1 1/2 tb Each of fresh dill, chives
           -and parsley, cleaned,
           Stems
  1 1/2 c  Fresh bread crumbs (crusts
           -removed)
      1 c  Japanese bread crumbs,
           -(Panko)
      1 tb Freshly ground white pepper
      2    Eggs
           Vegetable oil for sauting
 
  Method: Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a sauce pan over medium
  heat, place the oil, onions and peppers, and simmer until the
  vegetables are tender, about 7 minutes. Combine the 3 egg yolks, lime
  juice, mustard, Tabasco, fish sauce in a large bowl. Remove the oil
  and vegetables from the heat. Slowly pour into the yolk mixture,
  whisking constantly. Begin by pouring with small splashes,
  incorporating the oil completely before adding more. The heat of the
  oil will cook the yolks as you go, and you should end up with a
  hollandaise-like sauce when all the oil has been blended. Return the
  saucepan to the heat for 30 seconds, whisking constantly to insure
  that sauce is fully incorporated. Set the saucepan down over a bowl
  of ice and whisk to cook quickly. Refrigerate the sauce covered,
  until it is well-chilled. Make the Chipotle Sauce: 2 chipotle peppers
  in 1 tablespoon. adobo sauce 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 tablespoon
  chopped shallots 1/2 cup of cilantro, washed and roughly chopped 1/2
  cup seasoned rice vinegar 1 lemon, juiced 2 cups soy oil Process all
  the ingredients, except for the soy oil. With the machine running,
  add the oil in a slow stream until the sauce is emulsified. Taste.
  Add more oil if necessary. Reserve. Make the crab cakes: Pick over
  crab meat to remove any shell pieces. Add the herbs and gently toss,
  taking care not to break up the crab. Add two or three heaping
  tablespoons of the chilled sauce base to the crab and gently combine.
  Add enough of the bread crumbs to bind the crab mixture. Check to see
  that the mixture is moist (the bread crumbs will absorb moisture as
  the crab mix sits) and add more sauce or bread crumbs as needed. Add
  the white pepper and taste for seasoning. Form the crab into little
  cakes, about 2 inches in diameter. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs.
  One at a time, coat each crab cake with egg. Then coat with Japanese
  bread crumbs. Heat 1/4 of vegetable oil in a large saute pan over
  medium heat. SautJing in batches, brown the crab cakes on both sides
  and reserve on a platter. Place in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for
  2-3 minutes to heat through, and serve. Make the Nuoc Cham Sauce 2
  small cloves garlic, peeled and chopped 1 Serrano chiles, seeded and
  chopped 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 cup rice vinegar 1 tablespoon lemon
  juice 1 tablespoon lime juice 1/4 cup Vietnamese fish sauce 1/2 cup
  soy oil 1/2 small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced 2 whole medium
  carrots, peeled 1 large turnip, peeled and sliced into matchsticks
  using a mandolin 1 gourmet cucumber, scored and split 3 tablespoons
  fresh mint, chiffonade Cut the vegetables and make the salad . Blend
  salad ingredients and toss in 1/2 cup of Nuoc Cham Sauce. To Serve:
  Artfully arrange the salad at one end and two crabcakes at the other.
  Drizzle the Chipotle sauce in between the two in a zig zag pattern.
  Wine Suggestion: Sauvignon Blanc. Yield: 12 crabcakes, or 6 first
  course servings. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1

  scored lines; lay other rectangle of pasta on top.  Press, with
  fingers, around filling to seal.  Use pastry wheel or knife to cut
  between the mounds. In a large saucepan, bring 2 quarts water and 1
  tablespoon oil to a boil. Add ravioli; cook gently for 5 to 7
  minutes, or until edges are tender. Remove with slotted utensil
  (spoon or spatula). Serve with tomato sauce and cheese.

 Categories: Hungary, Salad
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8    Good sized red potatoes
      1 sm Onion minced
      2    Ribs of celery,
           -sliced thin
      4    Eggs hard boiled

    1/2 ts Salt
           Pepper
 
  In summer we usually made and ate cold Sour Cream Potato Salad. In
  winter we made and ate Hot Bacon Potato Salad. This is a traditional
  Hungarian summer Potato Salad, made with sour cream instead of
  mayonnaise. It seems my teen aged life was spent in peeling potatoes
  either cooked or raw. We made tons of Potato Salad. It was
  inexpensive, it kept well, and everyone liked it. It also went well
  with everything from plain cooked hot dogs, to home baked hams.
  Regards, June Meyer. Wash potatoes and cook in boiling water until
  tender. Do not over cook or salad will get mushy. Drain potatoes,
  cool and peel. Slice into small pieces and place in mixing bowl with
  minced onion, sliced celery, chopped eggs, and diced pimento. Into
  bowl with these ingredients place the sour cream, vinegar, sugar and
  salt. Mix all with two large spoons, or as grandma did with your
  hands. Taste, if more salt is needed, add and add a few dashes of
  pepper. Let the Potato Salad rest in the refrigerator for a few hours
  to blend flavors. Put into a serving dish. Sprinkle a little Paprika
  on top and sprinkle some chopped flat parsley on for beauty. Serve
  cold.

      Title: JUNE MEYER'S AUTHENTIC HUNGARIAN APPLE STRUDE
 Categories: Fruit, Pastry, Hungary
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Package of Filo dough
  1 1/2    Sticks of butter, melted
      2 lb Apples, peeled,
           -cored, and sliced thin
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Toasted breadcrumbs
      1 lg Clean kitchen towel
           -(used to roll strudel)
 
  Special occasions meant Apple Strudel time. As Christmas and
  Thanksgiving fall in winter when apples were at their best, Apple
  Strudel was then always served. When my Grandma made strudel, she
  would have all hands available helping. The dining room table would
  be covered with a white cloth on which the strudel dough would be
  pulled thin until you could read a newspaper through it. The women
  would walk around the table stretching the dough by lifting it with
  their round knuckles to avoid tears. When all the apple slices and
  ingredients were spread out on the tissue dough, the eldest would
  supervise the rolling up of the strudel by pulling up on the cloth to
  create a big roll of strudel. When the rolling was done, the roll
  would be cut into 6 or 8 sections, the ends tucked under and all
  placed into the oven to bake. When the strudel was done, we children
  would fight to get the thick juice that cooked out onto the pan. It
  was like candy, apple, cinnamon, and butter flavor all mixed
  together. Today we can get apples all year round and purchased Filo
  dough saves a lot of back breaking work.
  
  Here is a simple way of making good Hungarian strudel. Buy FILO
  dough. You will be able to find it where the frozen pastry shells
  are. It is as good as homemade but much less work. Follow directions
  for strudel, using melted butter to brush on filo tissue.
  
  Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Mix apples with crumbs (crumbs help to keep juice in strudel instead
  of flooding pan). Mix suger and cinnamon in a dish. Lay out clean
  towel and put sheets of buttered Filo dough on top. Place apples on
  prepared filo layers that have been brushed with butter. Start
  spreading apples about 3 inches from the edge closest to you (you
  need a clean area so you can get it in the pan. Completly cover the
  rest of the filo dough with apples. Sprinkle cinnimon and sugar mix
  over the apples. Now take the edge of the towel near you and slowly
  start to make a big roll by pulling up and towards you. This is not
  as hard as it sounds. As you are rolling it you can roll it right
  into a greased pan. Then tuck the ends of the strudel underneath
  itself. Brush top with more butter and bake at 350 degrees for about
  1 hour. Brush every 20 min. with butter. Strudel is done when it
  looks like it has collapsed. Cool and cut into slices and dust with
  powderd sugar.
  
  You can vary the filling by adding chopped walnuts, or raisins. If
  you add raisins you must first soften them in hot water and then dry
  them before using. I prefer using just apples.
  
  When you lay out the filo sheets you will want to have at least 4 or 6
  layers buttered one on top of the other. You will have enough sheets
  to make several strudels so buy at least 4 or 5 lbs of apples. It is
  not really a lot of work and you will have a wonderful dessert. WALT

  Every country household had a yard full of chickens. Chicken dishes
  that could be slow cooked on the stove for supper were plentiful and
  cheap to make. Paprikas was a weekly dish for supper. A pot of potato
  dumplings, and perhaps a platter of pickled hungarian peppers and a
  loaf of crusty home baked bread was all that was need for ones well
  being. Every meal was eaten with gusto.
  
  Regards, June Meyer. Brown onions in shortening. Add seasonings and
  chicken, brown 10 minutes. Add water, cover and let simmer slowly
  until it is tender. It will smell wonderful! Remove chicken, add sour
  cream to drippings in pan and mix well. To thicken gravy, mix into a

    1/2 c  Melted butter (no margarine)
    1/2 c  Sugar

    1/2 c  Soft butter melted
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
 
  This coffee cake consists of balls of coffee cake dough made in a
  round tube cake-pan with nuts, cinnamon and a syrup-like glaze on the
  outside. This recipe is not a quick one. It uses yeast in the dough
  and that means a 2 1/2 to 3 hours spent in raising the dough. It is a
  good recipe for a lazy Saturday or Sunday. I always double the recipe
  to make two. One for the freezer and one for afternoon coffee.
  Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Mix sour cream, sugar, salt and yeast. Stir until yeast dissolves. Add
  eggs, softened butter and half the flour. Mix well and add rest of
  flour. Turn dough out on floured board and knead until smooth for
  about 10 to 15 minutes. Place in greased bowl. Cover and let rise in
  warm place until double in bulk for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch
  dough down. Turn over and let rise again for 45 minutes. After second
  rising, form into walnut-sized balls. Melt butter in small cup. Dip
  each ball in melted butter and roll in sugar and walnut and cinnamon
  mixture. Place in layers in 10-inch greased tube pan. Sprinkle any
  remaining sugar-nut mixture or melted butter over the top layer of
  balls. Cover pan with waxed paper and towel and let dough rise again
  45 minutes. Bake 40 to 50 minutes at 375 degrees or until golden
  brown. Run spatula around sides of coffee cake, and invert onto
  plate. To serve, break coffee cake apart with two forks.

  Dill plants, green and feathery, tall and swaying in the breeze

  1 1/2 ts Good vinegar

      1 ts Fresh dill chopped

  Dill grows wild in most Hungarian gardens. Year after year it keeps
  reseeding itself. It grows to great heights. Cool green lacey fronds,
  pungent with the familiar aroma, waiting to be stripped for sauces and
  salads. Mature plants top heavy with seed heads will be hung upside
  down in the canning kitchen to dry for squash and pickles. This dill
  sauce has a creamed base, is sweet-sour and served hot over boiled
  beef and vegetables after the HUNGARIAN BEEF SOUP has been consumed.
  Also serve hot over boiled chicken after the HUNGARIAN CHICKEN SOUP
  has been consumed.
  
  Regards, June Meyer.
  
  You are going to make a basic cream sauce. Start by melting the
  butter in a saucepan. Sprinkle the flour over the butter, stir and
  cook until the mixture foams up. Do not let it brown. Stir in the
  milk, water or stock and cook stirring so no lumps form. When
  thickened, stir in vinegar, sugar, fresh dill and salt. Taste and
  adjust seasoning if needed. Makes over 1 cup. This recipe can be

      1    Seed head and
           -stem of dill
           Boiling water to
           -cover pickles
 
  A family favorite is Dill pickles made in the summer sun. Nothing
  could be easier to make or tastier to eat. All that is needed is a
  secure place in the sunshine where your bottles of sun pickles can
  sit unmolested by little children who can't wait for the pickles to
  be sun cooked. The usual method was to collect the pickles every day
  fresh off of the vine. This way you could have a fresh bottle going
  every other day. We ate a lot of pickles. It takes a few days for the
  pickles to cook. After they are done, the bottle is stored in the
  refridgerator. Cold, crunchy, dilly. We kids would eat them like a
  pop-sickle. The envy of all the neighbor hood kids. Regards, June
  Meyer.
  
  Wash pickles, and split the pickle down the middle with a knive so the
  brine can flow through. Pack pickles in clean jars or bottles. Place
  into bottles the sugar, salt, vinegar, and the dill weed. Pour
  boiling water over the pickles to cover. Stir to mix up the brine,
  and cover with a loose lid or plate and set bottle where the sun will
  shine on it for several hours a day.
  
  At first the pickles will be bright green, but in one or two days
  days more or less depending on the amount of sun, the pickles will
  absorb the brine and have the usual pickle look. The brine will
  change also. When you remove a pickle always use a clean fork.
  Otherwise you will contaminate the brine and spoil the pickle. Never
  use your fingers unless you are going to finish the whole bottle in
  one orgy of pickle eating. Store in the refridgerator.
  
  P.S. Take the pickle bottles in at night. Raccoons have been know to
  raid the bottle.

  Every ethnic cuisine has it's own way of economically stretching a

  its own particular type of dumpling. Soft, spongy, chewy, al dente,
  silky, what ever your desire. Farina dumplings are firmer to the bite
  than the flour kind. They are a wonderful addition to a chicken, beef
  or tomato soup. Very easy to make. This is my mother's recipe.
  Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Mix the soft butter,salt and the 2 eggs well. Add farina 1/4 cup at a

      1    Box of whole
           -mustard seed
      5 c  Sugar
 
  Summer time was never a time of ease and leisure. The produce was
  ripening in the garden and that meant more canning to do. Relishes
  were always a welcome addition to the table during the winter. My
  parents never bought comercially prepared pickles, peppers, relishes.
  We alway made our own. The Green Tomato Relish would rid the garden
  of all the tomatoes that never wanted to ripen. It is a wonderful,
  tasty, spicy relish that will accent any meal. Great with sandwiches.
  Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Slice thinly only the tomatoes, onions and cauliflower. Place the cut
  up vegetables in a large plastic bin. Sprinkle 1 cup of salt over
  vegetables and let it sit over night. Drain well and rinse off salt
  with water. Remove the seeds from the red and green peppers and cut
  up into small pieces. Add the rinsed off vegetables and place in
  large kettle or pot along with the vinegar, mustard seeds. Place the
  mixed pickling spices in a bag or cloth to keep them together so they
  can be fished out later. Mustard seeds remain in the relish. Cook
  until vegetable are soft, not mushy! Remove mixed spice bag and add 5
  cups of sugar. Cook ten more minutes until sugar is melted. Bottle in
  sterilized canning jars. Makes a lot!

      Title: JUNE MEYER'S AUTHENTIC HUNGARIAN HAMBURGERS (
 Categories: Beef, Pork, Hungary
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Ground beef (if you
           -do not want pork,
           -use 1 lb. ground beef)
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      4 sl White bread
      1 ts Salt
      2    Raw eggs
      1 sm Onion finely chopped
      1 cl Garlic, mashed
      2 tb Fresh parsley, minced
           -(use Italian flat
           -parsley for best flavor)
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Water
 
  In old world families, "Hamburgers for dinner" meant a hearty mound of
  meat, fried in fat until it had a rich brown crust. It was served as
  a meal for dinner, along with a vegetable dish, and mashed potato. In
  Austria-Hungary the Hamburger was carried to new heights. This was
  not a simple "make a thin flat patty and fry" recipe. Regards, June
  Meyer.
  
  Saute chopped onion in a little fat or oil. Wet bread with water,
  tear into small pieces. In mixing bowl beat eggs well. Add meat,
  bread and the rest of the ingredients and mix lightly with your
  hands. Form mixture into medium sized balls, about 5 or 6. Flatten
  slightly.
  
  Fry SLOWLY in 1/2 inch of Crisco, lard or oil until tender and all
  sides are nicely browned and some what crispy. Let each side cook
  before attemping to turn with spatula.
  
  Serve hamburgers hot along with a potato and vegetable dish, and
  perhaps Hungarian cucumber salad. Serves 4 (you can double the recipe
  for robust eaters. Leftovers are good the next day cold!) Honest!

  Here is the Hungarian staple food, potatoes. Hungarian have made an
  art of using the potato. There is a summer Potato Salad with Sour
  Cream and Eggs, and a winter potato salad with hot bacon. My father
  was the one that made the dressing for this dish. He would roll up
  his sleeves, put on one of my mother's aprons and slice the bacon and
  fry it just right. This potato salad is best made fresh and served.
  Make the diners wait for the Hot Bacon Potato Salad. You do not want
  it to get cold. Serve warm. Regards, June Meyer. Cook potatoes in
  boiling water until tender. Peel, cut into slices, not too small, and
  place in mixing bowl. Dice and fry in frying pan 1/4 lb. bacon, till
  almost crisp. Do not let burn. Remove diced bacon and place into
  mixing bowl with other ingredients. Peel and dice onion and place
  into reserved bacon fat. Saute a few minutes. Remove sauted diced
  onion with slotted spoon and place into mixing bowl. Into at least 2
  Tbs. bacon fat, cook 2 Tbs. flour until smooth and bubbly, add 3 Tbs.
  vinegar and 2 teaspoon sugar, 1 tsp. salt, and enough water to make a
  medium sauce. (About 1 cup or more). Bring to a boil and cook until
  sauce is thickened. Pour over ingredients in mixing bowl, and toss
  and mix. Taste, if needed add more salt. (Vinegar and Bacon are
  salty, so add salt last).
  
  Serve with hot baked ham, or sausage. Good with a hot bean dish or
  salad.
  
  Salad serves 4.

MMMMM----------------MIXTURE FOR ROLLING KIPFELS---------------------
    1/2 lb Ground walnuts mixed with
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar.
 
  Kipfels or Kifflies were always present at any family gathering, be
  it a birthday, shower, anniversary, wedding or just a get together.
  They are made from a rich dough. Every family had their own recipe
  which was handed down through the generations. You could always
  identify whose Kipfels you were eating, either by dough flavor,
  fillings which contained either poppy seed, prune, apricot, cinnamon
  and chopped walnuts or cream cheese, or by topping or shape. There
  was always an underlying competition among the women as to who's
  Kipfels were best. They are not large, but big enough for three or
  four bites. Kipfels would be stacked into pyramids. They were served
  with coffee after a large meal. You always had room for two or three.
  
  These are Eastern European in origin. They have their roots in
  Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Yugoslavia, Romania and Turkey.
  There are hundreds of variations. Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Mix yeast and warm water in a small dish and proof according to yeast
  directions. Mix flour and shortening together in a large bowl till
  like pie dough, only finer. (I use my wire pastry cutter). Add all
  other dough ingredients including yeast mixture and work with your
  hands till well mixed and dough comes away from your hands and pan.
  If it seems dry, add the lemon juice, 1/2 lemon at a time until soft
  enough to mix.
  
  Let rise in a warm place till double in bulk. (I turn on the light in
  my oven and keep the door closed).
  
  When dough has risen, pull off about 1/4 of a cup or a small egg sized
  piece of dough for each cake and flatten to the size of a baby's hand
  (do not roll with rolling pin) but push into shape.
  
  Squeeze out about 1 tsp. of Lekvar (see recipe index) jam, and pinch
  up dough to cover the Lekvar jam entirely. Roll in Ground Nut
  mixture. Place on a greased baking pan. Let rise again for about 3/4
  of and hour. Bake at 350 or moderate oven, 25 to 30 min. or till
  lightly brown.
  
  Cakes should be placed close together in pan, but do not crowd too
  closely. My kipfels look like a lot of fat little bundled up babies!
  
  Makes 50, more or less.

           -with fork
      2 tb Good vinegar
 
  Hungarian soups are usually served in the fall and winter months.
  When ever I make a large pot of soup in winter, the steam always
  condenses on the windows. I then always think of a remote memory I
  have of playing by a low window, water running down in little
  riverlets, and shadowy forms passing by single file on the other side
  of the window, and the wonderful smell of soup cooking. When I asked
  my mother about the memory she said that my paternal grandmother had
  died in January 1936, and family and guests were coming back from the
  cemetary after the burial. It was frigid out and Hungarian soup,
  bread and Strudel was made to feed the frozen mourners. I was two
  years old and that faint memory has stayed with me for my whole life.
  
  Never a separate course by itself, but always the main course. This is
  another one of those hearty Peasant soups that is a complete meal by
  itself. Serve it with some crusty bread, a chunk of cheese and a dark
  beer. Serve in a large bowl steaming hot. Regards, June Meyer.
  
  In a large pot, heat fat and add carrots, root vegetable and onions.
  Saute until onions are golden. Add lentils, water, celery, and
  seasonings. Grate the potato into the mixture and add sausage. Simmer
  covered 1 hour until lentils and vegetables are tender. Remove bay
  leaves. Add vinegar just before serving and adjust salt. Serve with a
  crusty bread and salad.
  
  Mongol Soup
  
  If you add one can of tomato paste and two cans of water to the above
  soup and puree it, you will have made another soup called Mongo Soup.
  Try it, it is good.

  Great Aunt Miller was my Grandfather Seine's sister. A wonderful

  patiently at the table. We waited for a large bowl of chicken soup,

  dumplings, cut into the simmering soup. Easy to make, hard to forget.

  How I loved to eat Hungarian Beef Soup with Rivilchas. A tiny chewy
  dumpling for Hungarian soups, they were made fresh and cooked in the
  soup in the big stock pot after the meat and whole vegetables were
  removed to a separate serving platter. They cook up chewy, better
  than any noodle. My Mother would guickly mix the stiff dough and
  grate it into irregular gratings of dough. Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Mix the flour, eggs and salt together. Knead to make a stiff dough.
  You may add a little water if the dough is too stiff. Grate on the
  medium side of a grater. Rivilchas should be the size of dried peas.
  
  Drain and serve in hot Beef Soup, hot Chicken Soup or Tomato Soup.
  
  Note: If you have a large pot of boiling soup, you can cook these
  Rivilchas in the soup.

 Categories: Hungary, Sausage
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     10 lb Coarse ground pork
           -butt or pork shoulder
    1/3 c  Imported mild Hungarian
           -Paprika. (Do not
           -substitute generic)
    1/4 c  Salt
      2    Heaping Tb
           -ground Allspice
      5    Or 6 garlic cloves
      2 c  Water
 
  My father was only 5 years old when he came to America from Romainia
  in 1905. He made sausage, wine, beer, smoked bacon, and all the
  Hungarian dishes that were brought to America by my maternal
  relations. He had a gusto for life. Everything he did he did when
  whistling. You knew he was happy.
  
  Our city house always had a small smoke house at the back of the
  yard. It was used to sugar cure bacon the hungarian way, and to smoke
  links of Hungarian Sausage. My father would make sausage when it got
  cold out, and we would eat some fresh cooked, and the rest would be
  smoked and dried like pepperoni to be used in Potato Soup or
  Sauerkraut dishes all winter long. (The fresh sausage freezes well.
  Years ago we did not have large freezer, so sausage was smoked to
  keep good).
  
  This sausage is heavy on garlic and paprika. If you do not have a
  sausage stuffer you can still make this sausage by making patties and
  frying it in a pan. The recipe that follows is for fresh sausage.
  Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Bring water to boil, add peeled cloves of garlic and simmer 20
  minutes. Fish out cloves of garlic and mash them with a little water.
  Add this to remaining water and mix all of the garlic water into the
  meat mix. Mix everything together well. Keep the meat mix cool. If
  you stuff the mix into casings, let the sausages hang for a day in at
  least 20 degrees. Smoke sausage according to your smoker
  instructions. If you are not going to stuff into casings, form into
  patties, wrap and freeze.
  
  HOW TO COOK HUNGARIAN SAUSAGES
  
  Take as many fresh links as needed and place in a heavy frying pan
  with a cover. Pour water over the sausages so the links are in 1/2
  inch of water. Cover.Start the water to a slow boil, turn down the
  heat and simmer the sausage in the water until the sausage starts to
  take on color. Turn the sausage over and add a little more water to
  keep it from burning. When both sides are brownish, leave the cover
  off and continue cooking slowly to cook away any remaining water.The
  sausage should be a nice rich red brown. The aroma will be heavenly.
  
  Dried and smoked sausage is used like pepperonni.
  
  My brother Frank Wischler carries on the tradition of sausage making.
  He makes Italian sausage by leaving out the PAPRIKA and the ALLSPICE.
  Use 2 ounces of whole fennel seed instead.
  
  This sausage is traditionally served with SOUR CREAM AND HORSERADISH
  SAUCE. Potatos and a sauerkraut dish go well with this dish too.

      Title: JUNE MEYER'S AUTHENTIC HUNGARIAN SMOKED BUTT
 Categories: Hungary, Pork
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Smoked pork butt
      3 tb Brown sugar
      2 qt Water
 
  Smoked butt made in the Austrian-Hungarian style is wonderful and
  economical eating. The butt is cooked in brown sugar water. I find
  that the smoked butt is small enough to last for a few meals. It
  usually weighs about 3 to 4 pounds, is not full of fat. If you have
  not tried a smoked butt, you will be in for a surprise. It has very
  good smoked ham flavor. It makes a wonderful "corned beef and
  cabbage" meal for Saint Patrick's Day, but cooks much faster than
  corned beef. Only 40 minutes a pound and it is done, versus hours for
  corned beef. No fatty waste. Regards, June Meyer. Place Butt in pot
  large enough to hold at least 2 quarts of water (enough to cover
  butt), add the brown sugar and simmer on top of stove in covered pot,
  40 minutes to each pound of butt.
  
  When done, remove butt from pot but do not throw away cooking liquid.
  Slice and serve warm with boiled or mashed potatoes and vegetable.
  Sour Cream Coleslaw on the side is nice.
  
  The wonderfully flavored cooking water is used to make a delicious
  soup, with the addition of cabbage, tomato, onion, potatoes. (See
  Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup recipe).
  
  Smoked butt is versatile and full of tender meat.
  
  NOTE: Hungarian style Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup takes advantage of
  the very flavorful broth or cooking liquid remaining after cooking
  butt made in the Austrian-Hungarian style. The butt is cooked in
  brown sugar water. (See Smoked Butt Hungarian Style) I usually make
  the butt and the Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup on the same day, but
  serve the soup the next day. It is a hearty and filling soup, a
  favorite with the children. Regards, June Meyer.

           -sour cherries
           -(Do not use canned)
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
 
  Every Family has their version of Sour Cherry Soup. It is a special
  seasonal treat in Hungary when the cherries are ripe. Sour Cherries
  have a wonderful flavor when cooked. Some families like to make their
  soup with sweet cream instead of sour cream. Some add a little
  sherry. How ever you make this soup, you will enjoy its refreshing
  flavor. Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Into a soup pot containing 1 1/2 quarts of boiling water add fresh or
  frozen sour cherries and granulated sugar. Stir and cook. In a
  separate bowl mix flour, sour cream, salt and beat until smooth. Add
  to flour mix, 1 cup of hot cherry sugar mix. Stir vigorously. Now add
  the flour, sour cream and hot cherry mix into the pot of hot soup,
  stir well and simmer for 5 or 6 minutes until it thickens. Cover the
  soup and let cool. Keep cover on while it chills in refrigerator and
  it will not form a thick skin. Serve very cold.
  
  Note: to make Cherry Soup with Sweet Cream or Meggy Leves Mas Modon
  Cook a 1 inch stick of cinnamon with the cherries, and substitute
  sweet cream for the sour cream. Discard cinnamon stick when done
  cooking soup. Chill as above.  WALT

  boiling salted water. Dip the spoon into the hot water each time to
  keep the batter from sticking to the spoon. Cook only half the batter
  at a time to avoid crowding. Stir the bottom of the pot with a wooden
  spoon so that the dumplings will rise to the top. After the dumplings
  rise, let them cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the water and drain.

  I never knew what spinach was until I was a teenager. My parents
  always planted Swiss chard, with the red veins, because the yield was
  greater than spinach and the flavor was milder. I remember picking
  the Swiss chard and washing those giant leaves for Hungarian creamed
  Swiss chard or spinach. This is creamed spinach with a Transylvanian
  touch. Regards, June Meyer.

  * SEE--June Meyer's Authentic Hungarian Smoked Butt in Brown Sugar
  Hungarian style Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup takes advantage of the
  very flavorful broth or cooking liquid remaining after cooking butt
  made in the Austrian-Hungarian style. The butt is cooked in brown
  sugar water. (See Smoked Butt Hungarian Style) I usually make the
  butt and the Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup on the same day, but serve
  the soup the next day. It is a hearty and filling soup, a favorite
  with the children. Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Into reserved smoked pork butt and brown sugar cooking liquid, add all
  ingredients. Nice to add any left over smoked butt. Cover pot and
  bring to a boil, lower heat and slowly cool until cabbage and
  potatoes are soft. (About 1 1/2 hours). Adjust seasoning, add salt if
  needed, add more brown sugar if needed.
  
  The soup should have a sweet (from the brown sugar) and sour (from
  the acid in the tomatoes). If you like, you can add a tablespoon of
  good white vinegar or the juice of half a lemon to make it more sour.
  Should be thick and full bodied.
  
  Serve with a dollop of Sour Cream, crusty bread, and beer for a hearty
  meal.

      Title: JUNE MEYER'S AUTHENTIC HUNGARIAN TARHONYA FOR
 Categories: Hungary, Pasta, Dumpling
      Yield: 25 Servings
 
      2 lb Flour
      7    Whole eggs
  1 1/2 tb Salt
      1 c  Water
 
  Tarhonya can also be made in large bulk as the Ancient Hungarians
  made. These were dried hard and stored in a large container for years
  without spoiling. Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Let the Tarhonya dry for 1/2 hour and then add to boiling water 1/2
  cup at a time and cook till done.
  
  Bulk Dried Tarhonya about 25 servings
  
  In a small mixing bowl mix eggs with the water and salt. Beat well.
  Put the flour in a large mixing bowl and add the egg mixture a little
  at a time. Blend the dough with your hands in a rubbing motion as
  though you were washing your hands with the palms open. The mix
  should become uneven little pieces of dough the size of dried peas.
  Break up any that look large. The mix should be somewhat uniform.
  Spread out a tablecloth on a table and spread the Tarhonya on it in a
  thin layer so that all the pieces are exposed to the air. Let dry
  until very hard, this will take 3 or 4 days. While the mix is drying,
  roll your fingers through to mix it up so all sides are exposed to
  air. When you are sure that the mix has dried hard, store in a
  container.
  
  Note: Make Tarhonya in the hot summer, never during a rainy season or
  the mix will never dry hard. If you have some particles that are
  larger and are not hard, sift them out and let them dry separately.
  
  To Bake Dried Tarhonya - serves 6
  
  Brown 1/2 cup of dried Tarhonya in 3 Tbs. of butter or lard. Add 1
  tsp. of salt, 1 Tbs. Hungarian Paprika and water to cover. Cover and
  bake in the oven at 375 degrees. It will take about 35 minutes to 1
  1/2 hours depending on the size and age of the dried Tarhonya. The
  water should be absorbed when the Tarhonya is cooked.
  
  Note: If you have a large pot of boiling soup, you can cook these
  Tarhonya in the soup. Serve instead of potato, noodles, dumplings or
  rice.

    1/2 lb Good bacon,

  Ah Paradise to eat Hungarian Tomato Soup. The tomato once feared as
  being poisonous, was also called the Paradice Appfel or Apple of
  Paradise. When my Grandmother came to this country from
  Austria-Hungary, she brought not only flower seeds, Poppies included,
  but all kinds of old-world tomato seeds. Hungarian heart shaped
  tomatos, heavy, sweet and succulent. It was a yearly ritual in late
  summer to can and bottle all those wonderful ripe tomatos the garden
  produced. All winter long we children would be sent down to the
  preserves cellar to bring up jars of tomatos, peppers, pickles,
  dilled squash, plums, peaches, beets, jams and jellies. Alas, I no
  longer have a garden so I must rely on store bought cans of tomatos.
  
  Hungarian Pancakes, (Palacsinta) were always served after the soup
  course. Thin crepes, slathered with strawberry jam, rolled up and
  sprinkled with powdered sugar. This was a complete meal, good for a
  Saturday noon, or Sunday night. Ah Paradise! Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Saute bacon in a soup pot, and drain off bacon fat. Saute minced
  onion and celery with bacon bits in pot till transparent. Add the can
  of tomatos and add one can of water. Add 1 Tbls. sugar, and
  peppercorns. Bring soup pot to low boil, and lower heat to simmer and
  let simmer about
       45    min. or 1hour. Soup can contain broad noodles, or rice.
  precook these and add before serving. Serves 4 to 6.

  The Story, Birgid Allen:
  
  "(...) This is really a late spring soup, for that time when nothing
  yet seems to be properly in season and when cold winds blight the
  beginning of summer and give one unseasonable longings for warm,
  comforting soups.
  
  This is the time to forget asparagus and turn back to root
  vegetables, such as the new, sharp-tasting young turnips in their
  delicately purple-flushed white skins. These go well with the winter
  and spring perennial, the bulbous Florentine fennel with its faintly
  aniseed-like taste.
  
  The rich, lemony stock, the sharp sorrel and garlicky tomato provide
  a good background for the pungency of the young turnips and fennel.
  It is worth boiling a chicken with a cut lemon inside it to produce
  the right rich, strong broth to pull this soup together, remembering
  that it is easily a meal in itself. (...)"
  
  The Recipe
  
  The day before making this soup, place a cut-up lemon inside your
  chicken and boil for just over 1 hour (for a 1.35 kg/3 pounder),
  adding a peeled onion and carrot, black peppercorns and sea salt to
  the water. Strain off the broth and refrigerate it overnight.
  
  Soak the split peas either overnight or for several hours, then boil
  them in plenty of unsalted water for 30 minutes to 1 hour until they
  are soft. The first 10 minutes of boiling should always be fast and
  uncovered; the rest may be a steady simmer with the lid on.
  
  Meanwhile, peel the onions and turnips, and scrape the carrots and
  fennel; chop them all into small dice and soften them for 15 minutes
  in olive oil in a heavy, covered pan.
  
  Crush the garlic in a mortar with a little sea salt and add it to the
  vegetables with the tomatoes and the thyme or marjoram, raising the
  heat a little and cooking uncovered for 5-20 minutes while breaking
  up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon.
  
  Then add the drained split peas, the skimmed stock and the washed and
  torn-up sorrel leaves. (Spinach will do, but it will not contribute
  such an interestingly acidic flavour.)
  
  Bring to the boil, simmer for 30 minutes, cool and serve. Add more
  salt ift he split peas seem to demand it, but do not liquidize the
  soup unless you want their taste to be dominant.

    1/2 lb Pork tenderloin, trimmed
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      1 tb Minced garlic (3 cloves)
      3 tb Jungle Curry Paste (recipe
           -follows)
      2 c  Defatted chicken stock
    1/2 lb Chinese eggplant, coarsely
           -chopped
    1/2 lb Long beans, trimmed, cut
           -into I inch pieces
      2 tb Fish sauce
    1/4 c  Thinly sliced fresh krachai
           -or:
      2 tb Loosely packed dried *
      2    Fresh kaffir lime leaves or:
      4    Dried **
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh basil
 
  * soaked in warm water for 15 minutes, drained and sliced (optional)
  ** soaked in warm water for 20 minutes and drained, or I tsp. grated
  lime zest
  
  Unlike most other Thai curries, jungle Curry is made without coconut
  milk because coconuts don't grow in the jungles of northern Thailand.
  The curry paste is hot and full of flavor. Kaffir lime leaves give
  this curry its distinctive and enticing flavor, but if they are not
  available, you can substitute grated lime Zest.
  
  Cut pork in half lengthwise and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Set
  aside. In a large, nonstick skillet or wok, heat oil over medium-high
  heat. Add garlic and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until browned. Add
  curry paste and cook for 30 seconds, pressing it against the sides
  and bottom of the skillet or wok. Add pork and stir-fry for 2 to 3
  minutes, or until light brown.  Add stock and bring to a boil. Add
  eggplant, beans, fish sauce, krachai (if using) and lime leaves or
  zest, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the vegetables are
  tender. If using lime leaves, discard them. Remove from heat and stir
  in basil. Serve with sticky rice.
  
  Serves 4 as a main dish or 6 in combination with other dishes.

  won't let you past that field unless you tell it something. Justin
  Wilson says, "Hush puppy is an old Southern term that originated
  after the Civil War. People didn't have enough for themselves to eat
  let alone feed their dogs, so when the old hounds started barking
