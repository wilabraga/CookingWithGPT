      Title: HOMEMADE HAMBURGER BUNS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      3 c  All-purpose flour +
           -additional for kneading
      2 c  Whole-wheat flour
    1/3 c  Toasted wheat germ
      2 pk Active dry yeast
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Solid vegetable shortening
      2 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Sugar
 
  Place 1 1/2 cups each, all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour, the
  wheat germ, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer
  (preferably a heavy-duty one with a paddle attachment), briefly mix
  together the ingredients.
  
  Melt the shortening in a saucepan over low heat. Add the milk and
  sugar and heat until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is very
  warm, but no hotter than 130 degree F.
  
  With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour milk mixture into flour
  mixture until blended. Increase to medium speed and beat for about 2
  minutes.
  
  Add 1/2 cup each of white flour and whole-wheat flour, and beat 2
  minutes more. Add 1 cup white flour and beat until dough pulls away
  from sides of bowl.
  
  Knead dough on a lightly floured surface about 8 minutes, or until
  smooth and elastic. (Use very little additional flour.)
  
  Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise in a
  warm place until double in volume, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Gently punch down dough and divide into 4 equal portions. Divide each
  portion into fourths and let dough rest 5 minutes.
  
  Form portions into balls and with fingertips fold edges under to form
  even circles. Place on lightly greased baking sheets, about 2 inches
  apart. Use your fingertips to flatten each bun to a 3-inch circle.
  (If you prefer the sides of the buns to remain soft, place them
  closer together. As the buns rise, the sides will touch.)
  
  Cover with a towel and set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  Adjust rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees F. at
  least 20 minutes before baking.
  
  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until buns are golden and sound hollow
  when tapped lightly. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
  (Or cool and freeze, well wrapped, for up to 1 week.)
  
  Makes 16
  
  Hot dog buns. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, pat
  or roll out each portion to a rectangle about 14 x 5 inches. Cut
  about eight 5 x 2-inch strips from each rectangle. Roll each portion,
  between your palms into 6-inch long buns. Place buns about 2 inches
  apart on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover loosely with a cloth
  towel and set aside in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake
  as directed for hamburger, buns.
  
  Variation Wheat berry: Add 1/3 cup wheat berries and a dash of salt
  to 2 cups boiling water. Cover saucepan and simmer for 20 minutes.
  Remove from heat, cover, and let cool for about 1 1/2 hours, or until
  tender. Drain and dry well. With wooden spoon, stir wheat berries
  into dough before kneading,
  
  Variation Walnut: Toast 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts in a 325
  degree F. oven about 10 minutes. Cool and with a wooden spoon stir
  into dough before kneading.
  
  Variation Olive: Coarsely chop 1/3 cup pitted oil or brine- cured
  black or green olives. With wooden spoon (or paddle attachment and
  mixer at low speed) stir olives into dough before kneading.
  
  Variation Sesame seed: After shaping buns, lightly brush tops with an
  egg white lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water. Sprinkle sesame seeds
  over glaze. Cover lightly with a towel and let rise before baking.

      Title: HOMEMADE HAND LOTION
 Categories: Misc, Household
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
    1/2    Gill glycerin
    1/2    Gill alcohol
    1/4 oz Gum traganth
    1/2    Gill cologne

  tragacanth is either, but I thought some of you may enjoy looking at
  this recipe and maybe figuring out what those things are!

      Title: HOMEMADE MARSCARPONE
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Heavy cream
    1/4 ts Tartaric acid
           (available from mail
           Order)
           Address follows
 
  The Stars Dessert cookbook by Emily Lucchetti (STARS is a well known
  San Francisco restaurant) contains the following recipe for making
  your own marscarpone cheese. Mascarpone - to yield 2 cups. Line a
  mesh liner with a dish cloth folded over to make a double thickness.
  Rest the strainer over a bowl making sure that the strainer does not
  touch the bottom of the bowl. Set aside.     Heat the cream in a
  double boiler over medium high heat. When the cream reaches 180
  degrees, add the tartaric acid and stir it for 30 seconds. Remove the
  cream from the stove and continue to stir for another 2 minutes.
    Pour the cream into the lined strainer and refrigerate. When it is
  cold, cover with plastic wrap. Let the cream sit in the refrigerator
  for 12 to 18 hours.  It will become very thick and firm. Mascarpone
  will keep for a week in the frig. She says it does not have quite the
  creamy consistency of the store bought but is a good substitute. A
  mail order source of the tartaric acid is STAR MART, 567 Golden Gate
  Ave., San Francisco, CA 94102. It is also used in winemaking so might
  be available for those suppliers too. Cherie Christensen

      Title: HOMEMADE MEXICAN BOLILLOS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
  2 2/3 c  Warm water (110 degrees F.)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
  6 1/2 c  Unbleached bread flour +
           -more for kneading
      1 tb Butter, melted
    1/2 c  Dry milk powder
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 tb Salt
      2 ts Baking powder
      2 ts Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Warm water mixed with
      2 ts Salt
 
  This recipe is the closest I have come to the real bolillos of
  Mexico. The secret ingredient is the cinnamon, which provides that
  elusive Mexican taste.
  
  Pour 2/3 cup of the water into a small bowl. Add yeast and 1/2
  teaspoon sugar. Let proof about 10 minutes until bubbly.
  
  Combine yeast mixture and remaining water in a large bowl. Whisk in 3
  cups of the flour. Set in a warm place for 30 minutes.
  
  Stir in butter, milk powder, sugar, cinnamon, salt and baking powder.
  Stir in remaining flour; turn out on a lightly floured board and
  knead for 10 minutes, adding additional flour, if necessary. Coat
  dough with oil and return to bowl. Let rise until doubled in bulk,
  about 1 hour.
  
  Pour the salt-water mixture into a spray bottle.
  
  Punch down dough and form into oblong rolls about 4 inches long. Each
  bolillo should weigh about 4 ounces. Place on lightly greased baking
  sheets that have been dusted with cornmeal. Let rise about 30
  minutes, or until doubled. Slash tops lengthwise and mist gently with
  the salty water.
  
  Bake in a preheated 375 degree F. oven for 10 minutes. Mist again.
  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. and bake 25 minutes longer,
  until rolls are golden brown.
  
  Makes 12 bolillos.

 Categories: Spread/dips, Sandwiches
      Yield: 4 Ozs
 
           -Robbie Shelton
      1 c  Shelled nuts - cashew halves
           -and pieces, blanched whole
           -almonds, or hazelnuts
           Peanut oil, if needed -
           - (1 to 3 teaspoons)
           Salt to taste
 
  Toast the nuts in the oven or in a skillet until slightly browned. To
  toast in an oven, spread the nuts in a single layer in a shallow pan
  and bake at 350F for 10 minutes, stirring the nuts occasionally so
  they brown evenly. To toast on top of the stove, place the nuts in a
  skillet and cook them over medium-high heat, stirring or shaking the
  pan constantly so they brown evenly.  Be sure that you turn all the
  nuts over frequently as they cook or they will scorch. A teaspoonful
  of oil helps distribute the heat and keep everything moving,
  resulting in more even browning.
  
  Transfer the toasted nuts to a food processor and process 1 minute.
  Stop the machine, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl thoroughly,
  and continue processing another minute or two, scraping the bowl
  occasionally. Eventually the sound will change as the mixture changes
  from finely chopped nuts to a thick, smooth mixture that clings to
  the sides of the bowl. Have patience; this can take two or three
  minutes.  If the nuts refuse to form a butter, add a little oil
  through the feed tube (hazelnuts usually require some oil). When the
  blade spins free, scrape down the mixture one more time and blend a
  few seconds more. Taste the butter and add a little salt if desired;
  process briefly to stir it in. Store nut butters tightly covered, at
  room temperature or refrigerated, and use within a week or so.

 Categories: Breads, Spices, Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Warm water
      1 tb Dry yeast
      3 tb Sugar
      6 c  To 7 c all purpose flour
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Dry italian seasonings
      2 tb Minced fresh garlic
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh basil leaves
      2 tb Chopped fresh oregano
 
  From Sheryl Benesch, Korbel Champagne Cellars.
  
  This pan bread has an Italian heritage.  It does not need butter and
  is best eaten shortly after it has emerged from the oven. It is
  excellent with vegetable soups.
  
  Combine the waterm, yeast, sugar, and approximately 2 cups of the
  flour to make a thick paste.  Mix thoroughly and let stand a few
  minutes until bubbles rise to the surface.
  
  Combine the salt with the remaining flour; add gradually to the yeast
  mixture, until it will absorb no more flour. Knead the dough until the
  texture is smooth and not sticky to the touch; about 5 to 10 minutes.
  Place the dough in an oiled bowl and let it rise in a warm place
  until it has doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, place on a lightly
  floured surface, and knead for another minute. Let dough rest for 5 to
       10    minutes.
  
  Brush a 9 x 13 inch sheet pan with 1/3 of the olive oil. Sprinkle the
  pan with 1/2 tablespoon of the dry Italian seasonings and 1
  tablespoon of garlic.  Roll the bread dough out to line the pan.
  
  Lay the dough into the pan, brush with the remaining olive oil,
  sprinkle with the remaining garlic and Italian seasonings, and then
  the fresh herbs. (At this point the bread may be prepared a day ahead
  and kept in the refrigerator, on the prepared pan, to rise.)
  
  Let the dough rise for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Bake in a
  preheated 350 degrees F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden
  brown.
  
  Serves 8 to 12.

      Title: HOMEMADE PECTIN
 Categories: Preserves
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Underripe Granny Smiths,
           Pippins, green apples;
           Washed and cut into eighths
           (do not core or peel)
      2 c  Water for each pound of
           Apples
 
  Place the apples and water in a large stockpot or soup kettle, cover,
  and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes or until
  apples are tender.  Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Pour
  the pulp and juice through a jelly bag or line a large bowl with
  dampened cheesecloth, pour the pulp and juice through, gather the
  corners of the cheesecloth, and tie in a knot.  Suspend from a
  cabinet knob or handle and allow to drip into a bowl overnight. The
  next day, measure the apple juice and pour into a large pot. Bring to
  a boil voer high heat and cook until reduced by half. Refrigerate and
  use within 4 days or pour into containers and freeze for up to 6
  months. An easy way to determine reduction is to measure the depth of
  the liquid in the pan with a plastic ruler before boiling. Re-measure
  as liquid reduces. No need to pour into measuring cup!

      Title: HOMEMADE PIZZA (PINNACLE) (2)
 Categories: Pizza, Cheese/eggs, Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  RECIPES FOLLOW
 
  SEE HOMEMADE PIZZA (1) FLOUR THE SURFACE YOU WILL USE TO ROLL OUT THE
  DOUGH. YOU CAN NOT USE TOO MUCH FLOUR. USING A ROLLING PIN, ROLL
  DOUGH TO ABOUT 13 - 14" CIRCLE. IT MIGHT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE BUT CAN BE
  DONE. PLACE THE ROLLED OUT CRUST ON A GREASED PAN. USE YOUR FINGER
  TIPS TO PRESS THE DOUGH TO THE PAN. TRIM OFF EXCESS DOUGH FROM AROUND
  THE EDGES AND PUT IT WITH THE REMAINING DOUGH. THICK CRUST: START
  WITH A BALL OF DOUGH SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN A BASEBALL. PLACE THE DOUGH
  IN THE CENTER OF THE GREASED PIZZA PAN AND WITH YOUR HANDS, PUSH AND
  SPREAD THE DOUGH UNTIL IT COVERS THE ENTIRE PAN. DO NOT PUT THE
  TOPPINGS ON TO HEAVILY UNTIL YOU GET THE FEEL FOR FLAVOR. COOKING THE
  PIZZA: THE BEST TEMPERATURE TO COOK THE PIZZA AT IS AROUND 475 F. IT
  ONLY TAKES ABOUT 12 -14 MINUTES TO COOK A PIZZA SO KEEP A CLOSE EYE
  ON YOUR MASTERPIECE. AFTER THE PIZZA HAS COOKED FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES
  YOU ARE READY TO TEST THE CRUST FOR DONENESS. DO THIS BY LIFTING THE
  EDGE WITH A SPATULA. IF THE PIZZA SLIDES IN THE PAN WHEN YOU SHAKE
  IT, YOU ARE READY FOR THE LAST STEP. REMOVE THE PIZZA FROM THE OVEN
  AND PLACE THINLY SLICED MOZZARELLA CHEESE ON TOP. SLIDE THE PIZZA OFF
  THE PAN ONTO THE OVEN RACK. COOK FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. YOU NOW HAVE A
  PIZZA WITH A GOLDEN BROWN CRUST AND CRISP.
      ****************   TIPS FOR PIZZA MAKERS ******************* FOR
  THE DOUGH: 1. USE A HEAVY GLASS BOWL RINSED WITH WARM WATER TO LET
  THE DOUGH RISE. 2. YOU CAN USE THE DOUGH WITHOUT RISING IF YOU ARE IN
  A HURRY. 3. TRY PUTTING SMALL AMOUNTS OF SPICE IN THE DOUGH WHILE
  MIXING IT UP. 4. YOU CAN USE WHOLE WHEAT OR RYE FLOUR IN PLACE OF ALL
  PURPOSE FOR A
     DIFFERENT TASTE. 5. YOU CAN ADD CHEESE TO THE FLOUR TO MAKE A
  TASTEY DOUGH. 6. DON'T THROW OUT LEFT OVER DOUGH, IT WILL KEEP IN THE
  REFRIGERATOR FOR
     MORE TWO WEEKS. MAKE SURE YOU STORE IT IN A LARGE BAG AS IT WILL
  RISE
     SOME. WHEN YOU ARE READY TO USE THE DOUGH LET IT WARM SOME FIRST.
  THE SAUCE: 1. IF THE OIL RISES TO THE TOP WHILE COOKING, SIMPLY STIR
  IT BACK IN WHEN
     COOKING IS FINISHED. 2. YOU CAN USE THE SAUCE WHILE IT IS STILL
  HOT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET IT
     COOL FIRST. 3. THE SAUCE CAN BE KEPT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR UP TO
  ONE WEEK. TO KEEP
     IT LONGER, FREEZE IT! 4. A MIXTURE OF 1 TABLESPOON FLOUR AND 14/
  CUP WATER WILL SPEED UP
     THICKENING PROCESS. 5. TO INCREASE THE YIELD OR CHANGE THE FLAVOR
  OF THE SAUCE, YOU CAN ADD
     ANY CANNED PIZZA SAUCE TO THE RECIPES ABOVE. 6. USE CRUSHED SPICES
  IN ALL THE RECIPES RATHER THAN POWDERED. 7. YOU GROUND, DRY ONION OR
  GARLIC INSTEAD OF FRESH. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PACKAGE FOR
  AMOUNTS TO USE. THE FINAL: 1. IF YOU USE SLICED MOZZARELLA CHEESE YOU
  WILL FIND THE SLICE THICKNESS
     VARIES GREATLY. YOU MAY NEED TO PLACE THE CHEESE ON BEFORE YOU
  SLIDE
     THE PIZZA OFF THE PAN, TO KEEP THE CRUST FROM BEING DONE BEFORE THE
     CHEESE MELTS. 2. IF THE CRUST IS DONE AND THE CHEESE IS NOT MELTED,
  SLIDE THE PIZZA BACK
     ONTO THE PAN. 3. IF THE PIZZA IS TO SOFT WHEN YOU SLIDE IT OFF THE
  PAN, YOU DID NOT USE
     ENOUGH FLOUR. USE MORE NEXT TIME. 4. IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOPPED
  CHEESE LEFT OVER, FREEZE IT AS IT MOLDS FASTER
     AFTER BEING GRATED. 5. USE LEFT OVER SAUCE IN ANY ITALIAN DISH
  CALLING FOR TOMATO TYPE SAUCE.
     OR YOU MAY SAVE IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR A GOOD MIDNIGHT PIZZA
  SNACK.
   *********************  FOR A FAST PIZZA
  ***************************** YOU CAN MAKE A FAST PIZZA BY USING
  TORTILLAS, EITHER CORN OR FLOUR. EVERYTHING ELSE REMAINS THE SAME.
  ALL INGREDIENTS GO ON TOGETHER ON A TORTILLA CRUST PIZZA AS THEY COOK
  VERY FAST. BE SURE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THEM WHILE COOKING. YOU
  STILL WANT TO SLIDE THE PIZZA'S OFF THE PAN BEFORE THEY ARE DONE TO
  CRISP UP THE CRUST. IT IS CERTAINLY HOPED THAT YOU WILL ENJOY THE
  RECIPES ABOVE AND HAVE FUN MAKING HOMEMADE PIZZA'S FOR YOUR FAMILY.

      5 lb Pork
           , (not too lean, or
           You'll have door-stops!)
      1    Clove garlic, or to taste
      2 tb Salt
      1 tb Pepper
      1 tb Morton Sausage Seasoning
 
  Grind pork coarsely. Mix ground pork with other ingredients. Extrude
  thru meat grinder on coarse setting again into natural casing,
  twisting at desired link size. Freezes well, and is very aromatic. I
  recommend multiplying recipe times 5 and make an afternoon of it, if
  you're going to pull out the meat grinder anyway. To cook, simply
  thaw and pan-fry in skillet for approximately 15 minutes on medium
  heat until sausage is nicely browned and begins to 'split', or use in
  your favorite recipe.

      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      7 ea Medium Potatoes
      1 x  Vegetable Oil or melted Vege
      1 x  Salt, if desired
 
   Scrub 6 to 7 medium potatoes (about 2 pounds) under cold running
  water and peel, if desired.  Slice the potatoes as thinly as
  possible, (thin enough to see through). As you proceed, place the
  slices in a bowl of cold water to remove the starch.  The water will
  turn white. Drain and refill the bowl, repeating this until the water
  remains clear. Drain and let the potatoes dry.
   Fill a heavy skillet or saucepan halfway with vegetable oil or melted
  vegetable shortening and cook over medium heat until the oil crackles.
  Place the potato slice into the hot oil, a few at a time being
  careful not to overcrowd the pan.  When the potatoes are brown on
  both sides, 4 to 6 minutes, remove from the pan and drain on paper
  towels. Sprinkle with salt, if desired.
   Makes about 180 chips, or enough for about 3 cups of dip.

  Homemade powdered sugar.   Put 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 rounded
  tablespoon of cornstarch into the blender and process it at medium
  speed. Whirl it a while, turn it off, push down the sugar from sides
  of container, give it another whirl till it is fine and powdery.
  There is a difference in blenders, some make very smooth powdered
  sugar that can be used in frostings. In some blenders there may be
  some graininess and this can be used in any recipe that is baked, or
  can be sprinkled on cookies and cakes..

      Title: HOMEMADE RED CHILE POTATO CHIPS
 Categories: Potatoes, Southwest
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------CHIPS--------------------------------
      2    To 3 (about 1 lb) Idaho
           - baking potatoes
      1 qt To 2 quarts peanut or
           - canola oil, for frying

MMMMM-----------------------CHIP SEASONING----------------------------
    1/2 ts Pure red chile powder
    1/2 ts Cayenne chile powder
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Note: Idaho russet baking potatoes make the best chips, as they are
  high in moisture and low in sugar.
  
  1. Peel and slice the potatoes paper-thin with a mandolin or in a food
  processor. Soak the sliced potatoes in ice-cold water 5 minutes. (You
  can slice the potatoes ahead of time and hold them in water as long
  as 4 or 5 hours.) Drain in a salad spinner or lay flat on kitchen
  towels and pat dry.
  
  2. Heat the oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350 degrees.
  Meanwhile, thoroughly combine all the chip seasoning ingredients in a
  bowl. Fry the potatoes in batches until crisp and brown. Remove with
  a slotted spoon or use a spoon and strainer, and drain on paper
  towels.
  
  3. Transfer to a large bowl and toss chips with chip seasoning while
  still warm.
  
  Serving suggestions: For best results, serve immediately. Good with
  burgers, sandwiches, or with eggs and chorizo for breakfast or brunch.
  Storage: Can be stored in a cool, dry place two to three days, or up
  to one week in dry climates.

      Title: HOMEMADE RICOTTA CHEESE
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Next Page
 
  Unlike most other fresh cheeses - cottage and cream cheese, for
  example - the  curd  of  this bland, light cheese is formed by the
  direct addition of acid to the milk, not by fermentation; the time
  required to make it is generally short.  If you haven't used this
  Italian favorite before, try it in place of cottage cheese, as well
  as in Italian recipes for such dishes as lasagne and manicotti.
       For a pleasant light milk dessert, sweeten ricotta slightly/ top
  with a sprinkling of grated chocolate or cinnamon. 1- 2 qts regular
  milk, 3 tbsp distilled white vinegar OR 1/4 cup strained fresh lemon
  juice, Salt, if desired. Pour the milk into a heavy stainless-steel
  or enameled saucepan and stir in the vinegar or lemon juice; set the
  pot over very low heat and bring the milk very slowly to a simmer  (
  200F on a thermometer).  There will be fine beads around the edge of
  the milk, which will look foamy but will not appear to be boiling;
  remove the pot from the heat and set it, covered, in a spot where the
  temperature will remain fairly uniform; between 80 and 100 degrees;
  (an unheated oven, without a pilot light, is a good spot) let the
  milk stand for about 6 hours or until a solid curd floats above the
  liquid (the whey); more or less time  may  be required, depending on
  the temperature of the environment and the characteristics of the
  milk; line a fine sieve with doubled dampened cheesecloth (or better,
  two layers of very fine-meshed nylon curtain netting, dampened) and
  set it over a bowl; dump the curds and whey into the sieve and allow
  the whey to drain off until the ricotta is yogurtlike; if you want a
  firmer cheese, tie the corners of the cloth to form a bag and hang it
  up to drain further; (in warm weather, the draining might  be
  completed in the refrigerator; when the texture of the cheese is to
  your liking, add a little salt (from 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon) if you
  wish; store the cheese, covered, in the refrigerator; it will be at
  its best after it  has chilled for 24 hours, and it will keep well
  for 4 or 5 days. Makes about 1 pound.

           Stephen Ceideburg
      4 lb Ripe, red tomatoes, peeled,
           -seeded and chopped
      2 c  Chopped red onions
      4    Green onions, minced
      1 tb Garlic, minced
    1/2 c  Apple cider vinegar
      6    To 8 jalapeno chiles, cored,
           -seeded, minced
      4    To 6 serrano chiles, minced
      1 tb To 2 tb New Mexican red
           -chile powder
    1/2 ts Crushed cumin
  1 1/2 ts Crushed dried oregano
      1 ts To 2 ts salt
      1 c  Crushed Pomi tomatoes (see
           -note)
    1/2 c  Minced cilantro
 
  When I was working on this recipe many years ago, I bought about 20
  bottled salsas, from mild to fiery, to try in the name of research. I
  tasted them all. The one trait most of them shared was salt in great
  amounts. By making your own salsa, you can season it to suit your
  taste. Also, it's fun to vary the recipe by adding a variety of
  chiles and spices.
  
  Combine the fresh tomatoes, red and green onions, the garlic and
  vinegar in a 5-quart saute pan; simmer for 10 minutes to reduce some
  of the tomato liquid. Add the chiles, chile powder, cumin, oregano,
  salt and crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat
  and stir in the cilantro.
  
  Store in a glass jar in the refrigerator or freeze in 1-cup batches.
  
  Makes about 1 quart.
  
  Note: Crushed Pomi tomatoes, sold in vacuum-packed boxes, help pull
  the salsa together and thicken the juices.

      Title: HOMEMADE SAUERKRAUT
 Categories: New text im, Cooking rig
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
       15 lb (6-8 Firm Heads) Green
  :          Cabbage
      3/4 c  Kosher Or Pickling Salt
  
  Wash the cabbage thoroughly and trim away any bruised or damaged
  leaves. Quarter and cut away the core and discard. With a food
  processor, mandoline or knife, cut the cabbage into uniformly fine
  shreds. In a large plastic tub, place half the cabbage and sprinkle
  with half the salt. Mix and "massage" the cabbage and then let it
  stand for 5-10 minutes. Juices will begin to come out of the cabbage.
  Place this in your fermenting tub. Repeat this process with remaining
  cabbage and salt and pack into tub.
  
  The cabbage must be covered by juices to prevent spoilage. If there
  is not enough juice to cover, make up some additional brine by adding
  4 tablespoons salt to 2 quarts water, pouring over just to cover.
  
  Be sure to keep cabbage submerged during fermentation. Cover tub
  securely with plastic wrap and then cover that with a clean towel to
  keep out any errant contamination.
  
  Store in a 65-75 degree room and don't uncover for at least 3 weeks.
  Remove towel and plastic wrap. There should be no bubbles of CO2 gas
  evident in the brine (gently tap tub to check). If there is, recover
  and check again in 2-3 days.
  
  The finished sauerkraut should have a clean appearance with no white
  spots or unpleasant or off odors. Texture should be firm.
  
  Pack finished sauerkraut into clean jars and store in refrigerator
  for up to 6 months.
  
  Yield: Approximately 6-8 quarts

  * or dry white wine or vodka. put thin cut strip steak or chicken
  parts (especially huge quantities of wings) in marinade and soak
  overnight. Best if grilled on the BBQ, but can be baked (usual meat
  350 F for an hour a lb.) For the truly lazy (we prefer to think of
  ourselves as the "time-challenged", Italian dressing on a (cheap)
  steak adds more variety to the flavor.  I can't verify any
  tenderizing qualities, though. NOTES: The only marinade I've seen
  that tenderizes the meat is a homemade Teriyaki recipe a college
  roommate from Hawaii used. I think it was the high alcohol content.

      Title: HOMEMADE TOMATO SAUCE
 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8    1-pint canning jars
     15 lb Tomatoes
      2 c  Chopped onions
      1 c  Green bell peppers --
           Chopped
      1 c  Celery -- diced
      2 tb Brown sugar
      2    Garlic cloves -- minced
      1 tb Fresh parsley -- minced
      1 tb Fresh basil
      1 tb Oregano
  1 1/2 tb Non-iodized salt -- * see
           Note
    1/2 ts Black pepper
 
  * Kosher salt is the best to use for canning.
  
  1. Prepare jars following manufacturer's directions for sterilizing.
  2. Use 12-15 pound of fresh, ripe tomatoes. If you want them peeled,
  dip in boiling water briefly until skins split. Rinse in cold water.
  Remove cores and any green spots. To reduce cooking time, chop
  tomatoes. Put into a large, heavy pan. It is very important to use a
  heavy pan to prevent tomatoes from sticking and scorching. Simmer the
  tomatoes for 2 hours, stirring frequently. 3. Add the remaining
  ingredients and simmer overnight or until the sauce has cooked down
  by half. To prevent sauce from sticking, fill a large roasting pan
  with the sauce, set it in a 250-degree oven, and let it cook until it
  is as thick as you want it; stir occasionally as it cooks. The sauce
  will not stick using this method. If you want a smooth sauce, or if
  you have not peeled the tomatoes, you can sieve the sauce or use a
  blender or food processor to make it smooth. 4. When sauce is the
  consistency you desire, pour it into hot jars, leaving 1/4-inch of
  head space. Adjust lids. Process in a pressure canner with 10 pounds
  pressure, 20 minutes for pints, 25 for quarts.
  
  Yield: 8 pints.
  
  NOTE: See "Tomato Jam" in this cookbook if you make this using a
  boiling water bath instead of a pressure canner. Omit the onion,
  green peppers and celery if using water bath; 45 minutes in a boiling
  water bath is then sufficient. You can freeze this sauce, including
  the onion, green pepper and celery if you prefer. This recipe is
  given using all three methods of preserving this sauce because many
  people are going back to the old ways of canning produce. If
  freezing, freeze in proportions to use all at one time in a recipe.
  Usually 1 quart of sauce will make a recipe for 4 to 6 people.

  Just mix it all together and freeze it according to your freezer
  instructions.
  
  This is for a gallon freezer so you will have to cut it in half for a
  smaller freezer. You have to allow for expansion while it freezing so
  don't fill the container too full.
  
  If we are not going to be eating this right away I have found if I
  add a small container of Cool Whip to it it keeps it from forming ice
  crystals when we put it in cantainers to store in the freezer.
  Usuallly we make it when we have family over and don't have too much
  left.

      3 c  Water
      1 pk Prunes 12 oz.
      3 tb Unbleached lecithin
    1/4 ts Citric Acid
 
  1. Cover prunes with water and bring to a boil. Cool. 2. Blend prunes,
  water, lecithin, and citric acid in blender 'til smooth. 3. Pour in
  clean quart jar and refrigerate. Should keep up to 30 days.
     Can be frozen.
  
  Use as a fat and egg substitute for cooking, baking and salad
  dressings. According to the directions on the jar of the commercial
  Wonderslim, 1/4 cup of WonderSlim replaces 1/2 cup of butter, oil or
  margarine. Personally, I prefer using almost equal amounts. 1/4 cup
  equal approximately 35 calories.

  2 1/2 lb Corned beef brisket
 
  Place brisket and water in Dutch oven;  cover tightly and cook 1 hour
  at 350  degrees (F).  (  It is very important to simmer the meat
  slowly because boiling will cause meat to become tough.) Turn brisket
  over and continue cooking,  covered,  1  1/2  to  2 hours, or until
  meat is tender. Remove brisket  from cooking liquid and place,
  flat-side up, on rack in broiler  pan  so surface of meat is 3 to 4
  inches from heat. Combine honey with 1 tablespoon mustard;  brush
  half of mixture over top of brisket and broil 3 minutes. Brush with
  remaining mixture and continue broiling 2 minutes,  or until  brisket
  is glazed. Meanwhile, steam cabbage 15 to 20 minutes,  or until
  tender. Combine remaining mustard with butter and dill; spread over
  hot cabbage wedges.  Carve brisket diagonally across the grain into
  thin slices and serve with cabbage.

      Title: HONEY
 Categories: Info, Db
      Yield: 1 Info
 
      1 x  Honey
 
  How to substitute honey: You can substitute honey for equal amounts of
  sugar in many recipes.  In baked goods, sub. honey for up to half the
  sugar and make the following adjustments; 1. Reduce the amount of
  liquid in the recipe by 1/4 Cup for each cup of honey used. 2. Add
  1/2 tsp. baking soda for each cup of honey used. 3. Reduce oven
  temperature by 25.

      Title: HONEY "CRACKER JACKS"
 Categories: Snacks
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Honey
    1/2 c  Margarine
      6 c  Popped popcorn
      1 c  Shelled peanuts
 
  Heat honey and margarine in a saucepan until well blended. Cool.
  Combine popcorn and peanuts in a large bowl. Pour honey mix over
  popcorn, stirring as you pour. When popcorn and peanuts are well
  coated, spread in a pan in a single layer. Bake at 350 degrees for 5
  to 10 minutes or until crisp but not brown, stirring several times.
  The difference between crisp (not brown) and burnt can be a matter of
  minutes. Keep in an air tight container.
  
  My Note:  This doesn't really taste like cracker jacks but it was sure
  good.  I'll use more popcorn next time as the popcorn really soaked
  the honey butter up fast and some was positively soggy.

    1/4 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Heavy or whipping cream
      1 ts Lemon juice
      1 ds Hot pepper sauce
      1 ts Chives;fresh chopped
 
  "Matchless recipes stem from unlikely places. This recipe was
  uncovered in a "bed-and-breakfast" establishment not far from
  Nashville, Tennessee ... When the meal was praised to the heavens,
  the owner admitted the recipe was not exactly her own. Her
  grandmother brough a honey-baked chicken as part of dowry when she
  sailed from Scotland to America in the late nineteenth century. In
  the intervening years, she altered her chicken to its present
  sensational rendition. After I ate extra portions for two days, she
  generously donated the recipe."
  
  Place the chicken in a shallow glass dish or ceramic bowl. Combine the
  honey with the vinegar and pour over the chicken, turning the pieces
  to coat with the mixture. Let stand, covered, 2 hours. Saute the
  bacon in a 12-15 inch cast iron skillet till crisp. Drain on paper
  towels. Crumble and set aside. Add the vegetable shortening to the
  bacon drippings. Heat over medium-low heat until hot. Meanwhile,
  remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and pat dry. Combine the
  flours, with the salt and pepper to taste on a plate. Coat the
  chicken pieces well with the flour mixture. Set aside 1 Tbsp of the
  flour mixture. Gently place the floured chicken skin side down in the
  hot grease. Slowly fry the chicken pieces until crisp and the juices
  run yellow when pricked with a fork, about 20 minutes on each side.
  Preheat the oven to 375F. Drain the chicken pieces on a paper bag and
  place on a shallow heatproof serving platter. Place in the oven 12 to
  15 minutes. Meanwhile, discard all but 1 Tbsp drippings from the
  skillet. Stir in the reserved 1 Tbsp floure mixture. Cook, stirring
  constantly, 2 minutes. Whisk in the chicken stock and cream, scraping
  the sides and the bottom of the skillet. Cook over medium heat until
  thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in the lemon
  juice and hot pepper sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the
  chives. Spoon some of the gravy over the chicken pieces and sprinkle
  with the reserved bacon. Pass the remaining gravy on the side.

           Brown sugar filling
 
  Chop almonds. Note, that other nuts can be substituted. Crumble yeast
  if in cake form) or packets and add into warm water and stir until
  dissolved. Stir in brown sugar and honey. Stir in eggs, salt, melted
  butter, orange rind and buttermilk (or sour milk). Mix all flours
  with all but 2 tablespoons of nuts; stir into liquid mixture. Let
  this very soft dough rest for 10 minutes. Scrape dough onto board or
  pastry cloth dusted with about 1/2 cup of additional all-purpose
  flour. Knead for about 5 minutes, working in flour on the board,
  until dough is elastic but still soft and tender. Place dough in
  greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place
  about 2 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. (A turned off oven with
  the light on is a good place.) Turn dough onto floured board again;
  gently pat into a 12x10 inch rectangle. Sprinkle Brown sugar filling
  over dough and roll up from the 10 inch side. Fold two ends under to
  make a ball-shaped loaf and place on a greased baking sheet. Brush
  with melted butter. Fold a 36 inch piece of foil to make a 2 inch
  wide strip 36 inches long. Fasten with paper clips into a ring and
  set ring around the dough. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let
  rise in a warm oven until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Sprinkle
  loaf with remaining chopped nuts, (and some butter and brown sugar if
  you like) and bake at 350F for 1 hour or until golden brown. Makes
  one 3 3/4 pound loaf. Cut into halves or quarters and freeze
  separately, if you like. BROWN SUGAR FILLING: Mix 1/2 cup brown
  sugar, packed, with 1 Tablespoon cinnamon and 2 Tablespoons wheat
  germ. I also add some finely chopped nuts.

      Title: HONEY BAKED HAM
 Categories: Pork, Meats, Wine
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           -CAROLE ROCK (TSTW72B)
      1    Smoked ready-to-eat ham,
           -13 to 15 pounds
      2    To 3 bottles gingerale
      3 c  Dry white wine
           GLAZE:
      5 tb Dijon mustard
    1/3 c  Honey
    1/3 c  Real maple syrup
           SAUCE:
  1 1/4 c  Chicken stock
      3 tb Real maple syrup
      2 tb Dijon mustard
      2 ts Cornstarch
 
  Remove the rind and score with diagonal cross-cuts. Put ham in a close
  fitting kettle and cover with gingerale. Bring to boil, then simmer
  for 20 to 30 minutes. This step removes the too salty taste and adds
  a delicate flavor. Drain the gingerale, add ham to a roasting pan and
  pour the wine over it.  Cover with foil and bake at 350~ for 1 hour.
  
  Combine the glaze ingredients.  After the ham has baked 1 hour, brush
  the ham with the glaze, using all of the mixture. Return ham to oven
  (uncovered) and bake an additional 1-1/2 hours, or until internal temp
  reaches 140~.  Baste occasionally after the glaze has "set", about 45
  minutes.  If the glaze gets too dark before the temp gets to 140
  degrees, tent the ham with foil.
  
  When ham is done, transfer it to a serving plate and loosely cover
  with foil to keep warm.  Skim the fat from the juices, reserving all
  the juice and caramelized bits from the glaze. Heat this to a boil
  along with 1 cup of the chicken stock (reserving 1/4 cup), syrup and
  mustard. Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/4 cup of reserved chicken stock
  and whisk it into the sauce to thicken.  The sauce should be a rich
  dark color. Strain and pour into a gravy boat.  Serve the sauce over
  the ham.
  
  NOTE *** In step 1, "close fitting kettle" means the tightest fitting
  kettle you can fit the ham into, so it takes less gingerale to cover
  it.

      Title: HONEY BARBECUED CHICKEN
 Categories: Barbecue
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           BASTING SAUCE:
      6 tb Honey, 8 tb if necessary
      3 tb Tarragon or white wine
           Vinegar
      1 ts Curry powder
      1 ts Dried tarragon
      2 x  Chickens, each 3 lbs
           Salt and pepper
 
  In bowl, combine honey, vinegar, curry powder and tarragon. Remove
  grids from barbecue. Place one or two shallow drip pans - filled with
  water or stock (you can also add a splash of white wine on the lava
  rocks. Preheat barbecue to high setting. Arrange chickens on spit,
  making sure they are evenly balanced. Brush with honey basting sauce
  and install rotisserie on barbecue with drip pans directly
  underneath. Barbecue at high setting for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to
  medium and roast chickens, with lid down, for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours,
   basting every 30 minutes with sauce, until thermometer inserted in
  thickest part of thigh registers 185'F. Remove from barbecue, season
   with salt and pepper, and tent with foil. Let stand 10 minutes
  before   carving. Serves six to eight. INDIRECT COOKING METHOD FOR
  GAS BARBECUES WITH TWO BURNERS: Place a shallow metal or foil pan
  (not necessary to add water)  under one side of grill to catch
  drippings. Preheat both sides of barbecue on high setting. Tie wings
  and legs of chicken with string; brush lightly with oil. Place
  chicken breast-side down on hot grill and cook for two minutes. Turn
  chichen on its side and grill for two minutes. (A long-handled spoon
  inserted in cavity makes it easy to turn). Turn on back and grill for
  two minutes; continue to grill chicken on other side for two minutes
  until browned all over. Place chicken, breast-side up, on the side of
   barbecue with drip pan underneath; turn off burner on that side.
   Brush liberally with sauce and roast chicken with lid down for about
   90 minutes, brushing occasionally with sauce, until chicken is done.
   (Indirect heat from other side of barbecue will cook the chicken).
  This method also works well with beef, pork, or lamb roasts. IF YOU
  HAVE A CHARCOAL BARBECUE WITH A LID: Move the hot coals to the sides
  of barbecue and place a drip pan in centre. Place chichen or roast on
  grill with drip pan dirctly underneath. Cook with lid down and use a
  meat thermometer to gauge when foods are cooked.

  Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F)
  
  Beat butter and sugar with orange rind until creamy. Gradually add
  oil and continue beating until mixture is very light and fluffy. Stir
  in flour alternately with orange juice. Knead dough lightly with
  hands for
        1    minute.
  
  Take a scant tablespoon of dough and flatten it a little. Place a
  teaspoon of the nut filling in the centre and fold dough over to
  enclose filling.
  
  Shape into ovals, pinching ends to a point.  Decorate tops with tines
  of fork or by crimping cookies diagonally across top in four rows
  with special crimper (see NOTE), or leave them plain.
  
  Place on lightly greased baking trays and bake in a moderate oven for
  20-25 minutes until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.
  
  Dip in boiling syrup, four at a time, turning cookies once. Leave in
  syrup 10 seconds in all, longer if well-soaked cookies are preferred.
  Lift out onto a plate and leave until cool.
  
  (If no nut filling is used, sprinkle tops with crushed walnuts or
  toasted sesame seeds and cinnamon.  Only those which are to be served
  should be dipped; store remainder in an airtight container and dip
  when required.
  
  TO MAKE NUT FILLING: Thin honey down with orange juice and blend into
  remaining ingredients.
  
  TO MAKE HONEY SYRUP: Place ingredients in a heavy-based saucepan and
  stir over heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to the boil and boil over
  moderately high heat for 10 minutes and skim.  Let syrup boil on a
  moderate heat while dipping cookies.  Add a little water to syrup
  when it thickens too much during dipping.
  
  NOTE: Icing crimpers will be familiar to many pastrycooks and cake
  decorators who work with icing. If you don't own a crimper (or have
  never seen one), have the family handyman cut a piece of tin or
  aluminium plate about 2.5 x 10 cm (1 x 4 inches). Bend metal in half
  over a thin rod and cut 6 to 8 evenly spaced saw-like teeth on the
  narrow edges. Curl the "teeth" slightly inwards.

      Title: HONEY GARLIC DRESSING
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      3 ea Egg yolks
      4 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Paprika
      1 tb Crushed black pepper
  1 1/2 tb Salt
      1 tb Fresh purred garlic
    1/2 c  Honey
    3/4 c  Tarragon
    3/4 c  Red wine vinegar
 
  In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Slowly add the oil while
  whisking to make a basic mayonnaise.  It will work only if you add
  the oil very, very slowly at first. You can also use a food processor
  to make this dressing, but again, you must add the oil ever so slowly
  to get the desired consistency. Once the mayonnaise is made, add all
  the ingredients except the vinegars. Make sure the the dressing is
  well mixed and ingredients are evenly distributed throughout. Slowly
  stir in the tarragon vinegar and then the red wine vinegar, making
  sure that they are evenly blended. This dressing must be stored in
  the fridge or it will spoil. Yield 5 cups

 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    1/2 c  Butter
      2 c  Graham flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      2 tb Brown sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
    1/4 c  Honey
      1    Egg, beaten
    1/4 c  Water, hot
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Using a pastry blender or two knives,
  cut butter into flour until mixture has the texture of cornmeal. Stir
  in baking powder, brown sugar and cinnamon. Add egg and hot water and
  mix until well blended.
  
  Knead dough 2 or 3 minutes.  Set half aside.  Roll out into a square
  about 1/8 inch thick. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Score dough
  into about 2-inch squares, using a sharp knife. Bake at 350 degrees
  F. for 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Roll out and bake
  remaining half of dough. Cool baked crackers and gently separate into
  squares.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  North American crackers with graham flour, honey and cinnamon -- I
  originally got this recipe from a newspaper and played around a bit
  until I thought it tasted like Sunshine Honey Grahams. I've
  occasionally used ordinary whole wheat flour when I didn't have any
  graham flour and it still worked alright.  Graham flour is coarser.
  Yield: Makes 36-40.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (judgment required).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: HONEY GRAHAMS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Turbinado sugar (regular
           Sugar can be substituted)
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
      8 tb (1 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    1/4 c  Honey
    1/2 c  Warm water
 
  "These are slightly sweet crackers with a wonderful wheaty flavor. The
  crystalline turbinado sugar gives them a unique crunchiness. Perfect
  in a lunch bag or as an after-school snack, they are best next to a
  tall glass of cold milk. 375~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to
  375~F.
  
  Mix together the flours, sugar, salt, baking powder, and cinnamon in a
  large bowl or in the food processor. Cut the butter into these dry
  ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Dissolve the
  honey in the warm water. Add this honey-water mixture to the flour
  mixture and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll the dough out to about 3/16 inch thick.
  With a sharp knife, cut into 2- by 3-inch rectangles. Prick each one
  all the way though in 3 or 4 places with the tines of a fork.
  
  Place the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
  sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Turn and bake an additional 10 to 15
  minutes, or until light brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 35-40.
  
  VARIATIONS: Put thin slices of banana or other fruit on top of some

      Title: HONEY INFORMATION
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Information
 
  1.Honey is one of the few food low in pesticidal contamination.
  Contaminated bees die before they reach the hive. Honey is also free
  of preservatives, artificial flavors, colors and will not mold.
  2.Honey will not freeze, so store it almost anywhere in a solid
  container with a tight lid. If crystallized, place honey jar in pan
  of hot water. Don't heat very hot as flavor and nutrition changes
  dramatically. Also,honey that has been diluted with water will
  ferment. 3.Freezing bread with honey used as a sweetening agent is
  not advise,since honey deteriorates when frozen. This can cause
  "mushiness" upon thawing. 4.Always mix honey thoroughly with other
  recipe ingredients before turning mixture into baking pans. This will
  prevent a too moist, over sweetened layer from collecting on the top.
  Make it a rule to combine honey with theliquid ingredients to assure
  complete distribution in the mixture. 5.When using honey is
  substitution for sugar in standard recipes, a general rule is to
  reduce the amount of another liquid ingredient by 1/2 cup for each
  cup of honey used to replace sugar. 6.Honey can generally replace 1/2
  of the required sugar without changing the proportions of the other
  ingredients in the recipe. Honey absorbs and retains moisture, thus
  retarding the drying out and staling of baked goods. This is
  especially important when you want to bake in advance. 7.Be sure to
  keep honey covered. When left uncovered, honey picks up other odors
  and loses its own aroma. Honey is storage usually gets darker in
  color and stronger in flavor, but remains useful as ever. So if you
  plan to store honey it may be better to start out with a light
  colored honey. 8.Pure honey usually becomes granulated as it ages, or
  if stored at cold temperatures.  Granulation is a natural aging
  process and does not affect the honey except for color and flavor. To
  bring granulated honey back to liquid form, simply place the
  container of honey in a pan of warm water until the granules
  disappear. If more heat is required, keep the containuer off the
  bottom of the pan of water, by putting a rack under it, and setting
  the pan over low heat. Be careful not to overheat granulated honey,
  since too much heat causes the honey to change color and flavor. It's
  easier to degranulate smaller amounts of honey.

      1/8 ts cream of tartar
  
  1.  Preheat oven to 325F.  Use parchment to line the bottom of a 10
  inch tube pan, preferably with a removable bottom. Grease the
  parchment. In a large bowl, whisk 1 cup sugar, honey, vanilla, lemon
  extract, and salt into egg yolks. Place bowl in a large pan of hot
  water. With an electric mixer, beat about 5 minutes on medium-high
  speed until pale yellow and doubled in volume. Gently fold in sifted
  flour.
  
  2.  Wash beaters.  In a large bowl, beat egg whites in electric mixer
  on a low speed 1 minute, increasing speed to medium-high. When foamy,
  sprinkle in 1 tablespoon sugar and cream of tartar. Beat until stiff
  but not dry. With a spatula, fold the egg whites in thirds. Pour
  batter into pan. Tap gently on the counter to remove air bubbles.
  
  3.  Bake on middle rack of oven 35 to 45 minutes or until golden
  brown. When done, cake sides will pull away from pan slightly; top
  will be flat and feel spongy when pressed with finger. Cool 20
  minutes. Run a small knife between edge of cake and pan. Remove from
  pan carefully. Pull off parchment and cool completey. Serve or store

  strain the peel and spices out and rebottle. Submitted By

  using. Mix filling in a bowl and set aside. Melt butter in a small
  pan, and return to heat when it cools and doesn't flow easily while
  you are working with filo. Smooth 3 sheets of filo flat on a cutting
  board.  With a pastry brush, dribble warm butter between sheets.
  Sprinkle 2/3 cup of nut filling over top, spreading to corners. Lay
  another 3 sheets of filo over filling, buttering between them.  Fold
  edges over on each side to keep nuts from rolling out.  Starting with
  the end nearest to you, roll away from you as tightly as you can. Cut
  into 1" slices. Place each roll in oiled pan, next to each other,
  snugly, nuts facing upwards. Continue using all the filo and filling.
  When all the slices are in the pan, dribble a teaspoon of warm butter
  on top of each slice.  It will disappear into the layers of nutmeats.
  Bake at 350 F for 45 minutes. Begin making syrup 20 minutes before
  the pastry is ready to be taken out of the oven. Pour hot syrup over
  rolls immediately upon removal from oven. Use a spoon to ladle it
  over each one.  Set aside to absorb syrup for 4 hours.  Do not
  refrigerate.

      Title: HONEY ORANGE BISCOTTI LF
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Dried grated orange rind
    1/3 c  Chopped pecans or currants
           -(optional)
    1/4 c  Fat-free egg substitute plus
      2 tb Fat-free egg substitute
           (can use egg whites)
      2 tb Honey
      2 tb Frozen orange juice concen
           -trate, thawed
 
  1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and
  orange rind and stir to mix well. Add the pecans or currants if
  desired and stir to mix. Add the remaining ingredients and stir just
  until the dough holds together.
  
  2. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape into two 8
  x 2 inch logs. (If the dough is too sticky to handle, knead in a
  little more flour.) Flatten out the logs a little bit or else the
  crust will split and crack. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking
  spray and place the logs on the sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for
  about 23 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer the logs to a
  wire rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
  
  3. Place the logs on a cutting board and use a serrated knife to
  slice the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place the
  slices on a baking sheet and bake at 300 degrees F for 20 minutes or
  until lightly browned, turning after 10 minutes.
  
  4. Transfer the biscotti to wire racks and cool completely. Serve
  immediately or store in an airtight container.
  
  NOTE: These are very easy to make and taste great. I made them
  without the pecans or currants, so there were even less fat and
  calories.

        2 TB brandy
      3/4 c  firmly packed light brown
  :          sugar
      1/4 c  honey plus additional for --
  :          glazing the buns if=
  :          desired
      1/2    stick (1/4 cup) unsalted
  :          butter
      1/2 c  chopped pecans
  :          Cream biscuit dough, recipe
  :          follows
        2 ts cinnamon
  
  In a small bowl let the currants macerate in the brandy and 1/4 cup
  hot water for 20 minutes, or until they are softened, and drain them.
  In a saucepan heat 1/4 cup of the brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey, and
  butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until the sugar is melted.
  Pour the mixture into an 8 1/2-inch round cake pan, and sprinkle the
  pecans over it. Roll the dough into an 18- by 10-inch rectangle on a
  lightly floured surface,=7F force the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar
  through a coarse sieve evenly over the dough, and sprinkle the
  cinnamon and currants over the brown sugar. Beginning with a long
  side roll up the dough tightly, jelly-roll fashion. Cut it into
  1-inch slices with a sharp knife, and fit the slices cut side up in
  one layer in the pan, pressing them down gently. Bake the buns in a
  pre-heated 425 degree F oven for 20 minutes, or until a tester
  inserted in the dough comes out clean. Run a thin knife around the
  edge of the pan, invert the buns onto a plate, and reinvert them onto
  a platter so that the plain side is up. Brush the top with the
  additional honey, heated, if desired. (Or, if you prefer not to use
  the honey glaze, invert the buns directly onto a platter, sticky side
  up.)

  Judi's Notes:  I cut the honey to only 2 tablespoons and did not use
  the salt in this recipe due to my sodium restrictions. Instead I
  added freshly ground pepper to taste and it turned out very well. I
  believe I also used more cinnamon and nutmeg than was called for in
  the recipe.

  *optional - at the mix-in beep [or near the end of kneading if you
  don't have one] we add in a big handful of honey toasted wheat germ -
  don't worry about the amount but do watch the moisture of the dough
  ball - it blends right in and makes it really hearty - and healthy!
  
  Toss it all in the bread maker and enjoy! - You can throw in dried
  fruit later if you like [but not too much!] but we like the wheat
  germ. The bread is super for breakfast, and the sweetness goes with
  most sandwiches too!

  In saucepan, combine milk, butter, honey and salt and stir over med.
  heat until butter melts.  Remove from heat and let cool to warm.
  Meantime, in lge. mixing bowl, combine warm water, yeast and sugar.
  Let "work" until foamy, abt. 10 min.  Beat cooled milk mixture into
  yeast mixture, then beat in whole wheat flour and bran; beat
  thoroughly. Gradually add all-purpose flour until mixture is too
  stiff to beat.
  
  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead in remaining
  flour or as much as needed until dough is smooth and has a light
  sheen.
  
  Note Well:  Properly kneaded dough will NOT stick to surface or hands
  or mixing bowl if using machine fitted with dough hook.
  
  Form dough into ball and place in large lightly oiled or greased
  bowl, and turn once so greased side is up. Cover, place in warm,
  draft-free place & let rise until doubled in bulk, abt. 1 hr. Punch
  down, and turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead
  lightly--just enough to expell any remaining air. Halve dough, cover
  with towell, let rest abt. 10 min.
  
  Form each half of dough into a loaf.  To make pan loaf, roll dough
  into rectangle 1/2" thick and abt. as wide as length of pan. Roll up
  jelly roll fashion pinching closed seam as you roll. Tuck ends under
  and place loaf seam side down in greased loaf pan.  Let rise again
  until doubled in bulk. Place loaves in center of preheated 425 F.
  oven and bake for 15 min. Reduce oven to 350 and continue baking
  until loaves shrink slightly from sides of pan, abt. 20 min. or so.
  Turn loaves from pan, set on oven shelf an bake 5 min. more or until
  a firm rapping on bottom makes hollow sound. Brush tops with melted
  butter and cool on racks.

  tightly at top to allow room for dough to expand. Set bag in bowl and
  let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Divide dough in half. Cut each in half again, then quarter into 4
  equal pieces, about 2 1/2 ounces each. Shape each piece into round
  roll by pinching bottom of dough. Place 2 inches apart on large oiled
  baking sheet, pinched-bottom down. Sprinkle with flour. Drape loosely
  with plastic. Let dough rise in warm place until almost doubled,about
  1 hour. If desired, use kitchen shears to make deep cross-stitch
  slash in rolls.

  oven to 400 degrees F.. Bake until rolls are deeply browned and sound
  hollow when raped on bottom, about 20 minutes. immediately remove
  from pan and place on wire rack. Makes 16 rolls.

  peas to serve on the side.
  
  1. Rinse game hens and pat dry. Place in a bowl. Trim off wing tips,
  necks and any excess fat from the neck cavities.
  
  2. Place garlic and ginger in the bowl of a food processor; process
  until nearly smooth. Reserve.
  
  3. In another bowl, combine soy sauce, honey, peanut oil, orange
  juice and orange zest. Add the reserved garlic and ginger. Pour
  mixture over game hens to coat well.
  
  4. Let rest at room temperature for 4 hours, or refrigerate overnight,
  turning game hens in marinade 3 or 4 times.
  
  5. Preheat oven to 350'F. Place game hens in a shallow roasting pan
  to fit. Pour marinade on top.
  
  6. Bake game hens 1 hour or until cooked through, basting every 15
  minutes.
  
  7. Remove hens to a serving platter. Pour cooking juices into a small,
  heavy saucepan and boil over high heat for 5 minutes or until sauce
  thickens slightly. Pour over the hens just before serving.
  
  NOTE: These birds can be served whole or, for smaller portions, are
  lovely split in half. Just be sure to remove the backbones and wing
  tips before preparing.

    1/4 ts Black pepper
      2 ts Tub-style margarine; canola
           -or corn oil
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      1 cl Garlic; minced
  1 1/4 c  Chicken broth; defatted and
           -divided
      2 tb Mild honey
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Salt; or to taste optional
  1 1/2 c  Cauliflower florets
      1 lg Carrot; peeled and thinly
           -sliced
    1/4 c  ;water
      1 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Dijon-style mustard
  1 1/4 c  Long-grain white rice
           -uncooked
 
  Cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon
  salt, if desired, and pepper.  In large nonstick, spray- coated
  skillet, cook chicken pieces over medium heat, turning frequently
  with large wooden or plastic spoon, 7-10 minutes or until they begin
  to brown and are cooked through.  Remove and set aside in medium
  bowl. In same skillet, combine margarine, onion, garlic, and 3
  tablespoons broth. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, 6-7
  minutes or until onion is tender. If liquid begins to evaporate, add
  a bit more broth. Add honey and lemon juice to pan with onions, and
  stir to combine well. Stir in remaining chicken broth and salt, if
  desired. Stir in reserved chicken, cauliflower, and carrot. Bring to
  a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until flavors
  are blended.  Meanwhile, cook rice according to package directions.
  
  Combine water and cornstarch.  Stir into simmering sauce and cook,
  stirring, until thickened.  Stir in mustard. Simmer an additional 1
  or 2 minutes. Arrange rice on large serving platter. Top with chicken
  and sauce. Or serve individual portions over rice.
  
  Judi's Notes:  I have not tried this dish but cooking cauliflower for
  20 minutes is just too long.  I would advise 10 minutes tops to keep
  it's bright color and not become mushy.

      6 tb Mayonnaise
      1 tb Dijon mustard
      1 tb Onion; finely minced
      2 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
           Pinch of salt
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil;olive & peanut
 
  Heat vinegar and honey in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring
  until honey dissolves (or use microwave). Pour into bowl and cool.
  Whisk in mayonnaise, mustard, onion, parsley and salt. Gradually
  whisk in oil. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.
  Bring to room temperature before using.)
  
  NOTE: I usually make 2/3 batch.  Needs more salt than indicated above
  ~ about 1/4 tsp for the 2/3 batch. Best to consider parsley for the
  full batch to be about 1 1/2 tbs instead of the 2 indicated above.
  This is nice with a spinach/mushroom salad.

      Title: HONEY-ORANGE LAMB
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
    3/4 c  Pinot noir (Burgundy)
    1/4 c  Orange juice
           -(juice of 1 orange)
      2 tb Lemon juice (juice
           -of 1 lemon)
      2 tb Honey
      1 ts Mustard, dry
      1 c  Tomato puree
           -(puree of 1 tomato)
      3    Garlic cloves
           -(or more to taste)
    1/4 ts Black pepper, ground
      1    Half leg of lamb,
           -butterflied
 
  Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb. Place the lamb
  in a bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade (a glass
  9x13 pan works well). Pour the marinade over the lamb. Cover and
  marinate in the refrigerator for 12 hours, turning occasionally.
  
  Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm but not flaming.
  Place lamb on grill about 3-4 inches from the coals. Cook 20 minutes
  on each side.
  
  After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness.
  Contrary to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but
  should still be a little pink. When done, slice thin and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- This recipe is the same as Anita
  Cochran's recipe for grilled butterflied leg of lamb, except that it
  uses a different marinade.  I got the marinade recipe from a local
  wine merchant. Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  This marinade also works well with chicken.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes
  cooking. : Precision:  no need to measure.

  about 5 min.; add flour if necessary to prevent dough from sticking.
  Roll dough out into a 12x15 inch rectangle; spread orange-nut filling
  evenly over dough. Starting with the long side, roll up jelly-roll
  fashion. Cut across roll into 15 slices about 1 inch each and
  arrange, cut-side-up in a well greased 9 by 13 inch baking pan.
  Cover and let rise until almost double, about 45 minutes.
  
  Bake in a 350^ oven for 35 minutes or until browned on top. Transfer
  rolls to a serving board; quickly scrape out any syrup in pan and
  spread it over rolls.  Serve them warm or reheated in a 350^ oven,
  lightly covered with foil, for about 20 minutes.  Makes 15 rolls.

 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      2    Roasting chickens; (3-1/2
           -to 4 lbs each)
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter or margarine
           -(1 stick)
    1/2 c  Yellow onion; finely chopped
      2 lg Garlic cloves; finely
           -chopped
    1/2 c  Dijon-style mustard
    1/2 c  Mild honey
    1/4 c  Dried currants
      2 tb Peach or mango chutney;
           -finely chopped
      1 ts Mild curry powder
      1 ts Salt; optional
 
  Remove the chicken backs and reserve (freeze) to make stock. Cut each
  chicken into 8 serving pieces.  Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry
  with paper towel.
  
  In a 1-1/2 to 2-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high
  heat. Cook the onion and garlic for 3 to 5 minutes, or until
  softened. Add the remaining ingredients except the chicken and stir
  until combined.
  
  Dip each piece of chicken in the honey mixture, coating the chicken
  completely.  Place the chicken pieces, skin side up, in a shallow
  baking pan.  Spoon the remaining sauce over the chicken.
  
  Place the baking pan in a cold oven and set the temperature at 400
  degrees F.  Bake for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is cooked
  through. (If your baking pan will not accommodate all the pieces,
  divide them between 2 baking pans, position the oven racks in the
  upper and lower third of the oven, and switch the pans halfway
  through baking.) Transfer the chicken to a warmed serving platter.
  You may serve it hot, at room temperature, or slightly chilled.
  
  Tips for Leftovers:  In addition to reheating well, this chicken
  makes a fabulous chicken salad.  Just remove the skin and tear the
  meat into bite-size pieces. Add some coarsely chopped Golden
  Delicious apples (no need to remove the peel), coarsely chopped
  toasted almonds, dried currants, and minced scallions. Make a
  dressing with mayonnaise, some Dijon-style mustard, and a touch of
  honey. Toss the chicken with just enough dressing to bind, and season
  with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Serve with a green
  salad and some crusty rolls and you've got yourself a tasty lunch or
  a light supper.  Source:  Lauren Groveman's Cooking School,

      Title: HONEY-WALNUT PRAWNS
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Walnuts
      5 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
      2 c  Oil
     16 md Prawns, peeled and cleaned
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Egg whites
      2 tb Honey
      3 tb Mayonnaise
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/2 tb Condensed milk
    1/2 c  Oil
 
  Here's a goody.  I normally shy away from Western influenced Chinese
  recipes and would never have fixed this one on my own. It calls for
  such non-Chinese things as milk and mayonnaise. My room mate fixed it
  the other night though, and it was excellent.  He was trying to
  duplicate a dish that he and his date had at a Chinese place a while
  back and apparently, this is almost it.  Laurie suggested it would be
  closer to the restaurant dish by just dusting the shrimp with
  cornstarch rather than making a batter. I imagine that it would be
  good either way. It certainly is good this way!
  
  Rinse walnuts, then boil in 5 cups water, continually changing water
  until clear.  When clear, boil with sugar until sugar dissolves. Heat
  2 cups oil until almost smoking, then deep-fry walnuts until they're
  shiny and brown, no longer golden.  Remove walnuts to cookie sheet,
  let cool. Mix cornstarch and egg whites together to form a thick,
  sticky texture and mix well with prawns.  Set aside.  Mix honey,
  mayonnaise, lemon juice and condensed milk in a medium bowl until
  smooth.
  
  Heat oil until boiling, then deep fry prawns until golden brown.
  
  Drain, then fold in honey-mayonnaise mixture. mix well, sprinkle with
  walnuts, and arrange on platter.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: HONEY~ OAT BREAD 12/10/94
 Categories: Breads, Wip
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      6 c  Bread Flour
      1 c  Quick cooking Oats
      2    Packages Active Dry Yeast
           -2pkg = 4 1/2 ts measurement
      2 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Water
    1/3 c  Honey; or Brown Sugar
    1/4 c  Butter; melted
      2 lg Egg; beaten slightly

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1 tb Water; mix with egg
      1    Egg White
      2 tb Oat Bran for top.....
           -options: are sesame seed,
           -or rolled oats or nothing
 
   In a large bowl, stir together water and Brown Sugar or Honey.
  Sprinkle with Yeast and stir until it has dissolved. Stir in Oats.
  Let the mixture stand for 15 minutes to let the Oat flour mix absorb
  liquid. Do all in a KitchenAid mixer if available. Add oil or butter
  and eggs. Mix very well. Stir in Salt. I like to let the sponge mix a
  few minutes before I add the salt.
   One cup at a time, mix in flour until the dough becomes too
  difficult to stir. Turn out on to a "well floured" work surface and
  knead until smooth and elastic, adding flour only as necessary to
  keep from sticking, about 8 minutes. It takes 4 or 5 minutes on the
  KitchenAid. This recipe usually takes 6 full cups of flour.
   This is the place where I freeze 1/2 of this bread....To Freeze:
  place the 1/2 recipe of this dough into an oiled labeled gallon
  plastic freezer bag. Squeeze all of the air out of the bag and seal
  tightly. Freeze at once. To use; defrost several hours until dough
  rises to double its frozen bulk, then proceed...
   Proceed with the half recipe of dough.
   Place the dough in a large well oiled bowl. I spray the used
  KitchenAid Bowl with non-stick  and throw the dough back in, spray
  the top of the dough as well. Cover with plastic wrap, or a moist
  towel. Let the dough rise in a warm draft free place.
   Check the rise at 45 minutes, the "perfect place" rises this bread
  in 45 minutes.
   Punch dough down. If you are doing this entire recipe, divide the
  dough in half. Shape each half into a loaf. This also makes a nice
  round loaf with a crunchy crust.....
   Pan Loaf making: beginning at one narrow end, tightly roll up the
  dough to form a loaf. Pinch seam edge into dough to seal. Lightly oil
  a loaf pan.
   Meanwhile, place oven rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat
  to 375 degrees F. Place each loaf in a prepared 8 1/2" X 4 1/2" X 2
  1/2" loaf pan, seam side down. Cover, let it rise in a warm place
  free from drafts, until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes . Check the
  rise at 35 minutes, the "perfect place" rises this bread in the pan,
  in 35 minutes.
   This is the place where I make decorative slits into the top of the
  loaf.
   In a small bowl, whisk egg white with one tb of water. Brush a
  little of the egg white mixture over the top of the loaf and sprinkle
  with 2 tb Oat Bran, or sesame seeds just before placing in the oven.
   Bake for 35 minutes on a baking stone or 40 minutes in the bread pan.
   To make the crust even crustier, spray the top of the loaf with
  water, and liberally spray the inside of the over at 5 minute
  intervals and/or place a water filled pie pan in the oven on a lower
  rack than the bread. (boiling water added to the pie pan just before
  baking makes sure you have steam....) Makes one or two loaves, each
  about 18, 1/2" slices.

    1/2 oz Dried Tangerine Peel
           -=OR=- citrus peel
      3 lb Firm, white-fleshed Fish

  SOAK THE TANGERINE or citrus peel for 20 minutes in warm water or
  until it is soft. Rinse under running water, squeeze out any excess
  liquid, finely chop and set aside. Make 3 or 4 slashes on each side
  of the fish to help it cook faster and allow the flavors to permeate.
  Rub the fish on both sides with the salt. Sprinkle the cornstarch
  evenly on each side of the fish. Heat a wok or deep saute pan until
  it is hot. Add the oil. When hot, deep-fry the fish on each side for
  5 to 8 minutes until brown and crispy. Remove fish and drain on paper
  towels. Pour off oil, leaving 2 tablespoons. Reheat the wok. Add
  chopped tangerine peel, garlic, ginger and scallions and stir-fry for
  30 seconds. Put in the rest of the ingredients. Return the fish to
  the wok, spooning the ingredients over the top of the fish. Cover
  wok. Cook over low heat for 8 minutes. Serve at once. Serves 4, as
  part of a Chinese meal or 2, as a single dish.

 Categories: Cheese, Seasonings, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           16 to 20 poke sprouts
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 ts Salt
           Black pepper; to taste
    1/2 c  Mild Cheddar cheese; grated
     12 sl Crisp-fried bacon or
      4 sl Canadian bacon
      4    Squares buttered toast or
      4    English muffins
           -- buttered and toasted
      1 tb Chives; chopped
 
  Gather poke sprouts in the early spring when they are 6 to 8 inches
  tall, snapping off the entire stalk with its unfurling leaves above
  the ground, as you would pick asparagus.
  
  Clean the poke sprouts and boil them gently in salted water to cover,
  until the stalks are just tender. Drain sprouts and keep them warm
  until served.
  
  While poke sprouts are cooking, make a white sauce of the butter,
  flour, milk, salt, and pepper.  As the sauce thickens, stir in the
  Cheddar cheese; continue cooking until cheese is blended.
  
  Have ready and keep warm the slices of bacon, drained well, and the
  buttered toast.
  
  For each serving, top a toasted bread slice with 3 slices of bacon
  and put 4 or 5 poke sprouts on top. Cover the poke sprouts with
  cheese sauce and sprinkle with chopped chives.
  
  Note:  Poke sprouts can be forced indoors in a flat in wintertime. In
  late autumn, dig the roots of at least two dozen pokeweed plants.
  Chop off each large root about six inches from the crown and plant in
  a large, earth-filled box with the crown portions barely covered.
  Take the box indoors to the cellar after freezing weather has set in,
  and keep it watered.  Or place in a garage or on a porch where the
  temperature does not go below freezing, and invert a cardboard box
  over the top. In a few weeks, each crown will produce several crops
  of blanched poke sprouts which can be cut for use as soon as they
  have reached a height of about eight inches. Do not let the sprouts
  grow tall enough to develop purple coloring in the stalks. After the
  sprouts are cut, another crop will grow.
  
  Use the sprouts in recipes calling for asparagus. Dandelions and
  chicory can be forced by the same method. The blanched greens are
  very tender and mild.

MMMMM------------------------THE FILLING-----------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
    3/4 c  Pet or Carnation evap.
           - milk
    1/2 c  Crisco
      1 c  Sugar, granulated
      1 tb Vanilla

MMMMM--------------------------THE CAKE-------------------------------
      3    Eggs, large
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Milk, whole
    1/2 c  Butter
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
  3 1/2 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Flour, all-purpose
 
  The Filling:
  
  Cream the butter 5 minutes, medium speed. Add Crisco a little at a
  time. Cream another 3 or 4 minutes. Add the sugar a little at a time
  while continuing to beat. Then add the milk, mixed first with the
  vanilla, beating and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl
  frequently. The longer you beat this the better it becomes.
  
  The Cake:
  
  Preheat oven to 350. Grease two 8-inch-square cake pans or baking
  dishes, or use a 13x9x2-inch pan. Beat 1 minute after each addition.
  Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes (40-45
  minutes for an oblong pan) or until you can insert a toothpick and it
  comes out clean. Cool the cake in pan on a rack. It's best to use the
  cake for Twinkles when it is slightly frozen - about 30 minutes in
  the freezer. Then cut them into 1-1/2 by 3-1/2 inch bars. Put bottom
  side of each bar up on waxed paper. Spread half of the bars with the
  filling and put together with an unfrosted bar, sandwich style.
  Refrigerates up to 2 weeks, freezes up to 1 year.

      Title: HOPKINS NEOLITHIC EGG NOG
 Categories: Drinks, Holiday, Alcohol
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     12    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Sugar
     12    Egg yolks
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      4 c  Heavy cream, beaten
      4 c  Milk
      4 c  Bourbon
      1 c  Dark rum
           -e.g., Myers's Rum
 
  Beat whites stiff; beat in about 1/2 cup sugar.
  
  Beat yolks until very light with about 1 cup sugar and the salt.
  Combine and stir until thoroughly blended. Add cream, then milk, then
  Bourbon. Beat well.  Add rum. Store in a cold cellar for a week.
  
  Serve with freshly-grated nutmeg.  The egg nog should be ladled from
  the bottom of the bowl, and never stirred, in order to maintain its
  layered quality.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional layered eggnog with bourbon and dark rum -- This is
  the egg nog that was served at the Hopkins Neolithic Xmas Party, a
  party that some friends used to have every year. We now serve it for
  our Winter Solstice celebration. It's purported to come from the
  original "Fanny Farmer Cookbook." Yield: Serves 15-20, inebriates 6.
  
  *  An alternate method, preferred by some, is to make a creamy,
  non-layered egg nog by stirring gently every day.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5-10 minutes preparation; 1 week aging.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

  for 15 minutes, covered.  Allow the dish to rest off the heat for 10
  minutes before you lift the lid.
  
  This dish looks like a normal starch dish, but the name is
  intriguing. In the South it is served as often as you wish, but
  always on New Year's Day, in which case it is to bring you good luck.
  I am told that the children were so fond of this dish in the old days
  that they would hop about the kitchen waiting for it to cook thus
  giving it the name.
  
  It can be made with black-eyed peas, red lentils, or dried field
  peas, but the remaining ingredients are always constant.

      Title: HOPPIN'JOHN - NEW STYLE
 Categories: Vegetarian, Southern, Low-fat, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Black-eyed Peas, cooked
    1/2 c  Rice, white or brown
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Celery, chopped
    1/2 c  Onion, chopped, or
    1/4 c  Green pepper, chopped
           4-5 green spring onions, chp
      4 oz Mushrooms, sliced, canned
      2 ts Poultry Seasoning
      4    Tomatoes, crushed
    1/2 ts Red pepper, crushed (opt)
 
  Directions: Combine ingredients in a stockpot or crockpot, and cook
  until rice is done, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. A little more liquid
  may have to be added. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking as the
  mixture thickens whichever method is used. In crockpot, cook about 4
  hours on high, and 6-7 hours on low heat.
  
  Cook's Note:  In any authentic Southern cookbook, there will almost
  always be a recipe for Hoppin' John, which is basically a combination
  of rice and black- eyed peas. To this basic recipe, each cook will
  add his/her personal touches and I have added mine. White rice is
  traditional, but brown rice has more fiber. Tomatoes are optional.
  Mushrooms are a modern touch. In some areas, red pepper sauce or
  tabasco sauce replaces the crushed red pepper.  In Texas, Purple Hull
  peas are frequently used, with Picante Sauce served on the side. In
  Louisiana, Red Beans and Rice are the popular combination. In other
  places, is found the combination of black beans and rice as the
  popular dish.

      Title: HOPPING JOHN
 Categories: Rice, Pork
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      4    Strips bacon
    1/2 c  Raw rice
    1/4 c  Onion
      2 c  Water
      2 c  Fresh Blackeye Peas
           Salt & Pepper to taste
 
  Dice bacon. Add onion and fry until bacon is crisp. Add peas and
  rice, then water.  Cover and simmer over low heat for about 20
  minutes or until rice is tender. ( I *ALWAYS* add a good sized shake
  or two of Louisiana Hot sauce (NOT Tabasco, there is a difference)
  Yields 10 servings
  
  This is the basic recipe (from Southern Living)  It can be adjusted in
  several ways:
  
  1)  substitute ham hocks for bacon by boiling them in the 2 C water
  until the meat comes off the bone.  Fry onion in bacon grease until
  yellow. Or use any fatty pork meat: trimmings from a roast or chops,
  "fat-back", etc
  
  2)  I prefer Purple-Hull Peas over the Black-eyes, But if you don't
  know the difference (or can't find them) it's not a big deal. It is
  important to use fresh peas, frozen if you have to...if you can only
  get canned or dried peas, nevermind and fix something else.
  
  3)  I discovered a secret to Southern style cooking: Cavender's Greek
  Seasoning.  Put a little of it in everything, along with the
  Louisiana Hot Sauce makes everything taste better. This is what I
  would do for the greens as a regular family dinner.  Later I'll get
  out the company recipe.
  
  BTW  Southern Living is *the* Soutern magazine and has the best
  recipes for regional favorites.  They also put out an annual cookbook
  which includes all the recipes for the year. If I keep osting them
  here y'all see that this book is a very worthwhile purchase.

    1/2 lb Frozen black-eyed peas
     10 oz Bag frozen mustard greens

  This is a variation of something my grandmother used to make with h*m
  hocks. It's a long way from the original. This makes approx. 5 qts.,
  enough to freeze half or feed a crowd.
  
  Put the water in the cooker, turn burner to high. Stir in spices.
  Rinse rices and put in cooker.  Throw in black-eyed peas, greens, and
  stewed tomatoes. Bring to simmer with the top off, stirring
  occasionally, until frozen stuff has thawed somewhat and greens are
  separated. Lock the lid down, bring to high pressure. Cook at high
  pressure for 30 minutes, remove from heat and allow natural pressure
  release. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Tobasco sauce is a must on
  the table.
  
  I use an 8-qt.cooker, cut recipe in half if you use a smaller cooker.

      Title: HORCHATA DE ARROZ - COLD RICE DRINK
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 c  Rice
      1    Piece (2 inches) true
           -(Ceylon) cinnamon stick or
      1    Piece (1 inch) U.S.
           -"cinnamon" (see editor's
           -note)
      2 c  Boiling water
      5    To 6 cups cold water
    1/2    Lime, juice only
      1 ts Ground true (Ceylon)
           -cinnamon or: *
    1/2 ts Ground U.S. "cinnamon" (see
           -editor's note)
      3 tb To 4 tb sugar, or to taste
 
  * preferably fresh ground in a spice grinder
  
  If you travel to Mexico, you will see many street stands selling only
  fresh cold beverages. Most are made from fresh fruit. This, which
  like the French orgeat must go back to some medieval Mediterranean
  original, is the mysterious white one that you will see in the glass
  jugs. It's one of my favorite drinks. My son Rodrigo always begs me
  to make this refreshing drink, which is still a favorite remedy for
  children with digestive upsets.
  
  Place the rice and cinnamon stick in a small saucepan. Add the boiling
  water and let soak until the water is white and milky. Bring to a
  boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer,
  uncovered, until partly softened but not fluffed up, about 15
  minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick and let the rice cool, covered.
  Working in several batches, purse the rice mixture in a blender or
  food mill. The mixture may be sticky and hard to work with; use the
  cold water a little at a time if necessary to thin. With a wooden
  spoon or pusher, force the mixture through a medium-mesh sieve (you
  can use more of the cold water to help rinse it through). Combine the
  strained pursed rice with the lime juice, ground cinnamon, and sugar
  to taste. Add the remaining cold water gradually until the horchata
  is the consistency of a not-too-heavy cream soup (use a little more
  if desired). Taste and add more sugar, lime juice, or cinnamon if
  desired, but the flavor should be delicate and slightly bland. Chill
  thoroughly and serve with ice.
  
  Yield: About 1 1/2 quarts.
  
  Editor's note: Martinez says the U.S. product called cinnamon is not
  the same as the cinnamon, imported from Sri Lanka (Ceylon), that's
  sold in Mexico. The bark is thinner, and it's medium tan, not reddish
  brown. The Sri Lankan type also is known as soft-stick cinnamon. It

      Title: HOREHOUND DROPS
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 c  Fresh horehound leaves
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Corn syrup or honey
 
  Put the horehound in a small nonreactive sauce pan and add the water.
  Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, or 20 minutes. Allow to cool,
  then remove horehound and squeeze out all the liquid. Add the sugar
  and corn syrup or honey to the pan, stir with a wooden spoon while
  bringing to a boil, then turn heat down to a gentle simmer. If
  bubbles threaten to overflow the pan, reduce heat slightly and stir.
  
  Boil to the hard-crack stage.  If you have a candy thermometer, this
  is in the range of 330 F, but even so you'll need to test often
  toward the end of cooking to get the hardness right. Keep a shallow
  cup of cold water nearby. Stir the liquid occasionally, and watch how
  it falls from the spoon. When it forms a thread, begin testing for
  hardness by allowing a drop of the mixture to fall into the cup of
  cold water.  Don't trust your fingers to examine the now-hardened
  drop in the cup; bite it. If it's at all gooey or sticks to your
  teeth, keep cooking. When it's hard enough to crack when you bite it,
  remove the pan from heat immediately.
  
  If the mixture crystallizes, just add a cup of water and an extra
  tablespoon of corn syrup or honey to the pan, scrape all the
  crystalline chunks into it, and begin again.
  
  Lightly butter a candy mold, cookie sheet, or other heatproof baking
  pan, and pour in the hot mixture.  If you're using a flat-bottomed
  pan, score the surface of the candy after it has cooled enough to
  become firm. This will help in breaking it apart, which should be
  done as soon as the candy can be handled.
  
  After individual "drops" are formed, sift granulated sugar or powdered
  sugar over them to keep them from sticking together. Store in a
  moisture-proof container.

 Categories: Vegetables, Salads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lg Bunch of fresh spinach

MMMMM-------------------GOMA (SESAME DRESSING------------------------
      4 tb White sesame seeds
      2 tb Sake (Japanese Rice Wine)
      2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Japanese soy sauce
      1 ts Rice vinegar
 
  This spinach dish is standard fare for a Japanese meal. This dressing
  may also be used with a variety of other green vegetables, so don't
  hesitate to experiment.
  
  IN A SMALL SAUCEPAN, heat and ignite the sake to cook off the alcohol.
  Toast the sesame seeds in a ungreased skillet over medium heat for
  about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Stir occasionally. Put the
  seeds into a suribachi (Japanese mortar) and crush into a paste.
  (This can be ground in a food processor, however you will have to use
  at least twice the amount of sesame seeds.) Add the sake, sugar, soy
  sauce and rice vinegar and blend thoroughly. Remove from the
  suribachi and set aside while preparing the spinach. In a large, tied
  bundle, wash and rinse the spinach in cold water. Drain thoroughly.
  In a wide saucepan, bring about 1 cup water and 1 teaspoon salt to a
  boil. Cook the spinach until the leaves are barely wilted. Remove
  spinach and refresh with cold water. Squeeze dry of excess water.
  Keep the spinach in a bundle and cut off and discard the large stems.
  Cut the spinach into 1-inch pieces. Add the sesame dressing to the
  spinach and mix gently. Divide the spinach between 4 bowls and serve
  at room temperature or chilled. Garnish with extra sesame seeds.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
           -Martha Stewart Hors d'
      2 c  Flour
      1 pn Salt
    3/4 c  Cold, unsalted butter
    1/3 c  Ice water
 
  Combine flour and salt in food processor. Cut butter into small
  pieces and add to flour. Process quickly until resembles coarse meal.
  Add water by droplets, just mixing until dough holds together when
  pressed with fingers---NOT wet or stickey. Remove dough and press
  into a flat round, wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes. To form
  tartlets, you'll need twice as many pans as the quantity of shells
  you want to make. Lightly butter or pam the insides of half the pans.
  Roll out half the pastry on floured board into a round about 1/8"
  thick. Continually move pastry around board, burning over once or
  twice to prevent sticking. Put tartlet pans on pastry and, with a
  sharp knife, cut pastry into pieces slightly larger than pans. Place
  pastry in prepared pans, pressing firmly, and cut off the excess
  pastry with thumb. Press an unbuttered pan into each pastry-lined pan
  to act as a weight during baking. Place shells on baking sheet and
  chill 30 minutes.  Preheat oven to 375. To bake, set another baking
  sheet on top of tartlets. Bake for 10 minutes, until edges begin to
  have color. Remove top baking sheet and liner pans and continue to
  bake until shells are lightly golden---5-7 more minutes. Remove
  shells from pans and cool on racks. Shells can be cooled fully then
  cushioned with wax paper, stacked and stored in an airtight container
  up to three days. Also they can be frozen.  Place unthawed shells in
  a 350 degree oven---don't allow to brown further. Formatted by

  The Int'l Horseradish Festival is held in Collinsville, IL (about 10
  miles east of St. Louis, MO) every May. Sixy percent of the worlds
  horseradish is grown there. It's pretty easy to grow. Why is it Hot?
  Highly volatile oils are released by enzyme activity when the root
  cells are crushed. To grind: Wash & peel dice in small cubes. Process
  in a blender with enough cold water to just cover.  Add 2-3 T. white
  vinegar ane 1/2 t. salt. Process no more than half a blender jar. The
  time you add the vinegar is critical as this determines how hot it
  will be. If you like it hot wait up to 3 minutes to add the vinegar
  as this stops the emzymatic action.

  Carefully turn, then place pan in oven for 7 to 10 minutes, or until
  done to taste.
  
  3. While fish is baking, place spinach in a medium saucepan. The
  spinach leaves should still have water clinging to them; if they
  don't, sprinkle with a few drops. Add salt, cover, and cook over
  medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just wilted, 2 to 3
  minutes. Pour vinegar into a small saucepan and cook over high heat
  until reduced by half, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.
  
  4. Remove fish from oven. Serve each fillet with some of the wilted
  spinach and a spoonful of the reduced vinegar alongside.

      Title: HOT & COLD SHRIMP (GOONG KOB POH)
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 kg Medium size fresh shrimp
      7    Red hot chili
      3    Cloves garlic
      1 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Hot water
      2 tb Lime juice
      1 tb Hot sauce *
      1 tb Chopped coriander
           * (Sriracha or Sambel
           -Lampung) [Sriracha is a
 
  Thai hot sauce, available here, and comes in several varieties++ from
  mildly warm to blisteringly hot. Some of them are quite similar to a
  thick Tabasco sauce which is what I would use for a substitute. S.C.]
  
  Here is a recipe from my new Thai cookbook that is mainly a dip,
  since the shrimp are either grilled or eaten raw with the rest of the
  ingredients. I haven't made this yet, but the dip sounds quite
  similar to the Vietnamese "Nuoc Cham" (which would be good also.)
  
  Peel shrimp, remove the center black line, leave the tail on. Clean
  and drain, arrange on a plate, chill for 2 hours. Pound the chili and
  garlic until fine. Place into a small bowl. Mix sugar, salt and hot
  water and stir until sugar is dissolved.  Pour over pounded chili and
  garlic. Add lime juice and hot sauce, stir and top with chopped
  coriander.
  
  To Serve:  Thread the shrimp onto the sticks.  Cook over charcoal
  until done to satisfaction.  Dip in prepared sauce to taste. It can
  be served raw and cold.

      3    Fresh lovage or celery
           Leaves
      3    Romaine lettuce or Swiss
           Chard leaves -- torn into
           Pieces
      4    Dried cloud ear or shiitake
           Mushrooms
      1    6 inch piece  dried arame,
           Dulse, or tombu seaweed
           (package)
      1 sm Fresh or dried hot red
           Pepper
      2 tb Rice wine vinegar
      1 qt Water
      1 c  Dry white wine
      1 ts Dark sesame oil
    1/2 lb Firm tofu -- cut into
    1/2    -inch
           Pieces
      2 tb Rice or barley miso sauce
           Garlic chive leaves -- for
           Garnish
           Garlic chive flowers -- for
           Garnish
 
  In a large heavy pot, combine all the ingredients above the line.
  Bring to a boil, then cover, lower the heat to medium-low, and simmer
  for
       30    minutes. Remove the mushrooms and slice thinly, discarding
  the tough portions. Strain the broth and return it to the pan. Add
  the tofu and mushrooms and simmer for 5 minutes. Dissolve the miso in
  a small amount of the broth, stir it into the soup, then immediately
  remove the pot from the heat. Garnish with minced garlic chive leaves
  and serve at once.
  
  Substitution for the Chinese garlic chives: 1 clove garlic and twice
  as much volumn of fresh chives.

  NOTES : This recipe makes one Japanese Miso - a seawood and mushroom
  flavored vegetable broth. Strain the broth and return mushrooms to
  pot. Then add tofu, Chinese chives, and agar (a thickener made from
  seaweed). Quick soup:  check the import section of the grocery. Buy 1
  envelop (or box) Japanese Miso with Mushroom. Make according to
  package directions. Taste and add red pepper flakes and a little rice
  vinegar to taste. Add tofu and heat through. The packaged soup
  contains the agar to thicken the broth.  Do add Chinese chive. (I've
  used society garlic - well cleaned.)

      2 c  Defatted reduced-sodium
           -chicken stock
    1/2 lb Oyster mushrooms, trimmed

  dried, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes, drained, or 1/2 tsp.
  grated lime zest
  
  This classic central That dish is traditionally made with shrimp or
  chicken, but we prefer using oyster mushrooms since they are just as
  meaty in texture and yet more subtle in taste. Although it is served
  as a soup course in North American Thai restaurants, it actually
  falls somewhere between a soup and a curry. In Thailand, it is served
  as a condiment to rice, just like any of the other dishes on the
  table.
  
  In a medium-sized saucepan, bring stock to a boil and add mushrooms
  and chilies. Tie lemon grass and lime leaves or zest together in a
  cheesecloth bag and add to the stock mixture. Cook over medium heat
  for about 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender. Reduce heat
  to low and add lime juice and fish sauce. Discard the cheesecloth
  bag. Serve the soup hot, accompanied by steamed rice.

      Title: HOT & SOUR SHRIMP WITH WATERCRESS & WALNU
 Categories: Filipino, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Large uncooked shrimp,
           -peeled, deveined,
           -butterflied
      4 tb Dry Sherry
      1 tb Grated peeled fresh ginger
    1/2 c  Chicken stock or canned
           -broth
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Catsup. [See note. S.C.]
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Rice vinegar or white wine
           -vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Oriental sesame oil
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
      6 tb Peanut oil
      2 tb Chopped walnuts
      3 bn Watercress, trimmed
      2 md Bell peppers, cut into
           -1-inch squares
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      8    Green onions, cut
           -diagonally into
           -1-inch-long pieces
 
  This excellent recipe is a relatively quick and easy dish worthy of
  gracing any restaurant's menu.  My roommate fixed it last night for
  three people. It disappeared almost immediately. Although it says
  that it serves four I'd say that it's about two healthy servings. Or
  maybe that's just because I'm such a glutton. Spinach would be an
  excellent substitution for the watercress that the recipe calls for.
  Any kind of nut could be used instead of walnuts.  And rice of
  course...
  
  A light marinade of Sherry and ginger flavors the shrimp, which are
  stir-fried with ted bell peppers and green onions. Watercress makes a
  colorful bed for the shrimp. Offer lemon iced tea to go with the
  meal. [Or any good beer.  S.C.]
  
  Combine shrimp, 2 tablespoons Sherry and grated ginger in large bowl.
  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Mix remaining 2 tablespoons
  Sherry, chicken stock, soy sauce, catsup, cornstarch, rice vinegar,
  sugar, sesame oil and cayenne pepper in small bowl.
  
  Heat 2 teaspoons peanut oil in wok or heavy large skillet over high
  heat. Add walnuts and stir-fry for 1 minute. Transfer walnuts to
  plate using slotted spoon. Add watercress to wok and stir-fry until
  just wilted, about 1 minute.  Divide watercress among plates. Add 2
  teaspoons peanut oil, bell peppers and garlic to wok and stir-fry for
  1 minute. Add remaining 2 teaspoons peanut oil, shrimp mixture and
  onions and stir- fry for 1 minute. Stir stock mixture, add to wok and
  cook sauce until clear and thick, stirring frequently, 2 minutes.
  
  Spoon sauce and shrimp over watercress.  Sprinkle with walnuts and
  serve.
  
  NOTE:  I used Jufran sauce rather than catsup.  Jufran is a Philippino
  sauce that's looks and tastes much like catsup. It's made from
  bananas and other stuff, however and has a more complex and
  interesting taste. I use it in place of catsup in many recipes as
  well as on hamburgers, hot dogs and corn dogs.  It comes in both mild
  and hot forms. The mild is not too hot++somewhat like a spicy catsup.
  The hot stuff is much hotter, although not intolerably so. If you use
  this, be prudent about how much cayenne you use, at least the first
  time until you can see how they balance out.
  
  Makes four servings; about 265 calories per serving.

           -matchstick shreds
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      5 tb White vinegar
      2 ts Salt, or to taste
      1 tb Peanut oil
    1/4 c  Bamboo shoots, cut into
           -matchstick shreds
      5 c  Chicken stock
      3 tb Cornstarch mixed with 1/4

      2    Eggs lightly beaten
      1 ts White pepper
      1 tb Sesame oil
      2 tb Chopped scallions
      2 tb Chopped fresh coriander
           -leaves
 
  Here's a classic Chinese version.
  
  Put the mushrooms, tree ears and lily buds into a bowl and cover with
  boiling water.  Let stand for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the bean
  curd into strips and set aside.
  
  Combine the pork shreds with the dark soy sauce in a small bowl.
  
  Combine the light soy sauce, vinegar and salt in another bowl. Remove
  the black mushrooms from the soaking liquid, cut off the woody stems
  and discard, then slice the caps thinly and put into a bowl. Drain
  and rinse the tree ears and add them to the mushrooms. Remove the
  lily buds, cut off the woody tips, slice them in two, then pull each
  apart by hand into 2 or 3 shreds and add them to the mushrooms.
  
  Heat the oil in a wok or large pot.  Stir-fry the pork just until it
  changes color.  Add the tree ear mixture and bamboo shoots; cook,
  stirring for 1 minute.  Add the stock and bring to a boil (you may
  have this simmering in a separate pot), and stir in the vinegar
  mixture.
  
  Adjust the seasonings.
  
  Cook for 1 minute then add the bean curd.  When boiling, give the
  cornstarch/water mixture a stir to recombine and stir into the soup.
  Cook until the soup thickens and clears slightly. Turn off the heat
  and slowly swirl in the beaten eggs.  Transfer to a soup tureen,
  sprinkle with the pepper, drizzle in the sesame oil, garnish with the
  scallions and coriander and serve.

      2 c  Water
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Brown sugar

           Worchestersire
           Sauce and season to taste
           Which for me normally
           Requires more than 1

      2 tb Barbecue sauce as the

           Sliced barbecue pork
      1    Cake tofu cut in 1/2" cubes
        x  Watercrest and bamboo shoots
           Sliced (rarely have them on

    1/4 c  Red and green pepper sliced
      2    Spring onions chopped
  1 1/2 ts Corn starch (approx)
 
  In a sauce pan add sweet and sour sauce, water and egg and beat.
  Apply heat and add all other ingredients. As soup nears a boil add
  sufficient corn starch mixture to thicken. Continue to apply heat
  until soup thicken. Do not over cook as it is best when the
  vegetables are still crispy.
  
  If the perspiration is not dripping from your brow can it really be
  called hot and sour soup?

           Hot and Sour Seasoning:
      2 tb Red wine vinegar
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 ts White pepper
      2 ts Hot chili oil, or to taste
      1 tb Sesame oil
 
  * Skinned and, cut into matchstick strips ** or dry sherry. S.C. ***
  Use cornstarch if unavailable. S.C. **** Cut into strips 1/4 inch
  thick and 1 1/2 inches long
  
  There are distinct steps to take in a certain order instead of just
  tossing everything into the stock. Like other Hot and Sour soups, it
  can be made with whatever you have on hand. Ms. Jue does suggest,
  however that the black mushrooms and wood ears are pretty important
  to the taste and should be used if at all possible. If necessary, she
  says, substitute julienned carrot for the lily buds for color and
  texture. Shredded bamboo shoots, green beans and bean sprouts are
  suggested as additions or sub- stitutions. Pork or shrimp can be used
  instead of chicken with out guilt. Toss in a handful of noodles if
  you like too...
  
  In 3 separate bowls, cover black mushrooms, lily buds and wood ears
  with water until soft and pliable, about 30 minutes. Squeeze dry.
  Remove and discard stems from black mushrooms; julienne. Remove and
  discard hard ends of lily buds. Remove and discard any hard clusters
  in centers of wood ears. Roll each wood er into a tight curl, cut
  cross-wise into thin strips. Set aside.
  
  Mix marinade ingredients. Toss with the chicken strips and set aside.
  
  Heat wok over medium-high heat. When hot, add oil and tilt wok to coat
  sides. Add salt, ginger and chicken. Stir-fry for 1 minute or until
  chicken turns white. Remove chicken and set aside.
  
  Increase to high heat. Add black mushrooms, lily buds and wood ears
  to hot oil. Stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce
  and Shao Hsing wine; stir-fry 5 seconds. Add stock and bring to a
  boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 10 minutes. Then bring back to a
  boil. Add water chestnut flour mixture. Stir continuously until
  thickened (about 30 seconds). Remove from heat.
  
  Slowly pour egg into soup in a circular motion while stir- rings
  slowly with chopsticks to from silk like ribbons. Add tofu and
  chicken.
  
  Put ingredients for Hot and Sour Seasoning in a small bowl. Stir once
  or twice; do not over mix. Pour half into a shallow soup tureen.
  Ladle soup over sauce. Scatter green onions on top. Float remaining
  Hot and Sour Seasoning on top of soup. Stir gently.
  
  Serves 4 as a meal in itself.

      Title: HOT & SPICY BANANA CATSUP
 Categories: Condiments, Sauces
      Yield: 7 Cups
 
      1 c  Seedless raisins
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      3 lg Cloves garlic
      1 cn (6 ounces) tomato paste
      8 lg Bananas, very ripe
      4 c  Up to 6 cups water
      1 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
      1 tb Salt
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
      4 ts Allspice; ground
  1 1/2 ts Nutmeg; grated
      1 ts Black pepper; ground
    1/2 ts Cloves; ground
    1/4 c  Dark Jamaican rum
  2 2/3 c  Cider vinegar
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon; ground
 
  Combine raisins, onion, garlic and tomato past in container of food
  processor or electric blender. Whirl until smooth puree, adding a
  little vinegar if necessary to help the pureeing. Pour into large
  heavy or dutch oven. Peel  bananas. Cut into chunks. Puree in food
  processor or blender, adding    vinegar, if necessary, to help
  pureeing. Add to mixture in saucepan. Add remaining vinegar, 4 cups
  water, brown sugar, salt and cayenne; stir to blend. Bring to boiling
  over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Lower heat to medium-low.
  Cook, uncovered, stirring often, for 1-1/4 hours. If mixture becomes
  too thick and threatens to stick, add enough water to just moisten.
  After 1-1/4 hours, add corn syrup, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper
  and cloves. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, 15 minutes. Remove
  from heat. To test for thickness: Spoon catsup on chilled saucer.
  Chill in refrigerator. A fingertip should leave a track when drawn
  through catsup. If catsup has jellied, thin with little extra vinegar
  and water, equal amounts of each. Let catsup cool slightly.
  
  Working in batches, puree in food processor or blender. Or, push
  through fine-mesh sieve. Return puree to rinsed-out saucepan. Taste
  for hotness, adding more cayenne, if you wish. (The flavor will
  become more pronounced after catsup has mellowed, so be cautious
  about adding more.) Meanwhile, wash half-pint or pint or other
  canning jars or bottles, and lids and bands in hot soapy water.
  Rinse. Leave jars in hot water. Place lids and bands in saucepan of
  simmering water. Return catsup to boiling over medium heat, stirring
  constantly. Add rum; stir to combine. Ladle boiling catsup into hot,
  clean canning jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wip jar rims and
  threads clean with clean, damp cloth. Cover jars with hot lids; screw
  on bands firmly. Process jars in boiling water bath for 15 minutes
  (water should cover jars by 1-2 inches). Remove jars from boiling
  water to wire racks to cool. Test for seals. Label, date and store in
  cool, dark place for up to one year. Catsup is ready to serve after
  ripening. Contributor: Peggy Makalondra  (MM format by Roy Olsen)

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           -New Basic's CB
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Celery salt
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Seasoned salt
  1 1/2 c  Mixed unsalted roasted
           -nuts
      1 tb Coarse (kosher) salt
  1 1/2    Cups
 
   1. Preheat oven to 325_F.
  
   2. Melt the butter in a medium-size saucepan over low heat. Add the
  remaining ingredients excepts the nuts and coarse salt. Simmer over
  low heat for several minutes to combine flavors.
  
   3. Add the nuts and stir until evenly coated. Spread on a baking
  sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.
  
   4. Toss the nuts with the coarse salt and let cool. Store in an
  airtight container.
  
   Adding a little spice just before a meal begins is an excellent way
  to stimulate the taste buds and whet the appetite. We love this
  recipe made with one favorite nut or a combination of many. We often
  warm them just a bit in the oven before serving in a ceramic crock,
  an antique basket, or an art deco silver bowl.

      3    Cloves garlic, chopped
      2 tb Rosemary
      1 ts Chopped basil
      1 ts Chopped thyme

      1 tb Paprika
      2 ts Lemon juice
      2 lb Raw shrimp in their shells
           Salt
 
  Shrimp should be of a size to number 30-35 per pound. Melt the butter
  and oil in a flameproof baking dish.
   Add the garlic, herbs, peppers, bay leaves, paprika, and lemon
  juice, and bring to a boil.  Turn the heat down and simmer 10
  minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the dish from the heat and let
  the flavors marry at least 30 minutes.  This hot butter sauce can be
  made a day in advance and refrigerated.
     Preheat the oven to 450F.  Reheat the sauce, add the shrimp, and
  cook over medium heat until the shrimp just turn pink, then bake in
  the oven about 30 minutes more. Taste for seasoning, adding salt if
  necessary. Nathalie Dupree writes of this recipe in her book "New
  Southern Cooking," "Shrimp taste better when cooked in their shells
  because the fat under the shells preserves their flavor and
  tenderness. When the shells are crisp it is a pleasure to eat the
  shrimp with their shells on. This rich butter sauce cries out to be
  sopped up with crusty bread once the shrimp are gone."

 Categories: Mustard, Condiment, Gifts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Dry mustard
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 pn Of salt
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
 
  From Food From the Heartland:
  
  Hot and Sweet Country Mustard
  
  With so many excellent mustards on the market, why make your own?
  Well, mainly because you can't, as far as I know, buy one like this,
  and it's so very good. Mustards like this have been made in the
  Midwest as long as there have been kitchens there.
  
  Combine the dry mustard, flour, sugar and salt, then slowly stir in
  the cider vinegar.  Don't taste it now, because it will be horrible,
  but in 3 to 4 days it will have mellowed and become superb. Keeps
  indefinitely in a cool place.
  
  Makes a bit less than 1 cup

  inches long. 4.  Have the above ingredients, stock, salt, soy sauce,
  pepper, vinegar, cornstarch mixture, egg, sesame seed oil and

  apples, keeping them whole. Cut each one into 4 to 5 thick rings. Mix
  the sugar and cinnamon together and coat the apple rings. Reserve.
  
  MUFFIN: Sift together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. In
  another bowl beat the eggs, add the milk and melted butter. Stir the
  liquid very quickly into the flour mixture - do not beat and do not
  worry about lumps. Speed is essential. Fold in the chopped apples.
  Fill 24 (5in.) greased muffins tins or paper cases, filled to
  one-third, and put one cinnamon apple ring on each muffin.

  "You're ready to invite the gang over for a last-minute party any
  time as long as you can pull this favorite from the freezer and pop
  it in the oven. Watch them go crazy! (Warning: habit forming!)"
  
  drained, or 2 packages (9 ounces each) frozen artichoke hearts,
  thawed 1 drop hot pepper sauce 1 small garlic clove, minced 1 tsp
  lemon juice 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place all the ingredients in a food
  processor and blend until smooth. (If using a blender instead of a
  food processor, stop the machine frequently and scrape down the sides
  of the container with a rubber spatula. First be sure the blades have
  stopped completely. Blend just until mixture is smooth.) Coat a 1-1/2
  quart baking dish with a nonstick vegetable spray and pour in
  mixture. Bake for 30 minutes, until lightly browned. Serve on party
  rye bread.
  
  Note: You can also bake this spread in several small baking dishes.
  After they cool, cover each one with plastic wrap and freeze them for
  later use. When ready to use, thaw, then remove plastic wrap, and

  * spirals or wide ribbons are recommended.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut the eggplant in half, and place cut
  side down on lightly oiled baking sheet. Pierce with fork several
  times, then bake for 40 minutes, until really soft and collapsing.
  When it has cooled, scoop out the insides and puree everything except
  the parsley and pasta in a food processor or blender. Let sit awhile
  to flavors can blend.
  
  Bring several quarts of water to a boil and cook pasta al dente. While
  pasta is cooking, gently heat the sauce. Drain the pasta and mix with
  the sauce. Garnish with fresh parsley (you can also put parmesan on
  this, it sounds really weird but is good - it's also good without
  it!).

    450 ml Tarragon vinegar
    2/3 l  Bacon grease
    225 ml Lemon juice
    450 g  Sugar
    225 ml White wine
     50 g  Corn starch
     50 g  Pesto
    1/3 kg Chopped crisp bacon
 
  1.  Combine the vinegar, bacon drippings, lemon juice and sugar in a
  sauce pot and bring to a strong boil.
  
  2.  Dissolve the corn starch in the wine, then add to the boiling
  mixture.
  
  3.  Throw in the bacon pieces and the pesto AFTER the dressing has
  cooled completely. Chilled this should last a number of weeks.
  
  Author's Notes: This is off the top of my head so...
  
  At the Italian restaurant where I learned this recipe we didn't put
  the bacon or pesto in until the time of preperation. Heat an amount
  of the dressing in a pan. Pour 151 rum on the spinach leaves and
  light. Extinguish the flames with the warmed dressing.

 Categories: Appetizers, Cocktail, Cheese, Breads, Do ahead

      8 sl Bacon; cooked; crumbled
    1/3 c  Mayonnaise
      1 c  Shredded sharp Cheddar
           Cheese
      1 sm Onion; grated
      1    Egg; lightly beaten
           Freshly ground pepper
    1/8 ts Dry mustard
    1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
           Several dashes Tabasco sauce
      8 sl Firm white day-old bread
 
  Cook bacon by placing on a rack over a shallow pan and bake at 350
  degrees for about 20 minutes, or until crisp. Drain on paper towels
  and set aside.
  
  Combine all ingredients except bread in a bowl. Crumble bacon and add
  to mixture; set aside.
  
  Cut crusts from bread slices and toast on both sides. Spread each
  slice generously with cheese mixture; then cut each slice into three
  long strips. Sprinkle with paprika; place on baking sheet, cover with
  waxed paper and refrigerate.  This may be done the day before. Remove
  from refrigerator 30 minutes before ready to bake; bake at 350
  degrees for about 20 minutes, or until light brown and puffy.  Serve
  hot. Double the recipe for a cocktail party of 20.
  
  Note:  These strips are quite filling.  For a daintier appetizer, cut
  strips in half before baking.  These are delicious nd versatile,
  providing a good luncheon or brunch dish. They should be served with
  sliced tomatoes and garnished with parsley clusters; in which case,
  serve two whole bread slices per person, not cutting into strips. MM

      Title: HOT CHICKEN WINGS
 Categories: Cajun, Appetizers, Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Chicken wings
      1 x  Oil for frying (optional)
      6 oz Hot sauce or Tabasco
    1/2 c  Melted butter
 
  Cut the chicken wings in two at the joints.  In a large frying pan or
  skillet; heat to 360F enough oil (or shortening) to cover the chicken
  wings.  Add the wings and fry until crisp, about 12-15 minutes.
     To bake, preheat the oven to 450F.  Spread the chicken wings out
  on a baking sheet in one layer and bake 45 minutes.
     To make the sauce, combine the Hot Sauce or Tabasco and melted
  butter and blend thoroughly.  As soon as the chicken wings are
  cooked, douse with the sauce, and serve immediately.
     Serves 2-6 Nathalie Dupree's "New Southern Cooking" Nathalie says,
  "These little wings make a good meal for two or are a great
  appetizer. Up North, they are called Buffalo wings and are served
  with celery and blue-cheese dressing.  The little wing tips should be
  trimmed off to make neater pieces.  But I cook them along with the
  wings and save them for myself.  I call them the "cook's treat." You
  may fry or bake the wings, depending on dietary considerations.

 Categories: Poultry, Marinades, Sauce, Appetizers, Kwc
      Yield: 28 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------MIX AND SET ASIDE--------------------------
      1 qt Texas Pete Hot Sauce
      1 c  Soy Sauce
      1 tb Granulated Onion
      2 ts Granulated Garlic
      2 ts Thyme Leaves
  1 1/2 tb Crushed Red Pepper Flakes

MMMMM----------------------ADD TO THE ABOVE---------------------------
     28 ea Chicken Wings(split)
 
  Mix all the spices and Texas Pete.  Then clean and split the chicken
  wings. Pour the sauce over and bake in oven for 1 hour at 300
  degrees. Then remove the chicken from the sauce and place on rack
  above a paper lined sheet tray. Return to oven and cook until chicken
  has a dry like appearance. Then baste with sauce and return to oven.
  Repeat this step until sauce is used up.  When half the sauce is used
  try a wing and see if it is the flavor you want.  (This half way
  point will smack your mouth and finish with a mild slow burn.  This
  is what I call "red fire" appearance.) If wanting the real thing
  continue until sauce is gone. The ckicken will have what I call a"
  black fire" appearance.  This point in the process will grab your
  lips and attempt to rip them off and then finish off with a pleasant
  medium hot slow burn. Enjoy it.
  
  You may want to try marinating them in the sauce overnight then
  cooking off.  It could only get better doing them this way.
  Note-11-15-96 I tried it marinating over night and it gives a full
  deeper flavor. It didn't seem to be as hot this way.  I like both
  ways.
  
  This was in the making over a 5 1/2 year period.  This is it the real
  thing.  Hot chicken wings without the buffalo. This is a limited
  edition of wings; one taste and you will limit who you give them to
  or eat all of them yourself.
  
  Please do enjoy them and share them.

      Title: HOT CHILE OIL "CHINA MOON"
 Categories: Condiments, China
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
    2/3 c  Chile Flakes, dried red
           -shockingly pungent
    1/3 c  Beans, Black fermented
           - Chinese; coarsely chopped
           -(do not rinse them)
      4 lg Garlic cloves
           - peeled and smashed
      2 tb Ginger, fresh minced
  2 1/3 c  Oil, Corn or Peanut
    1/3 c  Oil, Sesame, Japanese
 
  Combine all ingredients in a heavy, non aluminum 2 to 2 1/2 quart
  saucepan. Rest a deep-fry thermometer on the rim of the pot. Over
  moderately low heat, bring the mixture to a bubbly 225 degrees to 250
  degrees, stirring occasionally. Let simmer for 15 minutes, checking
  to ensure the temperature does not rise. Remove from the heat and let
  stand until cool or overnight.
  
  Scrape the oil and solids into an impeccably clean glass or plastic
  container. Store at room temperature.
  
  Use the oil wherever you want to light a spark.  The "goop" that
  settles to the bottom is a wonderful spicy addition to sauces,
  noodles, fillings and marinades.
  
  The day I made my own hot chile oil, I swear I grew a foot as a cook!
  Not at all difficult and eminently satisfying, I recommend this
  recipe to any aspiring cook. Like grinding and brewing your own
  coffee after a lackluster life of instant, the sheer flavor and
  freshness of this chile oil will knock your socks off.

  4 1/2 oz Green Chiles; chopped
    1/2 c  Salsa
      8 oz Monterey Jack Cheese;
           -shredded
 
  Place all dough ingredients except cilantro in pan. Program for knead
  and first rise. Program a kitchen timer to go off 10 minutes before
  the end of the machine's second kneading cycle. Check the dough when
  timer goes off and adjust with flour or water if needed. Add the
  cilantro. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. When dough
  is finished transfer to lightly greased work surface.
  
  Divide the dough in half.  Working with one half at a time, roll it
  into a 15 x 10" rectangle.  Transfer the rectangle to a lightly
  greased cookie sheet.  Visually divide the rectangle into thirds,
  each 10 x 5". Working on the middle third of the dough, and leaving
  1" of space at each end, layer on half the beans, half the olives,
  half the chilies, half the salsa and then half the cheese.
  
  Using a rolling pizza wheel or a sharp knife, make 6 evenly space 5"
  long cuts in the dough, cutting from the edge of one side of the
  unfilled sides just to where the filling starts. Repeat with the
  other unfilled side. Fold the small piece of dough at each end of the
  filling, tucking them underneath the dough on the opposite side.
  Repeat the entire process with the other piece of dough. Tent the
  twists with lightly greased plastic wrap and set them aside to rise
  for 1 hour, or until they're noticeably puffy. Bake the twists in a
  preheated 375F oven for 30 minutes. Remove the twists from the oven,
  transfer them to a wire rack, and allow them to cool for 10 minutes
  before cutting.

  This chili-red soup is exceptionally hot.  It is said that the time to
  serve it is in the hottest months, when the perspirationit induces
  has a cooling effect on the diner. It is equally effective ammunition
  against winter cold.
  
  Cut the beef into cubes and place in a saucepan with the water. Bring
  to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1-1/2 to 2
  hours until the meat is falling apart.
  
  Mix the chili powder with the sesame oil.  Trim and shred the green
  onions. Heat the chili powder and sesame oil in a pan and fry the
  green onions with the garlic for 2 minutes. Add the sesame seeds,
  sugar, pepper and soy sauce and fry for 2 to 3 minutes over medium
  heat.
  
  Lift out the meat, drain well and toss in the pan for a few minutes.

      2 tb Sesame Oil
     12    Green Onions
      2 ts Crushed Garlic
      1 tb White Sesame Seeds, Toasted
           - And Ground
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts White Pepper
  1 1/2 tb Dark Soy Sauce
 
  This chili-red soup is exceptionally hot.  It is said that the time to
  serve it is in the hottest months, when the perspiration it induces
  has a cooling effect on the diner. It is equally effective ammunition
  against winter cold.
  
  Cut the beef into cubes and place in a saucepan with the water. Bring
  to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1-1/2 to 2
  hours until the meat is falling apart.
  
  Mix the chili powder with the sesame oil.  Trim and shred the green
  onions. Heat the chili powder and sesame oil in a pan and fry the
  green onions with the garlic for 2 minutes. Add the sesame seeds,
  sugar, pepper and soy sauce and fry for 2 to 3 minutes over medium
  heat.
  
  Lift out the meat, drain well and toss in the pan for a few minutes.
  Return the contents of the pan to the stock and bring to a boil,
  simmering until the soup is well flavored.

 Categories: Beverage, Chocolate, Larousse
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
      1 oz (generous) good sweet
           -chocolate; broken to pieces
           Small quantity of milk; or
           -water
      2 tb To 3 tbsp water or milk;
           -boiling
      1 c  Milk or water; boiling
 
  Original title: Chocolat.
  
     A generous ounce (40 grams) of good sweet chocolate is needed for a
  breakfast cup.  Put the chocolate broken up into pieces with a small
  quantity of water or hot milk in a casserole on a gentle heat. Cover
  the pan, let the chocolate soften, remove from the fire and whip into
  a smooth paste with a whip or wooden spoon; add first of all two or
  three tablespoons of boiling liquid (water or milk) to dilute the
  paste, then the rest of the liquid, still boiling, continuing to stir
  all the time. To retain the full aroma of the chocolate (the same
  applies to cocoa) it must never be allowed to boil.
  
  Gabi's notes: (1) Excellent with Mexican chocolate, such as Ibarra.
  (2) I got good results using cold milk, added gradually to the hot
  mixture until fully incorporated, then heated to warm (don't allow it
  to boil). I use a wooden hand whisk.

      Title: HOT CHOCOLATE - NSVHOL
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 pt Milk
      3 oz Imported chocolate (milk
           -chocolate or semi-sweet)
 
  Pour 1/4 cup of the milk into a small, thick-bottomed pot. Break the
  chocolate into small bits and add to the milk in the pot. Over very
  low heat, let the chocolate melt, then pour in the rest of the milk,
  bit by bit, whisking well with each addition.  When the chocolate is
  melted and the milk faintly steaming, remove from the heat, beat
  vigorously with a whisk until frothy, and serve.
  
  Variations: A small amount of chocolate-based liqueur, such as
  Cheri-Suisse, Vandermint, or Droste Bittersweet is liked by some. Of
  course, unsweetened baking chocolate can be used instead. Use the same
  proportion: 1 1/2 oz. chocolate per cup of milk and sweeten to taste.

      Title: HOT COCOA POWDERED MIX
 Categories: Beverages, Holiday, Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------FORMATTED BY JULIE LEWIS-----------------------
      1    20 oz. container non-dairy
           -coffee creamer
      1    2 pound package nestles
           -quick choc. drink mix
      1 c  Powdered sugar
      1    Bag miniature marshmallows
           -(optional)
      1    Pkg. nonfat powdered milk
           -which yields 8-10 quarts
 
  Mix all ingredients in a very large bowl and store in air tight
  container. I mix mine in a Tupperware fix - n - mix bowl and just
  store it in that. To serve, just heat water on the stove or in a mug
  in the microwave. Also, the marshmallows will dry out and become
  hard. That's fine - afterall, the ones in the commercial brands are
  hard as little rocks!!! Use as much as you want to suit your own
  taste. When I first received this recipe back in the early 80's
  someone had taken the time to figure out that a serving of commercial
  brand cocoa mix cost about 23 cents a serving while this recipe costs
  about 7 cents.  Also, GENERICS WORK FINE in this recipe which will
  save you even more.

      Title: HOT CRANBERRY KISSEL
 Categories: Jams
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Lemon
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
    3/4 c  Water
     12 oz Fresh or frozen cranberries
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  Kissel is a saucelike Russian dessert, usually made with one or more
  red fruits (berries or plums) and often containing red wine. It is
  wonderful with pancakes and waffles, and even better with a spoonful
  of sour cream or yogurt on top.  The sauce keeps at least a week in
  the refrigerator.
  
  Directions:
  
  Remove 3 lengthwise strips of peel from the lemon with a vegetable
  peeler. Put the peel into a medium-size saucepan along with the sugar
  and water. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring once or twice
  to help the sugar dissolve.  Reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes.
  
  Rinse the cranberries (don't rinse frozen berries), and remove any
  stems or squashed berries.  Add to the pan and when boiling, simmer
  about 5 minutes until most of the skins have popped. Remove and
  discard the lemon peel. Dip out about 1 cup of the popped berries and
  reserve.
  
  Puree the remaining berries and the syrup in a food processor or
  blender and put back in the pan.  Stir in the cinnamon and the
  reserved berries. Serve warm. Makes 2 cups.
  
  SUMMER CRANBERRY SAUCE:  Make this when cranberries aren't available.
  In a small saucepan, heat one 16-ounce can whole-berry crangerry
  sauce, 2 strips lemon peel, and about 1/16 teaspoon ground cinnamon.
  Simmer 5 minutes over low heat, stirring often, to develop the
  flavor. Discard peel. Serve sauce warm. Makes 1 1/2 cups.

  brown. Remove buns from oven and slide off pan on to wire rack over
  sheet of waxed paper.
  
   GLAZE: Whisk lemon juice and icing sugar together to form a runny bu
  slightly thickened mixture, rather like skim milk in color and
  translucence (glaze should not be so thick that it makes a white
  coating, hiding the cross). Brush glaze over buns while they're still
  hot (some icing will drip on to the waxed paper). If desired, wait 5
  minutes, then brush on a second coat of glaze.
  
   SPICE BLENDS: Just mix ingredients together and use as per recipe.
  
   FROZEN DOUGH METHOD: With rolling pin, press dough into a large
  rectangle. Sprinkle with raisins. Starting at long side, roll dough
  tightly into a log shape. Slice log into 9 sections.
   Form each section into a ball and place in square pan coated with non
  stick spray. Cover with sprayed plastic wrap and allow to double in
  size. Remove plastic wrap and bake at 350 F for 20 minutes or until
  golden brown. Remove immediately to cooling rack.
  
   TO MAKE ICING: Mix all icing ingredients together and place in a
  squeeze bottle, icing bag or gun.
   When buns are cool, use icing bag or snipped milk bag to squirt
  icing in a cross design on top.

      6 ts Cinnamon
  2 1/2 ts Ground ginger
      3 ts Coriander
      1 ts Nutmeg

           Thawed
      1 c  Raisins

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
      1 c  Icing sugar
      1 tb Butter, soft
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 tb To 3 tb milk
 
  * : Use either spice mixture for the recipe, not both.
  
   Heat water to just warmer than a baby bottle, but not hot (about 105
  F). Disolve sugar in water, then sprinkle yeast on top and let stand
  for 10 minutes until foamy. In a small bowl, warm milk and honey to
  same temperature. Whisk in the oil, egg and egg whites.
   In a large bowl, mix together the milk powder, whole-wheat flour, 1
  cup of the all-purpose flour, salt, spice blend (only one of them),
  raisins, currants and peel. Make a well in the centre of the dry
  ingredients and stir in yeast and milk mixtures.
   Gradually add 1 - 1 1/2 cups more all-purpose flour. When dough
  comes away from the sides pf the bowl, turn dough on to floured
  surface and knead for 10 minutes. Add more flour as needed to form an
  elastic dough. If raisins or peel pop out of the dough as you knead,
  just poke them back in and continue kneading.
   Lightly grease a bowl. Shape dough into a ball and place in greased
  bowl, turning to coat the ball with grease. Cover loosely with a tea
  towel and let rise until doubled in size, abt 1.5 hours.
   Punch dough down and knead into a ball.
   Divide dough into 20 equal parts. By repeatedly tucking the sides
  under and pressing up with your thumb, shape the 20 pieces of dough
  into tight round balls and place on a well greased baking sheet.
  Cover loosely with a tea towel and let rise until doubled in size,
  abt 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 F. Just before baking and adding
  cross, gently brush tops of buns with ligthly beaten egg white.
  
  TOPPING: Mix flour and sugar and enough water to make a thick , smooth
  paste. Spoon paste into pipping bag with a tiny hole snipped off
  bottom corner. Pipe a cross of flour paste on to each bun. Bake buns
  for 15 ~ 20 minutes,

 Categories: Stews
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
        1 lb hot dogs (not cheese
  :          filled)
        6 TB flour
      3/4    stick corn oil margarine or
        6 T  oil
        2    cloves garlic -- minced or
  :          smashed
        1 lg onion -- chopped
        1 sm green pepper -- chopped
  :          Parsley -- minced
  :          (optional)
        6 md white potatoes -- peeled
        1    chicken bouillon cube
  :          salt and pepper to taste
  
  In a very large skillet, or a medium dutch oven, make a light roux
  with margarine  and flour.  Add onion, garlic, and pepper and sautex
  until limp. Add potatoes, cut in chunks, stirring around a little.
  Add water to cover; bring to boil, reduce to si mmer. Add hot dogs,
  cut in chunks, stir, cover. Watch carefully until done to suit, (the
  potatoes should be falling apart), adding water if necessary. Salt
  and pepper to taste. A dab of yellow mustard on the side of the plate
  is good. This strange recipe is real comfort food for my family. I
  invented it when I was a young mother, desperate for something warm
  for lunch, when the ingredients were about all there was in the house
  and a trip to the store with three hungry kids was out of the
  question. It's based on my grandmother's IRISH POTATO STEW. Posted in

      Title: HOT DOG SURPRISE
 Categories: Car food, Quick/easy, Kids!
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     10 x  Hot dogs
        x  American cheese (or boutique
           -brand Wisconsin cheddar, if
           -you have an expensive car),
           -sliced into hot dog-length
           -fingers
     10 sl Bacon
 
  Distance:  40 miles
  
  At home or on the road, cut a deep slit in each wiener, and stuff with
  fingers of cheese.  Then wrap on the diagonal, like an old bias-ply
  tire, with the bacon. Seal individually in foil. These are great for
  stuffing into those odd places on the engine where you can't fit a
  turkey or a suckling pig.  Cook about 45 minutes, or until cheese is
  melted and bacon is somewhat crisp.

      Title: HOT DRESSING
 Categories: Sauces, Salads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      3 tb Balsamic vinegar
      1 tb Red wine vinegar
      1    Shallot; minced
      1 ts Chopped basil
      1    Garlic clove
 
  The "hot" in this dressing is in reference to temperature, not
  flavor, as it softens the tougher-leaved greens like radicchio.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Sprinkle a pinch of salt in a wooden salad
  bowl and rub the garlic clove all over to season the bowl. Add the
  salad greens. Heat oil, vinegars and shallots in a small saucepan,
  stirring occasionally. Pour hot dressing over greens and toss gently.
  Sprinkle salad with basil and toss again. Serve immediately.

  Remove meat from legs and breast of duck. Remove all skin and fat.
  Marinate duck meat, pork butt and veal shoulder with nutmeg,
  allspice, thyme, bay leaf, wine and garlic for 3 or 4 days in the
  refrigerator.
  
  Drain all the liquid and whole spices from the meat. Peel the garlic
  cloves, and, with the marinated meat, run through a meat grinder on a
  coarse setting. Mix the ground meat with the eggs, chopped truffles,
  pistachio nuts, duck glaze, truffle juice, salt and pepper to make a
  pate.
  
  Form pate into twelve 2-inch balls. Top each with a small slice of
  foie gras and a thin slice of truffle. Cut the puff pastry into 4
  pieces. Roll each piece into a strip, approximately 20-by-4-inches.
  Place 6 balls of pate, spaced at 3-inch intervals, on two of the
  pastry strips. Brush egg wash on the pastry surrounding the pate;
  cover with remaining sheets of pastry, pressing between the
  individual balls. Cut around each pate with a large ring cookie
  cutter, pressing to seal the edges. Place the sealed pates on a
  buttered baking sheet. Decorate the tops with leftover puff pastry
  (using egg wash as "glue"); then brush with egg wash. Bake in a 425'F
  oven for 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  Place the pates on serving plates and ring with Sauce Perigueux.

  ~-------------For the
  chicken:-------------------------------------------- ~----------For
  the salad:------------ -----------For the dressing:---------- TO MAKE
  THE CHICKEN, cut up breasts & season the nuggets with salt and
  pepper. Place the flour on a sheet of wax paper, and beat the eggs
  with the milk in a shallow bowl. Place the breadcrumbs on another
  sheet of wax paper. Dip the chicken pieces in the flour, shaking to
  remove any excess, then dip them in the egg mixture, and then in the
  breadcrumbs. Allow them to sit for 10 minutes so the crumbs will
  adhere. Prepare salad ingredients, and arrange them on 6 individual
  plates or a serving platter. To make the dressing, combine the honey,
  mustard, vinegar, salt and pepper in a bowl. Whisk until smooth, and
  then slowly whisk in the oils. To serve, heat the oil in a deep-sided
  pan over medium-high heat to a temperature of 375F. Add the chicken
  pieces, being careful not to crowd the pan, and fry until golden
  brown, about 5 minutes. The frying will have to be done in batches.
  Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain well on paper
  towels. Arrange the chicken pieces on top of the salads, and drizzle
  the dressing over all. Serves 6. Note: The salad is even quicker to
  make if you purchase the already-breaded chicken nuggets. You can buy
  nuggets already breaded in the poultry case or the freezer case.

           Text Only
 
  The other day I bought some vanilla ice cream to go with a can of
  chocolate sauce I'd bought about a week before. I bought the
  chocolate sauce to go on some ice cream that I didn't realize had
  been eaten by my roomy. When we got home, the chocolate sauce ended
  up in the bag belonging to a friend that we'd gone shopping with. So,
  unbeknownst to me, I didn't actually have any chocolate sauce to put
  on my newly acquired vanilla ice cream. I had bought chocolate sauce
  to go on non- existent ice cream and then bought ice cream to smother
  with the by then non-existent chocolate sauce. I didn't find this out
  until stricken by a severe attack of chocolate craving about midnight.
  
  I ransacked the kitchen to no avail.  Nada, zilch, zip chocolate
  sauce. "Ah-ha!" I thought...  "I'm a cook++I'll just make some.
  Yeah++ that's it, I'll make some!" Right...
  
  Oooopppsss...  No chocolate.  Hmmm.  But wait++here's some coco
  powder. A quick consultation with Irma and Marion told me I could
  make a substitute for chocolate using coco powder. Three tablespoons
  powder to 1 tablespoon butter = 1 oz. chocolate.  Bingo!  We're in
  business now...
  
  So I followed the following recipe making the pertinent
  substitutions...
  
  The grand kind that, when cooked for the longer period and served hot,
  grows hard on ice cream and enraptures children.
  
  Melt in a double boiler, over++not in++hot water:  2 oz. unsweetened
  chocolate.  [I used six tablespoons coco powder and 2 tablespoons
  butter. S.C.]
  
  Add and melt:  1 tablespoon butter.
  
  Stir and blend well, then add:  1/2 cup boiling water.
  
  Stir well and add:  1 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons corn syrup. [I had
  exactly two tablespoons left in the bottle. Whew! S.C.]
  
  Permit the sauce to boil readily, but not too furiously, over direct
  heat. Do not stir.  If you wish an ordinary sauce, boil it for 5
  minutes. If you wish a hot sauce that will harden over ice cream,
  boil it for about 8 minutes.  Add just before serving:  1 teaspoon
  vanilla or 2 teaspoons rum.
  
  When cold, this sauce is very thick.  It may be reheated over boiling
  water.
  
  Makes 1 cup.
  
  From "The Joy of Cooking", Vol II, Irma S.  Rombauer and Marion
  Rombauer Becker, 1964.  Signet.
  
  I tossed the cocoa powder and the butter in a sauce pan over low heat
  (none of this double boiler nonsense), melted the butter and stirred
  it until everything blended, then proceeded with the recipe as
  directed. Guess what? It worked out GREAT!  The sauce was just a tad
  grainy++ evidently I didn't cook it long enough to quite dissolve all
  the sugar. But what the heck++I'm a texture food freak anyway so I
  didn't see it as a drawback. And the taste really was good.

      Title: HOT GOOSEBERRY SOUFFLE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Gooseberry puree, thick and
           -sweetened
      6 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Flour
      1 c  Milk
      3 lg Eggs, separated
 
  In a heavy pan, melt the butter over low heat. As the butte melts,
  stir in the flour. Stir until smooth and blended, then gradually add
  the milk, stirring all the time so that the mixture remains smooth.
  Bring to the boiling point, still stirring, and cook for three
  minutes. Add the gooseberry puree and stir until thoroughly mixed.
  
  Beat the egg yolks until they are light and combine them with the
  gooseberry mixture. Beat the whites until they are stiff (this means
  that you can turn the bowl upside down without any ill effect), and
  use a metal spoon to gently fold the whites into the gooseberry
  mixture.
  
  Lightly oil a 5-cup soffle dish. Turn the mixture into the souffle
  dish and bake on the middle shelf of a preheated 375-degreeF oven for
  about 45 minutes. By this time the souffle should be crisp on the
  outside and still creamy on the inside. (For a more creamy result,
  bake the soffle in a water bath: Stand the souffle dish in a pan and
  pour enough hot water into the pan to cover the sides of the dish by
  about 2 inches.)
  
  Remember that the souffle will not remain at its best for more than a
  few minutes after leaving the oven.

  Charcoal-grilled fish takes on a new level of flavor when marinated
  in this wonderful sauce, intensified by a full tablespoon of Tabasco
  sauce. ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Prepare a charcoal fire for grilling. In a shallow
  dish, mix the lemon juice, butter, oil, parsley, sesame seeds,
  Tabasco sauce, ginger, and salt. With a fork, pierce the skin of each
  fish in several places. Roll the fish in the lemon juice mixture to
  coat thoroughly. Leave the fish in the marinade, cover the dish and
  refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour, turning the fish occasionally.
  
  Remove the fish, reserving the marinade, and place them in a hand-held
  hinged grill.  Brush the fish with the marinade. Cook about 4 inches
  from the hot coals for 5 minutes. Turn, brush with marinade, and cook
  for 5 minutes longer, or until the flesh appears opaque and flakes
  easily.

      Title: HOT ITALIAN SAUSAGE (2)
 Categories: Italian, Pork
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  2 1/2 ts Coarse (kosher) salt
    1/2 ts Whole black peppercorns
      6    Dried hot red peppers
           (each about 1-1/2 inches
           Long), seeds removed, OR
      2 ts Crushed dried red pepper
           Flakes
      1 tb Paprika
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 ts Fennel seeds
    1/2 ts Very finely minced garlic
  1 3/4 lb Lean, trimmed pork, cut
           Into 1-inch dice and
           Chilled
    1/2 lb Fresh pork fat, cut into
           1/2-inch dice and chilled
 
  1. Combine the salt, peppercorns, hot peppers, paprika, thyme, and
  fennel in a spice mill or a mortar and grind to a coarse texture, not
  a powder. Mix in a small bowl with the garlic. 2. Combine the meat,
  fat, and spices in a large bowl. 3. Put half the mixture in the
  container of a food processor and process to a medium-coarse grind
  (if you are using a meat grinder, follow the directions on page 4,
  using the medium disc). The meat and fat should be distinct from each
  other, but reduced to pieces of about the same size; do not
  overprocess. Scrape into a bowl. Repeat with the remaining
  ingredients, then knead the batches together, cover the bowl, and
  refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. 4. Stuff the casings as indicated in
  the general sausage-making instructions on pages 4-5, tying off the
  links at 4 to 5 inches. If weather is cool, hang the sausages for a
  few hours, until they are just dry to the touch. If it's too hot or
  humid to hang the sausages, simply refrigerate them, uncovered, for a
  minimum of 12 hours. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or
  freeze for longer storage. TO COOK: Prick the sausages with a needle
  and arrange in a single layer in a baking pan. Bake in a 425-degree
  oven for 25 minutes, or until browned, tuning often. Or place the
  pricked sausages in a large skillet and add 1/4 inch of water. Cook
  over moderate heat, turning often, until the water has evaporated and
  the sausages are well browned.

      Title: HOT OR COLD LEEK SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables, Tabasco
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Leek, (About 8 Ounces) *
      2 tb Olive Oil
      1    Onion, (About 6 Ounces),
           Peeled And Sliced
      6 c  Chicken Stock
  1 1/2 lb Potatoes, Peeled And Cut
           Into 2-Inch Cubes
           Salt To Taste (Depending On
           Saltiness Of Stock)
    1/2 ts Freshly Ground Black Pepper
           Bread Croutons, For Garnish

MMMMM-----------------------FOR COLD SOUP----------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Cold Milk
      6 tb Chives, Chopped
    1/4 ts Tabasco Sauce
 
  Remove the root end and any damaged outer leaves from the leek, but
  leave the remainder of the leaves intact. Split the leek in half
  lengthwise, and cut it into 1/2-inch pieces. Clean the leek by
  immersing the pieces in a bowl filled with cold water.  Lift the
  pieces from the water and place them in a sieve to drain. Heat the
  oil in a pot. When hot, add the leek and sliced onion, and cook over
  medium heat for about 5 minutes, until they soften and begin to brown
  lightly. Add the stock, potatoes, salt and pepper, and bring to the
  boil. Boil for 30 to 40 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.
  Strain off most of the cooking juices and reserve them. Add the
  solids with a little of the juices to the bowl of a food processor,
  and process briefly, just until pureed. (If too much liquid is added
  to the processor bowl, the mixture will become too foamy.) Stir the
  puree into the reserved juices. You should have about 7 cups. The hot
  soup can be served immediately, either plain or with croutons. FOR
  COLD SOUP: Cool the soup and stir in the milk, chives and Tabasco
  sauce. Serve cold. Serves 6. *If you cannot find leeks, add
  additional onions or scallions; the soup will be very good, although
  it won't have the unique taste that leeks give to soup. If using
  leeks or scallions, be sure to make use of the green as well as the
  white part of the vegetables, after trimming them first, of course,
  to eliminate any damaged or wilted sections. The green leaves lend
  color as well as taste and texture to the soup. Recipe from "Cuisine
  Economique" by Jacques Pepin. Source: Cuisine Economique - J. Pepin

      2 tb Soya sauce
      1 tb Wine
    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Peanuts
      2 tb Oil
 
  1. Cut chicken meat in sheets away from breast bone, slice into
  squares of 1x1". Dredge in a mixture of corn starch and salt on a
  piece of wax paper. Allow pieces to dry individually on wax paper
  about 20 minutes.
  
  2. Remove seeds from fresh peppers. Coarsely cut into strips. Reserve.
  
  3. Mix sugar, vinegar, soya sauce, wine together in a small bowl.
  Reserve.
  
  4. Heat oil in wok until smoking, add dredged chicken, stir fry on all
  sides. If oil is hot enough for chicken, pieces will not stick to wok.
  
  5. Add sugar and vinegar reserve, hot peppers. Place cover over wok.
  Add 1/2 cup water, cook over medium heat 5 minutes. Self gravy should
  form in the bottom of wok. Stir chicken in gravy so it will cook in
  gravy. Gravy should become gelatinous after 5 minutes of cooking. If
  it becomes too thick, thin gravy out with small amounts of water.
  
  6. Sprinle in 1 cup of peanuts, mix thoroughly.
  
  NOTE: Canned hot peppers are too soft to be used for this dish. If
  desired, dried cayenne peppers can be reconstituted for use. If you
  are fond of this dish, it is well to freeze your own hot peppers, in
  season.

      Title: HOT PEPPER VINEGAR
 Categories: Condiments
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     20    Hot peppers; fresh -- mixed
     50 ml Garlic
      1 tb Black peppercorns -- whole
      2 tb Cilantro -- dried
      1 qt Vinegar -- distilled white
 
  The above ingredients are approximations.  Vary them to control the
  flavor and heat content to your preference.
  
  Select a variety of hot peppers based on flavor and color. Stem them,
  and slit them open along the length of the pepper. Peel the garlic
  cloves and split them at least in half;in thirds if they are large.
  Put the peppers, garlic, peppercorns, and cilantro in a sterilized
  bottle with a tight fitting lid. Add the vinegar until the bottle is
  filled to the top and seal.
  
  Let the mixture sit for one week in a cool, dark place. Make sure to
  shake it gently at least once a day. Taste constantly, and enjoy the
  slowly building heat and flavor. At the end of the week, you can
  strain the mixture if you desire. Or, for a hotter brew, leave in the
  ingredients for another 1-3 weeks before straining.
  
  Better still is to leave in the ingredients, and to top off the
  vinegar with fresh as it is being used. When the heat and flavor
  starts to waver, strain the ingredients and replace with fresh ones.

  Combine water and yeast. Add 1 1/2 cup flour, butter, salt, and sugar
  and beat at least 3 minutes. Add remaining 1 1/4 cup flour and knead
  until dough is not sticky. Let rise in greased bowl until double.
  Punch down and divide into twelve pieces. Roll pieces into 18 inch
  long sticks with tapered ends. Loop into pretzel shape (helps to have
  a commercial pretzel handy if you can't remember what they look
  like). Place on greased baking sheet and let rise again until
  doubled. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F.
  
  Boil 4 cup water and 5 tsp baking soda (do not use aluminum pan) and
  lower each pretzel into the water with slotted spoon. Let stay in
  water about a minute or until they float. Return to greased cookie
  sheet and sprinkle with coarse salt.
  
  Bake until crispy and brown, about 12 minutes. Best eaten immediately
  but can be cooled and stored about a week.

      Title: HOT RED SNAPPER SOUP (KOREAN DOMI CHIGAE)
 Categories: Korean, Soups, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 lb Lean beef (shoulder)
  1 1/2 lb Red snapper
      2    Scallions
      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2    Cake bean curd
      2 c  Water
      2 tb Kochu Chang
 
  A chigae is usually a hot soup comprised of several ingredients. In
  this case, meat has been cooked with fish, the one to impart body,
  the other to add flavor. Kochu Chang is red bean paste, which may be
  purchased at many Oriental food stores. If it is not available,
  Japanese miso sauce may be substituted.
  
  1.  Shred the beef into 2-inch lengths. Cut the red snapper across
  the body into 1 1/2-inch widths, leaving the bones inside. Cut the
  scallions into 2-inch cubes.
  
  2.  Arrange the pieces of fish on the bottom of a pot. Add the
  scallions, then the beef. Now add the garlic. Mix the kochu chang
  with water and pour it over the other ingredients. Bring to a boil,
  then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Just before serving
  add the bean curd and cook for 3 minutes.
  
  Variation: Instead of red snapper, use a 1 1/2 to 2-pound sea bass,
  or a 1-pound codfish, or 2 small lobsters.

 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Pork spareribs, cut in pairs
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1 ea Onion, chopped
      4 ea Garlic cloves, minced
     10 oz Chile sauce
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
      2 tb Maple syrup
      2 tb Molassis
    1/2 c  Dijon mustard
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Hot pepper sauce
      1 ts Pepper, black, fresh ground
    1/4 ea Lemon, seeded and diced
    3/4 ts Cumin
      1 ts Coriander
    1/2 ts Ginger, ground
    1/4 ts Paprika, hot Hungarian
    1/8 ts Saffron, crumbled (optional)
 
  Parboil the spareribs for 1-2 minutes.  This will result in a better
  textured meat.  Tightly wrap each pair of ribs in foil and place on a
  rack in a large baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.
  Meanwhile, make the BBQ sauce.  Saute the onion and garlic in the oil
  over low heat for 5 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients, mix
  thoroughly and cook 10 minutes.  Remove the ribs from the over,
  discard the foil, and brush both sides of the ribs with the sauce.
  Return ribs to oven and bake, uncovered for 25-30 minutes more

      Title: HOT RUM TODDY
 Categories: Drinks, Alcohol
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 lb Dark brown sugar
    1/2 lb Butter, salted
      1 ts Nutmeg, ground
      1 ts Cinnamon, ground
      1 ts Cloves, ground
      1 ts White cardamom,
           -ground
           Dark rum, top-quality
           -(a standard "fifth"
           -will serve 12)
 
  MAKING THE BATTER:  Put all batter ingredients (everything but the
  rum) in a food processor and run it until the mixture turns creamy.
  Fold it down once with a rubber spatula to make sure the spices are
  blended in, and run the food processor some more.
  
  Scoop the mixture into a plastic container, and refrigerate. It will
  keep for many months in the refrigerator, even though it contains
  butter.
  
  MAKING THE DRINKS:  Fill a coffee mug half full of boiling water. The
  easiest way to do this is to put a mug of hot water in the microwave.
  If you don't have a microwave, then fill the mug with boiling water,
  pour it out, then fill it half full of boiling water.
  
  Add about 2 generous tablespoons of batter.  Stir until the batter
  dissolves in the hot water. I use a small wire whisk for this
  stirring.
  
  Add 2 jiggers (about 3 oz) of the best rum you can afford. When I
  make this in quantities for parties I like to use Myers Dark Rum.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Ultimate hot buttered rum recipe -- I started making hot buttered
  rum from a Trader Vic recipe 15 years ago, and I have gradually
  evolved it by adding more spices, more butter and less rum.
  
  The way you make a hot buttered rum is to add some "batter" to some
  rum, and heat it. I like to keep a made-up batch of the batter in the
  refrigerator in an old margarine tub. For parties I make up a fresh
  batch.
  
  *  One theory of hot-toddy making is that it is impossible to use too
  much batter, and you should keep stirring more in until you are bored
  with stirring. Another theory of hot-toddy making is that it is
  impossible to use too much rum, and that you should keep stirring in
  more until your friends panic.

  finger). Marinate for about half an hour.
  
  Heat the wok until a drop of water dropped into it dances around as it
  boils. Add enough oil to coat the wok and saute the ginger. Stir-fry
  the lettuce. Stir-fry the beef (in batches so the wok doesn't cool
  down too much).
  
  Reduce the heat.  Return the vegetables to the wok. Add the topping.
  Stir around until everything is mixed and heated evenly. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very hot, very simple, very good beef stir-fry -- This recipe has
  been floating around for years back east, where it's also known as
  Hot Flaming Death.
  
  *  Also add any other vegetables that you feel like. Sliced carrots or
  broccoli are especially nice.
  
  *  Hot bean paste also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc. This
  is the main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care. Vary
  this ingredient to taste.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Title: HOT SHINS
 Categories: Barbeque, Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     16 ea Chicken Drumsticks (2 /12 to
           -3 1/2 pounds)
    1/4 c  Flour
      2 ts Paprika
      1 ts Black pepper, ground
      1 ts White pepper, ground
      1 ts Cayenne pepper, ground
      1 ts Thyme, ground
      1 ts Garlic, powder
      1 ts Salt
 
  The day before you plan to serve these drumsticks, lay them out on a
  cutting board or butcher block and pierce them all over with a fork so
  that, when they are seasoned, the spices will permeate the meat
  nicely. Set aside.
  
  Measure into a Ziploc-type plastic bag the flour, paprika, black,
  white, and cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic powder, and salt. Close the
  bag and shake to blend the spice well.
  
  Add the drumsticks to the bag, zip it shut again, and shake until the
  drumsticks are thoroughly coated with the seasoning. Refrigerate
  overnight.
  
  The following day, about 2 hours before dinnertime, fire up your
  smoker and, when the coals are glowing, add some wet wood to the fire
  pan and fill the water pan halfway with hot water. Transfer the
  drumsticks from their bag to the grill and cover the smoker snugly.
  
  Smoke at 200 to 220 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the juice
  runs clear when the meat is pricked and the drums are lusciously
  tender.

  through, add to tomatoes.
  
  4. Toss capers and lemon juice with tomatoes and shrimp. Season with

 Categories: Poultry, Oriental, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Chicken pieces
           - (wings or thighs)
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Scallions
    2/3 c  Oil, preferably peanut
      1    Dried red chile
           -halved lengthwise
      1 ts Oil
    1/2 ts Finely chopped ginger root
      1 ts Chili bean sauce; -=OR=-
    1/2 ts Chili powder
  1 1/3 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 ts Ground Sichuan peppercorns
           -Roasted, (optional)
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
 
  RUB THE CHICKEN PIECES with the salt and let them sit for about 30
  minutes. Cut the scallions into 2-inch pieces. Heat the 2/3 cup of
  oil in a wok or large skillet, and then add the dried chile to flavor
  the oil. When it turns black, turn the heat down. (At this point you
  may remove the chile or leave it in as the Chinese do.) Slowly brown
  the chicken pieces, a few at a time, skin-side down. Turn the chicken
  pieces over and brown the other side. Drain the cooked pieces on
  paper towels. Heat a clean wok or skillet and add 1 teaspoon oil. Fry
  in it the scallions, ginger and chili bean sauce (or chile powder),
  taking care not to have the heat too high or the sauce will burn. A
  few seconds later, add the chicken stock, Sichuan peppercorns, sugar
  and dark soy sauce. Then turn the heat down low, and add the chicken
  pieces. Cover, and finish cooking the chicken in this sauce, turning
  the pieces from time to time. This should take about 20-to-30
  minutes. Serve the chicken with the sauce, first removing any surface
  fat.
