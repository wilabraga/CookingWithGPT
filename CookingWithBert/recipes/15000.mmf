  spoon to incorporate.  Sift flour, baking powder and salt directly
  into chocolate mixture.  Gently stir until the dry ingredients are
  barely incorporated. Cut the 6 oz of semi-sweet chocolate into 1/2
  inch chunks and stir into dough along with the toasted nuts. Lightly
  butter 4 aluminum baking sheets. (do not use foil or cookies will
  burn) Drop dough by tablespoonfuls, 12 to a sheet to leave room for
  cookies to spread. Bake only one sheet at a time in center of oven.

      Title: CHOCOLATE & CHESTNUT LOAF
 Categories: Desserts, Cakes
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
 15 1/2 oz Can unsweetened chestnut
           Puree
      6 oz Unsalted (sweet) butter
      4 oz Castor sugar (v. fine grain)
      8 oz Darkest plain chocolate
      2 tb Brandy
           Piped cream (optional)
           Maron glace (optional)
 
  Recommended to make 1 day ahead.
  
  Melt Chocolate (this should be at least 55% cocoa - 75% is great!).
  
  Put better in bowl. Beat until pale and creamy. Add sugar and beat
  until fluffy andf light. Add chestnut puree and beat until thoroughly
  blended and smooth. (a mixer is so much easier!!! I didn't have one
  and found the best way to make sure it wasn't lumpy was to press the
  puree through a sieve first - interesting texture!).
  
  Add melted chocolate, brandy and 1 tb of water. Mix thoroughly.
  
  Brush a 2lb bread tin lightly with oil and line with greaseproof
  paper and brush LIGHTLY with oil.
  
  Put mixture into tin - flatten top and place lightly oiled greaseproof
  paper on top. Cover tin with foil and refigerate for at least 8 hours.
  
  Serve straight from fridge optionally decorated with piped cream
  and/or maron glace.
  
  Note: This is a VERY rich desert; a 3/4 inch slice is usually enough!
  
  Time: about an hour (+8 hours cooling) Source: My sister

      Title: CHOCOLATE & PEANUT BUTTER CRESCENTS
 Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Cookies
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      2 c  Sifted all purpose flour
    1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 lb (1 stick) butter
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1    Egg
 
  Sift together the flour, cocoa, and salt and set aside. In the large
  bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter. Beat in the vanilla and
  sugar. Add the egg and beat until thoroughly mixed. On low speed
  gradually add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl with a
  rubber spatula and beating until the mixture holds together. Transfer
  the dough to a small bowl for ease in handling and set aside at room
  temperature. Prepare the filling.
  
  3/4 cup smooth (not chunky) peanut butter 1/2 cup strained or sifted
  confectioners sugar.
  
  In a small bowl thoroughly mix the peanut butter and the sugar.
  
  Adjust rack to the center of the oven and preheat to
      325    degrees.
  
  To shape the cookies:  On a large piece of wax paper place the cookie
  dough in mounds, using a slightly rounded tsp. (no more) of the dough
  for each mound-in order not to make them too large it's best to
  measure with a measuring spoon.  Do maybe a quarter of the dough at a
  time.
  
  Then do the same with the filling, using a level 1/2 measuring
  teaspoon for each mound.  Place on other pieces of waxed paper.
  
  Pick up one mound of the dough, roll it between your hands into a
  ball, and flatten it between your palms until it is very thin. Then,
  with a small metal spatula or a table knife, lift up and place one
  mound of the filling in the center of the flattened dough. With your
  fingers bring the dough around the filling and pinch the edges to
  seal. Roll the filled dough between your hands into a cylindrical
  shape about 2 inches long with very slightly tapered ends.  Place the
  cookie on an unbuttered cookie sheet and as you do, turn the ends
  down slightly to form a short fat crescent. Continue shaping the
  cookies and placing them 1/2 to 1 inch apart-these do not spread.
  
  Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until the cookies are firm to the touch.
  Reverse the cookie sheet front to back once to insure even bakinZ of
  sugar and roll the cookies in the sugar as they come out of oven.

  in plastic wrap and chill for 1 to 2 hours. Bake at 375 deg f for 10
  to 12 minutes. Makes 5-6 cookies.
    NOTE::Form cookies as follows: 1. Mix dough and chill. 2. Lightly
  oil mold using pastry brush or cooking spray. 3. Blot out excess. 4.
  Dust mold with flour. Knock out excess by tapping mold on hard
  surface like a cutting board. 5. Using heel of hand press dough into
  mold. 6. Level dough with a knife or spatula, using a sawing motion.
  7. To remove dough from mold, rap the mold against a protected
  surface ( a cutting board covered with a towel works well). Hold mold
  upright and rap the mold sharply against the board 2 to 3 times. As
  the dough begins to fall out, catch with hand and lay on ungreased
  cookie sheet. If dough does not come out, rotate mold and rap the
  other side. 8. Mold remaining dough, but do not re-oil mold.

    3/4 c  Sliced almonds
    1/2 c  Plus 2 T granulated sugar
      2    Egg whites
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Almond extract
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 tb Confectioners' sugar

MMMMM---------------------CHOCOLATE GANACHE--------------------------
      6 oz Semi-sweet chocolate;
           -broken into 1/2-oz pcs.
      7 tb Heavy cream
      1 ts Granulated sugar
      1 ts Unsalted butter
 
  EQUIPMENT:  Measuring cup, measuring spoons, 2 baking sheets, food
  processor with metal blade, electric mixer with balloon whip, rubber
  spatula, parchment paper, pastry bag, double boiler, film wrap,
  whisk, 1 1/2-qt saucepan, small stainless steel bowl, medium star tip
  
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Lightly toast the almonds on a baking
  sheet in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and
  cool to room temperature. Reduce the oven temperature to 225 degrees.
  In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, coarsely
  process the toasted almonds with 2 tablespoons of sugar into pieces
  1/8 inch in size. Set aside until needed. Line two baking sheets with
  parchment paper. Create a meringue by whisking the egg whites on
  medium speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon
  whip. Whisk until frothy, about 1 minute. Add the cream of tartar and
  salt, increase speed to high, and whisk until the egg whites begin to
  stiffen, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. While continuing to whisk on high speed,
  gradually add 1/2 cup granulated sugar. The egg whites should form
  peaks that are stiff, but not dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add almond
  extract and whisk on high for an additional 30 seconds. Remove the
  bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in the chopped
  almonds and cornstarch.

  Preparation Time: 1:30 1. In a small skillet, melt butter over low
  heat. Let stand a few mins. Skim off and discard white foam from top
  and do not use any milky residue that sinks to bottom. The clear
  yellow liquid is clarified butter. 2. Preheat oven to 350 F. In a
  medium bowl, combine pecans, cinnamon, 1/4 cup sugar, and chocolate
  chips; mix well. Open and stack filo sheets on a damp towel. Cover
  with a damp towel to prevent drying out. Brush a 12 x 18-in sheet
  cake pan with clarified butter. Layer half of filo sheets (about 10 x
  12) in pan, brushing each sheet with butter. Spread half of nut
  mixture evenly over layered filo sheets. Brush next filo sheet on
  both sides with butter; then place on top of nuts. Add 5 or 6 more
  filo sheets, brushing each sheet with butter. Top with remaining nut
  mixture. Butter next filo sheet on both sides and place on top of
  nuts. Top with remaining filo sheets, brushing each with butter. 3.
  Using a sharp knife, cut pastry into 50 diamond-shaped pieces. Do not
  remove pastry from pan. Brush top with remaining clarified butter.
  Bake 40 to 50 mins, or until golden. 4. About 30 mins before baklava
  is finished baking, in a small saucepan, combine remaining 1/2 cup
  sugar and orange juice. Heat to boiling over medium heat, stirring
  often. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 mins. Stir in vanilla.
  Pour hot orange syrup over hot pastry as soon as it is removed from
  oven. Let stand until cool, 4 hours or over night. 5. When baklava is
  cool, drizzle Thin Chocolate Glaze on top. Allow glaze to set up
  before serving. Baklava may be kept, covered, 4 to 5 days at room
  temperature. Freeze for longer storage.

      Title: CHOCOLATE BALLS WITH CHERRY CENTERS
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     50    Whole candied cherries
    3/4 c  Cherry brandy (more may be
           -necessary)
    1/2 lb Sweet milk chocolate, broken
           -into pieces
    1/4 lb Unsweetened baking
           -chocolate, broken into
           -pieces
  1 1/3 c  Powdered sugar
    7/8 c  Butter, softened
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
           Powdered sugar
           Unsweetened cocoa
 
  Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer. Drain the
  cherries, reserve the brandy.
  
  Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
  chocolates.  Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the
  butter and sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.
  
  Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir by hand
  until all is absorbed.  Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.
  
  Put mixture in the freezer and thoroughly chill. Prepare a surface to
  assemble the balls.  Mix equal amounts of cocoa and powdered sugar,
  about 1/3 cup each. On a piece of waxed paper, heavily dust with the
  cocoa powdered sugar mixture.  Remove the chocolate from the freezer
  when it is chilled and stiff. For each cherry, spoon out a heaping
  teaspoon of the chocolate and drop on dusted paper. Dip your fingers
  into the cocoa/sugar mixture and flatten chocolate to a small
  pancake. Place a cherry in the center and fold chocolate around it.
  Gently roll the ball between your palms to form and finish by rolling
  the ball in the cocoa/sugar mixture. Repeat for each cherry. If the
  chocolate mixture softens, return to the freezer to firm up.
  
  Place the completed balls in a container with a lid and store in the
  frig.
  
  These balls are dense and heavy with a rich chocolate flavor. For a
  lighter flavor, I suggest you omit the unsweetened baking chocolate
  and add 1/4 lb. more milk chocolate.
  
  Licking your fingers is not permitted during the assembly, but
  manditory after you are done.  (grin)

  There's yet another variation to chocolate covered cherries. It's for
  the brave & daring at heart.
  
  You have to start in the summertime, when cherries are ripe. You take
  a pound of them, a pound of rock candy, and a fifth of good brandy or
  bourbon. Mix together, & let set in the back of the 'fridge for 3-4
  months.
  
  When you finally get around to making the chocolate covered cherries,
  you use the preserved cherries for the centers, & the liquor as the
  base for the cordial. Courtesy of: Al Martin

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      5 x  Small bananas
      3 oz Bittersweet chocolate
      1 c  Cake flour *
      2 tb Milk
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Crme patissire,
           Recipe follows

  * Sift and measure cake flour. Butter two, 8 in. round pans. Line
  them with wax paper, butter the paper and flour the pans. Place two
  bananas and the milk in a electric blender or food processor. Blend
  at low speed until homogenized. Set aside. In top of a double boiler,
  over hot, but not simmering water, melt the chocolate. Set aside.
  Preheat oven to 325'F. Beat egg whites with 1/2 cup sugar until peaks
  keep their shape. Set aside. Beat the yolks with the remaining 1/4 c
  sugar until thick and ribbonlike. Fold the bananas and the chocolate
  into the beaten egg yolk. Alternately, a third at a time, fold the
  beaten egg whites and the flour into the chocolate mixture.  Mix only
  until smooth. Do not overmix.
    Divide batter equally between the prepared pans and bake in the
  pr-heated, 325'F. oven until a knife inserted into the centre comes
  out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool two minutes in the pans, then
  gently invert on a cooling rack.
    When cool, split each layer.  Peel and cut three banaas into 1/8 in.
  segments.  Place banana slices on the cream. Assemble the cake with
  the cream and banana slices between layers. Sprinkle the top with

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------SUSAN AARONSON PSTT79C------------------------
           Perfect strawberries
           <<<OR Better Still>>>
           Long stemmed berries
           That are sold in many
           Fruit markets
      6 oz Good quality bittersweet
           Chocolate
           Orange sections
           White chocolate; opt'l
 
  Here's the recipe for the chocolate berries or orange sections. Pick
  out perfect strawberries with fresh looking green tops, or better
  still, get the long stemmed berries that are sold in many fruit
  markets. Wash and THOROUGHLY DRY the berries on paper toweling. If
  any of the berries have soft spots, don't dip them. The juice will
  leak out and the finished product will look awful. Melt about 6
  ounces of very good quality bittersweet chocolate. I use Belgian or
  French chocolate, but Lindt or Tobler are also excellent. Line cookie
  sheets with waxed paper. When chocolate is melted and smooth pour it
  into a dish that will give you depth rather than surface.  Pick up a
  berry by the leaves and dip it into the chocolate about 3/4 of the
  way, leaving the stems and a bit of the berry showing. Let excess
  chocolate drip back into the bowl and place the dipped berry onto the
  lined cookie sheet. Put in refrigerator to harden chocolate. If you
  want to get fancier, melt some white chocolate and dip the very
  bottom of the dark chocolate dipped berry into the white chocolate or
  put the melted white chocolate into a pastry bag, fitted with a very
  fine writing tip, and sort of 'write' squiggly lines all over the dark
  chocolate.  I like to serve these berries on non-toxic green leaves
  or palm fronds that can be purchased from a florist. Orange sections
  dipped in chocolate are a bit trickier but fantastic. Completely peel
  an orange, being very careful not to pierce the membrane that
  surrounds each section. Remove as much of the pith that clings to the
  orange section. Blot the sections on paper towels to absorb ANY
  moisture. Melt the chocolate as described above and put it into a
  dish that is large enough to accommodate a whole section of orange.

 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Sugar (or more)
    1/2 c  Cocoa
      2 ts Flavoring (I used raspberry;
           Orange or almond would work
           Nicely too)
      2    Egg equivalents
    3/4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
           Splash of liquor to match
           Flavoring (I used Chambord)
 
  Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, salt and baking baking powder.
  Separately, mix flavoring and eggs.  Combine. Add splash of liquor or
  water as needed to have a sticky consi stency. If the mixture is too
  stiff, it won't spread out properly.
  
  Put this glob on a greased cookie sheet and arrange it into a log
  about 15 inch es long and 1 1/2 - 2" wide. Bake at 350 for 25
  minutes. Remove from oven, let cool a few minutes, then slice
  diagonally into 1/2- 3/4" slices. I got 18 pieces from mine.  Place
  the slices on their side and put back in the oven (300 degrees) for
  15 minutes. Turn over and cook another 10-15 minutes.
  
  If you can afford the fat, a small drizzle of semisweet chocolate is
  wonderful on these when cooled. I used about 2 T. for all the cookies,
  which added about 6 g. fat to the recipe or 1/3 g. fat each one.

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    2/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      3 oz Unsweetened chocolate,chop

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      4 oz Butter
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      3 ea Eggs
      3 c  Confectioner's sugar
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
  
  Cake:
  
  Butter 2 9" cake pans, dust with flour, set aside. Stir cocoa with
  some milk to form a paste. Stir in the rest of the milk and beat with
  a whisk until smooth. Set aside. Cream the butter and shortening with
  the sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each
  addition. Add the vanilla and blend. Sift the flour with the baking
  powder, baking soda and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter in
  three parts, alternating between each addition with the cocoa
  mixture, beating after each addition. BEAT ONLY TILL INGREDIENTS ARE
  ABSORBED. Divide batter equally in the two cake pans. Bake 35 to 40
  minutes, or untill cake pulls away from sides on pan, and a cake
  tester (toothpick) inserted into cake comes out clean. Place cakes on
  wire racks and allow to cool completely.
  
  Filling:
  
  Combine sugar, cornstarch and salt in small saucepan. Gradually add
  the milk while mixing with a wire whisk. Add the chopped chocolate.
  Place over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, untill mixture
  thickens and bubbles for three minutes. Filling should have the
  texture of pudding (because that's just what it is). Place in small
  bowl to cool with plastic wrap directly cxovering the surface to
  prevent a skin from forming.

      Title: CHOCOLATE BLOOD CAKE
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        1 lg bar white chocolate (500g at
  :          least)
        1    Bottle red food colouring
  :          vast number of red smarties
  :          (or M&M's if you can't get
  :          thing)
  :          Icing (frosting for you USA
  :          types)
        1    tub strawberry ice cream
  :          set of plastic vampire
  :          teeth
  
  Dead simple this. Make up the sponge mix but add loads of red food
  colouring to get the mixture nice and blood like. Next, add about
  400g of the chocolate (melted of course) to the sponge mix, adding
  more food colouring if the mixture seems to be getting too pinky.
  Allow to cook for the normal length of time. Make up quite a bit of
  icing in the meantime (adding the final 100g of chocolate to this)
  and colour this red also.
  
  When the cake has cooked, allow to cool for about 1 hour and then cut
  in 1/2. taking the top half, pour the icing over and allow to set
  pretty randomly, but place the vampire teeth in the icing where they
  will cause maximum effect (in the centre is usually a good bet).
  Before you serve this cake, place a generous layer of the ice-cream
  on top of the bottom layer and replace the top. serve with extra
  scoops of the ice cream and strawberry sauce.
  
  Enjoy!

  Whoops. Forgot to say mix the smarties into the cake mix, and stick a
  few more in the icing. And remember use RED ones (you can really
  freak ppl out by telling them they are blood clots!)

           -Natalie Canfield(sxnj32b)
      1    Semisweet chocolate morsels
           -(6 oz)
    1/2 c  Bourbon
      3 tb Light corn syrup
  2 1/2 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar; sifted
      1 c  Pecans; finely chopped
           Powdered sugar
 
  Melt chocolate morsels in top of double boiler or in microwave. When
  smoothly melted, remove from heat and stir in bourbon and corn syrup.
  Set aside.  Combine crumbs, powdered sugar and pecans. Mix well. Stir
  into chocolate mixture; let stand 30 minutes.  Shape into 1" balls.
  Roll in sugar.  Store in an airtight container in refrigerator.
  Yield: about 5 dozen.  Got this from December '84 issue of Southern

  house! You can substitute english walnuts for the pecans. You can
  also use rum instead of bourbon. I have tried several combinations,
  but find the original the best to my taste.

  Hi there!  I use this recipe in my bread machine but you could bake
  it in two loaf pans just as easily. It's heavenly when it's warm and
  spread with cream cheese! All I have to do is dump the ingredients
  into the bread machine and press a button.  You'd have to knead, etc.
  without one. Possible, but I have no pioneer spirit.

      Title: CHOCOLATE BREAD 2
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      1    Pkg Active Dry Yeast
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Warm Water
      1 c  Warm Water
      4 c  All-Purpose Flour
    1/3 c  Dutch Process Cocoa,
           -Unsweetened
      2 ts Salt
      1    Egg, Lightly Beaten
      2 tb Sweet Butter, At Room
           -Temperature
      1 c  Chocolate Morsels
 
  Combine the yeast with half the sugar and the first measure of warm
  (110 degree) water. Let stand until foamy (about 3 minutes). Combine
  the flour, cocoa and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Use a
  wooden spoon to stir in the yeast mixture, the butter, remaining
  sugar and the second measure of water. Fit the mixer with a dough
  hook and knead the dough at medium speed until the dough is smooth
  and supple (about 10 minutes). Turn out onto a lightly floured board.
  Knead by hand for 1 minute, adding more flour if needed. The dough
  must be quite firm, not sticky, as it must stand on its own. Knead in
  the chocolate morsels. Place the dough in the mixing bowl. Cover with
  greased plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk
  (1-1 1/2 hours). Grease the baking pan. Turn the dough out. Punch
  down. Knead for 1 minute to expel air. Let rest for 5 minutes. Form
  into an 8" x 4" oval. Place on the baking pan. Preheat the oven to
  400 degrees. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap. Let rise until
  doubled in bulk (about 1 hour). Place the baking pan on the middle
  rack of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375
  degrees. Bake for another 25 minutes. Cool on a rack. Serve with
  sweet butter.

      2 ts Cornstarch
        pn Salt
 
  Last night I finally tried the chocolate bread recipe in "Sweet
  Nothings" and it was GREAT! The only fat comes from that which is in
  1/3 C. of cocoa powder and the bread. It's supposed to have 3 eggs,
  but I didn't have any eggs so I used substitute instead and it was
  fine.
  
  Even though I was out of a lot of the ingredients, I managed to
  make-do with what I had on hand. Perhaps it would've been tastier if
  made exactly according to recipe, but as it stands it's pretty damn
  tasty!
  
  Here's the original unaltered recipe (my alterations are below):
  
  Arrange bread slices, staggering them, in a 12 - 14" long oval gratin
  dish or a 4 C souffle dish.
  
  In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, honey, sugar, vanilla
  and brandy or Kahlua. Sift the cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt
  together onto the egg mixture, then whisk until thoroughly combined
  (and your arm will probably want to fall off at this point).
  
  Pour the cocoa-egg mixture evenly over the bread slices and let stand
  until all the bread is thoroughly saturated with the custard.
  Depending upon the freshness of the bread (5) and the dish you
  choose, this could take 1 - 2 hrs. Bake the pudding in a 325 deg F
  oven for 40 - 60 min, until it is barely firm to the touch but not
  dry and pulling away from the sides of the dish. Serve warm or,
  alternatively, cover and chill thoroughly before serving. 170
  calories, 2.
        7 g  fat (6)
  
  1) I didn't have the right bread but I did have some Squaw bread in
  the freezer so I dried it out in the over at a low temperature for
  about 1/2 an hour.
  
  2) I didn't have eggs so I used egg sub.
  
  2.  5) Forgot this one. I didn't have any skim milk on hand so I used
  a can of nonfat evaporated milk and added water to make 2. 5 C.
  
  3) I didn't have any honey so I used corn syrup (a little extra
  because honey is so sweet).
  
  4) You can use unsweetend Herschey's cocoa for it if you don't want
  to try to locate dutch-process. Actually, dutch-processing just
  leaves more of the fat in the cocoa.
  
  5) I broke the bread up into pieces rather than leaving it in slices.
  I figured that would help along the soaking process. I let it soak
  for 10-15 min.
  
  6) Probably lots less fat without using real eggs. I estimate 3g from
  the cocoa. At most only 1g or so per serving. -- npm@netcom. com

      2 c  Soft white bread crumbs
           - (loosely packed)
      2    Jumbo eggs

  completely melted. Remove pan from the heat, stir in the crumbs and
  let stand for one hour. Preheat oven to 350F. Beat the eggs until
  frothy, blend in the sugar, vanilla and salt, then mix into the
  chocolate. Pour the pudding into a buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole,
  set it in a shallow baking pan and pour enough hot water into the pan
  to come halfway up the sides of the casserole. Bake the pudding
  uncovered for 50 to 60 minutes until the pudding is set like custard.
  To test it, insert a toothpick in the center. If it comes out clean,
  pudding is done. Serve the pudding warm, topped with dollops of
  whipped cream.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 lb Butter
    1/3 c  Honey
      1 lg Egg
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
           Flour (1.1 C --> glass
           -measuring cup filled
           -to the top)
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Chocolate chips
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the
  brown sugar, add egg and vanilla. Mix well. Add honey.
  
  Measure flour and baking soda (I usually just mix the soda in with the
  flour.) Add flour and soda to batter a little at a time and mix. Add
  chocolate chips.
  
  Drop by spoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 5-8
  minutes at 375 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate chip cookies with honey and brown sugar.
  
  *  For those of you who like your cookies warm!  I always make up only
  enough to eat, and store the batter in the fridge.
  
  *  You can substitute margarine for the butter if you want.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
  processor is tedious.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  bowl). Fill the bottom vessel half full with hot tap water (120130
  degrees) and place the chocolate/butter bowl on top to melt. You may
  put the double boiler on the stove over a very low flame just to
  maintain the water's temperature while melting the mixture if you
  wish. Stir occasionally to blend until the mixture is smooth, shiny
  and liquid. Remove from the water, and set aside. Yield: one scant cup

      Title: CHOCOLATE BUTTERMILK CAKE
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 c  Flour
  1 1/4 c  Cocoa
  1 1/2 ts Baking Soda
  1 1/2 ts Baking Powder
  1 1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon
  2 1/4 c  Buttermilk
  1 1/2 c  Thick Sour Cream
  1 1/2 tb Instant Coffee Crystals
      2 c  Sweet Butter
  2 1/4 c  Sugar
  2 1/4 c  10x Powdered Sugar
      3    Eggs
  2 1/4 c  Heavy Cream
 
  THE CAKE: Preheat oven to 350øF.  Grease 3 round, 9" cake pans. Line
  bottoms with greased wax paper. Sift together flour, 3/4 c cocoa,
  baking soda, baking powder and cinnamon. Mix in buttermilk and coffee
  (dissolve coffee in an equal amount of hot water first.) Cream 1 1/2
  c butter with the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a
  time until thick. Beating on low speed, slowly mix in buttermilk
  mixture. Beat 'til well blended.  Bake about 35 minutes, or until a
  straw comes out clean. Remove to racks to cool. After they are
  cooled, put in 'fridge'. After 1 hour in 'fridge', split each in half
  (see note at bottom.) Wrap each layer in wax paper or plastic wrap,
  and freeze immediately. SOUR CREAM FILLING: Beat 3/4 c heavy cream,
  gradually adding 3/4 c 10x sugar until stiff. Gently fold in 3/4 c
  sour cream. Set aside in 'fridge' (covered.) CHOCOLATE SOUR CREAM
  FROSTING: Melt remaining (1/2 c) butter.  Add 1/2 c 10x sugar and
  remaining (1/2 c) cocoa.  Stir with a wire whisk over low heat until
  smooth; cool. Beat remaining (1 1/2 c) heavy cream; add remaining (1
  1/2 c) 10x sugar until soft peaks form.  Add cooled chocolate
  mixture; beat until stiff. Fold in remaining (3/4 c) sour cream.
  CONSTRUCTION: Build layers from the bottom up as follows: Cake, 1/3
  the filling, cake, 2/3 c frosting. Repeat above twice, for total of
  six layers. Put remaining frosting on sides. Chill two hours before
  serving. Note: The cakes must be well-chilled before assembly, or
  they will disintegrate under their own weight during assembly. If the
  cake tops rose during baking, the layers will not stack well. You
  will need to slice the excess off *after* chilling, but *before*
  splitting into layers. Source: Someone named Judith Olney, I'm sure.

      Title: CHOCOLATE BUTTER~ NUTTED OR NOT
 Categories: Desserts, Sauces, Spreads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Packed, high quality Dutch-
           Process cocoa
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Hot water
    3/4 c  High-quality unsalted butter
           At room temperature
    1/2 ea To 1 tsp. vanilla extract or
           To taste
    1/8 ts Almond extract
      1 c  Toasted and coarsely chopped
           Walnuts or toasted, skinned
           And coarsely chopped hazel-
           Nuts (optional)
 
  Combine the cocoa, sugar and salt in the top pan of a double boiler
  (or use a heatproof bowl that can be placed over a saucepan,
  containing simmering water). Stir the mixture with a whisk until it
  is thoroughly mixed, then mix in the hot water thoroughly.  Set the
  pan over simmering water and stir the contents until the sugar has
  completely dissolved and the mixture is hot, about 3 minutes.  Remove
  the top from the base and set it aside; cool the contents to lukewarm.
  
  Cream the butter together with the vanilla and the almond extracts in
  the small bowl of an electric mixer, or use a food processor to beat
  the butter with the flavorings just until it is light. With the motor
  of the machine running, gradually add the lukewarm chocolate mixture,
  continuing to beat just until everything is well combined. Let the
  chocolate butter cool completely, stirring or whisking it
  occasionally to lighten its texture. Add the nuts, if you're making
  the nutted version; then scrape the chocolate butter into a clean,
  dry storage jar, cover it tightly and refrigerate it.  Makes about 2
  1/2 cups with nuts or 1
      3/4    cups without nuts.
  
  Note:  This wonderful recipe was copied from The Old Farmer's Almanac
  Good Cook's Companion magazine referring to the recipes creator,
  Helen Witty's recipe from her book "A Little of What You Fancy
  (Workman, 1997). She describes chocolate butter as "a luxurious
  spread/sauce/confection that keeps up to six weeks in the
  refrigerator unless you devour it first; warmed as a sauce, spread as
  a cake or cookie filling, or rolled into instant truffles".  How
  could anyone pass up this recipe? Converted to Meal-Master by Kountry

 Categories: Misc
      Yield: 15 Cups
 
      6 c  Flour; sifted
  5 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
  5 1/2 ts Baking soda
      2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
      2 c  Vegetable shortening
 
  Sift dry ingredients together.  Cut in shortening wiht a pastry
  blender or two knives, or you can use your food processor for this
  step.
  
  Store mix in a tightly closed container on the pantry shelf.
  
  Mix will keep for up to 6 months in dry weather.  If the weather is
  hot and humid, keep this mix in the refrigerator.
  
  Note: This mix can be kept handy on the pantry shelf and is very
  convenient for a quick but rich treat. The basic chocolate cake from
  your own mix can be varied by the addition of different kinds of
  icings and fillings. Try spreading 1 cup of fruit preserves between
  the layers before frosting, and sprinkle the top with shredded
  coconut.

      Title: CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH LUCIFER'S NUTS
 Categories: Cake, Mc
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
 
        1    chocolate cake recipe
        1 c  pecan halves (or subsitute
  :          the nut of
  :          your choice)
      1/4 c  water
        2 TB sugar
        1 TB dried Habenero powder (use
  :          your judgment
  :          on this!)
      1/4 ts salt
  
  I used the chocolate cake and chocolate frosting recipes in Lindsey
  Shere's "Chez Panisse Desserts," substituting Lindt Excellence for
  her combination of semisweet and bitter chocolates. (By the way,
  "Chez Panisse Desserts" is an awesome cookbook, now back in print and
  even in paperback!) You could use any chocolate cake recipe you like;
  a very rich and buttery substrate is a good idea at this heat level.
  I then added the following to the batter (reserving a dozen for
  garnishing the top of the iced cake): Over a medium-high heat, stir
  the water and sugar in a small teflon skillet until the sugar is
  disolved. Add the nuts, and stir constantly until the water is mostly
  evaporated (about 3-4 minutes). Add the chile and salt to coat well,
  and stir constantly until the water is gone. Remove the nuts to a
  piece of wax paper, separating the pecan halves from each other with
  a fork if necessary. Let cool, and incorporate them into the cake
  batter just before pouring it into the pan. To make the habenero
  powder, I just put 4 dried habs in the spice grinder, and ground
  until very fine. Let the grinder settle for a couple of minutes
  before trying to remove the powder :-) Using finely powdered dried
  hot peppers of a lesser burn level would be appropriate for the
  non-maniacal chile-head.

  cooking until figs are tender, about 20 minutes.  Set aside.
  
  Grease botton and sides of a round baking pan - 9 inches in diameter
  and 2 inches high - with shortening or vegetable oil. Line the bottom
  with a circle of parchment or aluminum foil. Set aside.
  
  Cut the chocolate into small pieces and melt it with the butter in
  the top of a double boiler.  (I use a microwave). Remove from heat

  Crack the eggs into a large bowl.  Add cocoa and sugar to the eggs
  and beat with an electric mixer until blended evenly. Drain the figs,
  discarding the liquid. Stir figs and chocolate into the egg mixture
  and mix well. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.
  
  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until the cake rises to the top
  of the pan and feels set in the center, about 40 minutes. Let it cool
  in the pan on a wire rack. When cool, turn it out onto a rack. Remove
  the parchment or foil, invert the cake into a large serving plate.
  Cover it and refrigerate until ready to serve. Accompany with whipped
  cream.

  Filling preparation: First, prepare the pie shell. Then, in a large,
  heavy-bottomed saucepan, stir together the sugar and water. Set the
  saucepan over medium-high heat. Let the sugar mixture come to a boil
  and continue to cook until it caramelizes. Do not stir the sugar as
  it cooks. If it caramelizes unevenly, you can move it around by
  swirling it in the pan. When the sugar is a rich golden brown, remove
  it from heat and stir in the butter and evaporated milk gradually,
  mixing well with a wooden spoon until smooth. Let cool for 5 minutes
  and stir in the chocolate. Beat with a whisk until very smooth. Set
  the filling aside to cool for 10-15 minutes and then stir in the
  nuts. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 475'F.
  
  Assembly and baking: Pour the filling into the pie shell and bake for
  10 minutes, until the edge is very brown and the center is bubbling.
  Once the pie has cooled to room temperature, about 1 hour, decorate
  it, if desired, by making small flowers with the whole hazelnuts and
  sliced almonds.
  
  Makes one 9" single-crust pie.

      Title: CHOCOLATE CARAMEL TRUFFLES
 Categories: Candies, Chocolate, Godiva
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
           CARAMEL:
    1/2 c  PLUS 2 TABLESPOONS GRAN --
           ULATED SUGAR
    1/4 c  WATER
    1/4 c  HEAVY CREAM
           GANACHE:
      8 oz BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE --
           COARSELY CHOPPED
    3/4 c  HEAVY CREAM
      1 tb UNSALTED BUTTER -- SOFTENED
      2 tb VANILLA EXTRACT
           CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR
           UNSWEETENED COCOA POWDER
 
  Make the caramel: In a small heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and
  water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar
  dissolves. Then continue to boil, without stirring, 4 to 5 minutes
  longer, or until the syrup caramelizes and turns a deep amber in
  color. Immediately remove the syrup from the heat and add the cream.
  (The mixture will bubble up). Using a wooden spoon, stir until
  completely smooth; if necessary, briefly return the caramel to low
  heat and stir until smooth. Scrape into a small bowl and let cool to
  room temperature. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.
  Make the ganache: Place the chocolate in a food processor fitted with
  the metal blade and process until finely chopped. In a small
  saucepan, over medium heat, bring the cream to a gentle boil. With
  the motor of the food processor running, pour the cream through the
  feed tube. Process for 10 to 15 seconds, until the chocolate is
  completely melted. Using a spatula, scrape down the side of the work
  bowl.
  
  Add the butter and vanilla and process for about 5 seconds, or until
  the mixture is smooth and creamy. Scrape the ganache into a medium
  bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to
  pipe, about 1 hour. Make the caramel centers: Line a small baking
  sheet with waxed paper. Using a 1/4-teaspoon measuring spoon dipped
  in cold water, scoop out level spoonfuls of the caramel and place
  about 1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Freeze until firm, at least
  30 minutes. Form the truffles: Transfer the chilled ganache to a
  pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip (such as Ateco #6). Pipe
  1 1/4-inch mounds with pointed peaks onto a clean baking sheet.
  Refrigerate or freeze the truffles for 10 to 20 minutes, or until
  just firm enough to roll. Sift a light dusting of confectioners'
  sugar over the chilled truffles. Lightly coat the palms and
  fingertips of your hands with confectioners' sugar. With your
  fingertips, pinch a truffle into a round, then roll it gently between
  your palms into a slightly irregularly shaped 1 1/4 inch ball. Place
  the rolled truffle on the baking sheet, and form the remaining
  truffles into rounds. Refrigerate the truffles for about 10 minutes,
  just until firm. Remove the rolled truffles from the refrigerator.
  Remove 5 or 6 of the caramel centers from the freezer and place on a
  cold plate. Working quickly, with your fingertips, pinch a caramel
  center into a small ball. With the tip of your index finger, make an
  indentation about 2/3 of the way through the center of a chocolate
  truffle. Insert the caramel center in the truffle and, with your
  fingertips, mold the chocolate over the caramel,
  
  covering it completely. Place on a baking sheet and repeat the
  procedure with the remaining chocolate truffles and caramel centers.
  Refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. Roll half the chocolate
  truffles in sifted confectioners' sugar to coat. Roll the remaining
  truffles in sifted cocoa powder to coat. Store the truffles for up to
  5 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Remove from the
  refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. ~ Judith Sutton

  Author's Notes: You may have seen this on the cover of a recent
  magazine when you were standing in the grocery line. It makes a very
  rich, truly decadent chocolate cheesecake. A chocolate wafer is a
  crisp chocolate cookie about three inches in diameter and an eigth of
  an inch thick. If you can't find them, you can substitute any kind of
  dry crunchy chocolate-flavored cookie. You can make the crust and
  filling in a food processor if you have one. It makes it a lot easier.
  
  Difficulty    : moderate. Precision
  : measure carefully.

      Title: CHOCOLATE CHERRY TORTE 02
 Categories: Holidays, Cakes, Chocolate
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           Part two
 
  7. To assemble torte, using the bottom of a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan as a
  pattern, cut chocolate cake into three 9 by 5-inch rectangles; use
  leftover cake trimmings for snacking. Line the inside of the loaf pan
  with plastic wrap, allowing 2 inches to extend over the sides so
  assembled torte can be easily removed from pan.
  
  8. Place one cake rectangle in bottom of pan; brush generously with
  some Coffee Syrup. Spread half of cheese filling on top of cake in
  pan. Place another cake rectangle atop filling; brush with Coffee
  Syrup and top with cherry filling. Place remaining cake atop cherry
  filling; brush with remaining Coffee Syrup and top with remaining
  cheese filling, spreading smoothly as this will be top of torte.
  Cover torte with overhanging plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4
  hours or overnight. Prepare Chocolate Meringue Twigs.
  
  9. To serve, remove torte from pan by pulling up plastic wrap on all
  sides. Place torte on serving plate and gently pull plastic wrap to
  remove from underneath. Gently press flat sides of chocolate twigs
  upright onto sides of torte to cover completely. If desired, tie
  ribbon around sides of torte, ending in a bow in the center of one
  long side. Top torte with fresh cherries, if desired, and serve. Or
  refrigerate up to 2 hours before serving. (Twigs will eventually
  soften with refrigeration.)
  
  Chocolate Meringue Twigs: Heat oven to 275'F. Line 2 large baking
  sheets with parchment paper (if not available, use aluminum foil and
  grease lightly). Place 1/2 C sugar and 2 large egg whites in
  medium-size bowl. Set the bowl in a larger bowl of very hot, not
  boiling, water. With portable electric mixer at high speed, beat
  mixture until thick and nearly double in volume. Remove bowl from hot
  water and continue beating egg whites until very stiff peaks
  form-about 4 minutes. Sift 2 T unsweetened cocoa powder over meringue
  and fold in until blended. Transfer chocolate meringue to pastry bag
  fitted with a 3/8-inch round tip. Making narrow rows, pipe 3 to
  4-inch long "twigs" of meringue onto baking sheets. Bake meringue
  twigs 1 1/2 hours or until dry and firm. Cool twigs completely on
  baking sheets on wire racks. Meanwhile, melt 1 1/2 oz bittersweet
  chocolate in microwave or in bowl set over simmering water. Dip fork
  in melted chocolate and quickly move it back and forth across twigs,
  creating thin chocolate stripes. Refrigerate twigs just until
  chocolate stripes harden-about 5 minutes. Gently remove twigs from
  parchment and store in airtight container, unrefrigerated, until
  ready to use.

  This is untested.  For my Hitachi I would probably use less water
  than this original recipe calls for.
  
  Important to check the dough while kneading to see if additional
  flour may be needed!!!
  
  Depending on machine either your loaf will come out with most of the
  chocolate chips whole, of if your bread machine warms up during
  kneading and rising, the chocolate chips will melt to produce a
  chocolate dough.
  
  Have all ingredients at room temperature.  Add ingredients in the
  order specified by your machine. Add chocolate chips at the
  appropriate moment for your machine. Set bread machine on basic bread
  making setting. If possible use light baking cycle, if not use normal
  setting.

           Pillsbury Chocolate Chip
           - Cookie Dough (large size)
           - OR homemade cookie dough
 
  Take the chocolate cookie dough out of fridge and leave out till
  needed. Scald milk until bubbles form around edge. Remove from heat.
  Add sugar and salt. Stir until dissolved. Stir in half and half,
  vanilla, and whipping cream. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Freeze
  as directed by your ice cream machine's instructions. Once ice cream
  has been through the entire ice cream machine process and is now a
  chilled soft ice cream, add the chocolate chip cookie dough. Just
  break up the dough as best you can with your hands and drop it in
  small clusters into the soft ice cream. Try to mix it around to
  ensure that the cookie dough is evenly distributed throughout the ice
  cream. Put the ice cream in the freezer for several hours until
  hardened. Origin: We pretty much took our vanilla ice cream recipe
  and added the chocolate chip cookie dough. You can easily use the
  Pillsbury cookie dough, but it's cheaper and better to use homemade.
  Our Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough recipe makes this
  especially yummy!

      4    12-oz  bags semi-sweet real
           Chocolate chips
           * be sure to use fresh
           Nuts*
 
  Combine flour, baking soda, salt and both sugars in very large bowl.
  Mix in the shortening with your fingers. Stir in the chips and nuts.
  Store whole mix in airtight container in a cool dry place for up to
  six months. For longer storage refrigerate or freeze. **I package the
  mix in individual zip-lock bags. TO MAKE THE COOKIES: Stir the mix to
  distribute the nuts and chips and then, measure seven level cups of
  the mix into a large bowl. (* spoon in and level, do not pack) Stir
  to distribute the nuts and chips. Add two large eggs that have been
  lightly beaten and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Blend well. This
  creates a heavy batter, but don't worry it will work. Drop the batter
  by tablespoonfuls on buttered baking sheets. Bake in preheated 375
  oven for 10 - 12 minutes. Cool slightly on sheets and then transfer
  to an airtight container. One batch makes about 2 dozen cookies.

 Categories: Chocolate, Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    115 g  Flour
      2 ml Salt
  2 1/2 ml Baking soda
    100 g  Butter, softened (1 stick)
     60 g  White sugar
     60 g  Brown sugar
  2 1/2 ml Vanilla extract
      1 lg Egg
    175 g  Nestle's chocolate chips (1
           Package)
 
  1.  Preheat oven to 190 øC . Sift flour, salt, baking soda together
  in a small bowl.
  
  2.  In another bowl, mix butter with two sugars, vanilla and egg until
  smooth. gradually mix dry stuff in with butter mixture. Mix in
  chocolate chips.
  
  3.  Put blobs of dough on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 190 øC for
  8-10 minutes.
  
  Author's Notes: There is no substitute for chocolate-chip cookies,
  warm out of the oven, washed down with cold milk. This is Mom's
  recipe, and Mom's Mom's recipe. This is also Nestle's ``TollHouse''
  recipe, and the Joy of Cooking ``Chocolate-Chip Drop Cookies''
  recipe, etc, which is no coincidence. This is the default recipe.
  This is not Mrs. Field's recipe. If youwant Mrs. Field's, use a
  shopping mall; if you want simple, elegant, timeless chocolate-chip
  cookies, use this recipe.
  
  Important: double all proportions above (always make 2x as much of
  these as the recipe calls for). Let's face it: small is beautiful,
  but big cookies are better than small ones. All the printed recipes
  call for teeny cookies, dropped by teaspoonsful onto cookie sheets
  (yield 50). My ``blobs of dough'' are golf-ball sized, which makes
  healthy 3-4 inch cookies. I invariably make these on the spur of the
  moment, and so usually nuke the butter in a microwave to soften it
  up. I also occasionally cheat and soften up the butter/sugar mixture
  a tad in the oven. Try adding walnuts, macadamias, white chocolate,
  orange peel, butterscotch chips, or mint - all these are welcome
  variations. But keep it simple.
  
  Difficulty    : easy to moderate. Precision
  : measure the ingredients.

  Why bake cookies on a stick?  For no reason but fun and to give them a
  festive look. Presented in a florist's box, they're bound to evoke a
  smile.
  
  In a bowl, cream butter and both sugars with a mixer. Beat in egg and
  vanilla.  Mix together flour, baking soda, baking powder and oats.
  Blend with butter mixture. Stir in chocolate.
  
  Shape dough into 24 walnut-size balls.  Assemble 1 at a time on an
  oiled 12x15 inch baking sheet. Set ball at 1 of the narrow ends,
  insert a dowel into center of ball, then pat dough into 2-1/2 inch
  round; keep dowel in center of round and covered by dough. Repeat,
  placing rounds about 2 inches apart. At opposite end of sheet, center
  dough between dowels (-> see diagram below).
   A pan holds 5 or 6 cookies. Keep dough covered until ready to shape.
  
  Bake cookies in a 375~ oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes (if
  using 1 oven, alternate pan positions after 8 minutes). slide a
  spatula under each cooky to release from pan; leave in place for 5
  minutes. Then carefully lay cookies with dowels flat on racks
  (supprted the full length on racks of equal height) until cool.
  
  To wrap, enclose each cooky with plastic wrap and tie wrap to dowel
  with a ribbon (green for 'leaves') to keep cooky airtight. Serve, or
  store wrapped cookies up to 3 days at room temperature. Freeze to
  store longer.
  
  Makes 24 cookies.

  Who else besides hillary Clinton uses vegetable shortening in
  chocolate chip cookies? Thersa Monk and her 12-year-old daughter,
  Krystal, of Germantown, MD., for two.
  
  At least now. For years, the Monks used butter in their baking, but
  when they saw an opportunity to compete in the Crisco American Baking
  Celbration, they couldn't resist trying to concoct a recipe with
  butter flavored Crisco.
  
  The result: Chocolate Chip Macadamia Crunch Cookies, which won the
  national $500 prize in the chocolate chip cookie contest in late
  March.
  
  *****
  
  With an electric mixer, beat shortening, sugar, brown sugar, eggs,
  vanilla and buttermilk for 3-5 minutes until very light and fluffy.
  In a separate bowl, mix the flour, oatmeal, baking soda and salt. By
  hand, add the shortening mixture and stir well. Add chocolate chips
  and nuts and stir by hand.
  
  Refrigerate for at least a half hour until the dough is firm. Drop
  dough by the tablespoon, about 2" apart, onto a greased insulated
  cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 325'F. oven for 16-18 minutes until
  the cookies are a light golden brown.
  
  Cool cookies on baking sheet for a minute and then remove to cooling
  rack.

      Title: CHOCOLATE CHIP MUFFINS
 Categories: Muffins, Net
      Yield: 12 Muffins
 
    3/4 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Butter, melted
      1    Egg
  1 3/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
    1/3 c  Brown sugar, packed
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Chocolate chips, semisweet
    1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
 
  Heat oven to 400 degrees F.; line 12 medium muffin cups with paper
  baking cups or grease bottoms only of muffin cups.
  
  Beat milk, margarine and egg.  Stir in remaining ingredients, all at
  once, just until flour is moistened (batter will be lumpy). Fill
  muffin cups about 2/3 full. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until golden
  brown.
  
  Her notes:
  
  *  I don't use paper baking cups. I spray with Pam only the bottoms
  of the muffin depressions in the pan. I always increase the amount of
  chocolate chips and nuts a little because I like them and I usually
  think recipes are chintzy with them.
  
  *  Use a fork to loosen them and tip them up in the pan as soon as
  they come out of the oven. That way you'll get a crisper crust on the
  bottom and sides.

  RE: Chocolate Chip Cookies DATE: 04-26-91 AREA: COOKING
  
  Just received a new publication:  THE COOKS BOOKSHELF catalog: "The
  Finest Collections of American Cooking"
    It is a catalog of "traditional" cookbooks,  many of the community
  variety.   (p.o. box 9802-821, Austin, TX 78766). Has lots of neat
  cookbooks.  The catalog published the following recipe from the
  cookbook "Chockful O' Chips, A Collection of Chocolate Chip Recipes"
  by Peggy Seeman.
  
  With the spate of "Mrs. Fields"  and "Niemen Marcus" $250 chocolate
  chip cookie recipes, I thought someone might want to try the
  following. It does sound good. The author insists that you don't make
  substitutions and gives brand names.  Makes it sound authentic,
  doesn't it.

  Preheat oven to 350.
  
  DO NOT SUBSTITUTE INGREDIENTS (says the author)
  
  Cream together with electric mixer until fluffy the sugars,
  shortening, eggs, vanilla and milk.
  
  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt and
  gradually add to creamed mixture.  Mix well with a spoon. Do not use
  electric mixer.
  
  Stir in chocolate chips, oatmeal and pecans.
  
  Drop by teaspoonfuls on lightly greased cooking sheet. Bake for 12-15
  minutes.  DO NOT OVERBAKE.  (The key to these cookies turning out
  well is mixing the wet ingredients thoroughly until light and fluffy
  and in not overbaking)

 Categories: Scones, Chocolate
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    All-purpose flour
    1/3    Granulated sugar
      2    Baking powder
    1/2    Salt
    1/2    Unsalted butter; chilled
      2    Eggs
    1/4    Orange juice
      1    Vanilla extract
    1/2    Orange peel; grated
    3/4    Miniature chocolate chips
      1    Egg white; mixed with
    1/2    Water; for glaze, optional
 
    Recipe by: American Country Inn and Bed & Breakfast
         Preheat oven to 400 degrees; butter a 9-inch
    circle in the center of a baking sheet.  In a large
    bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder
    and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and
    distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry
    blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in
    the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
    In a small bowl, stir together the eggs, orange juice,
    vanilla extract and orange peel.  Add to the flour
    mixture and stir to combine. The dough will be sticky.
    With lightly floured hands, knead in the chocolate
    chips until they are evenly distributed.  With lightly
    floured hands, pat the dough into an 8-inch circle in
    the center of the baking sheet. If desired, brush the
    egg white mixture over the tops and sides of the
    dough. With a serrated knife, cut the dough into 8
    wedges. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a
    toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
    Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool for 10
    minutes. With a spatula, transfer the scones to a wire
    rack to cool. Recut into wedges if necessary. Serve
    warm or cool completely and store in an air-tight
    container.
     These scones freeze well.   Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).

      Yield: 24 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/8 ts Double acting baking powder
    1/8 ts Salt
     14 oz Semisweet chocolate --
           Finely chopped
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      9 tb Unsalted butter -- cut
           Tablespoons
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
    1/4 c  Water
      3 lg Eggs -- chilled
      1 tb Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 c  Coarsely chopped walnut --
           Halves, divided
      9 oz Swiss dark chocolate -- cut
           Inch chunks -- divided
 
  Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees
  F. Line a 13-by-9 1/2-inch baking pan with a double thickness of
  aluminum foil so that the foil extends 2 inches beyond the two short
  ends of the pan. Fold the overhang down along the sides of the pan.
  Butter the bottom of the foil-lined pan. In a medium bowl, stir
  together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Place the
  semisweet chocolate in a large bowl. In a medium saucepan, combine
  the sugar, butter, corn syrup and water. Cook over medium heat,
  stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the butter melts, the
  sugar is dissolved and the mixture comes to a boil. Remove the pan
  from the heat and pour the hot syrup over the chocolate. Let the
  mixture stand for 1 to 2 minutes, to melt the chocolate. Whisk until
  smooth. One at a time, whisk in the eggs, blending until smooth.
  Whisk in the vanilla and the flour mixture, mixing until the batter
  is smooth. Using a rubber spatula, fold in 1 cup of the walnuts and 6
  ounces of the Swiss chocolate chunks. Scrape the batter into the
  prepared pan and spread it evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the
  remaining 1/2 cup of walnuts and 3 ounces of chocolate chunks over
  the top of the batter. Bake the brownies for 40 to 50 minutes, or
  until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the
  brownie comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Cool the
  brownies in the pan set on a wire rack. When the brownies are
  completely cool, cover the pan of brownies with plastic wrap and let
  the brownies set at room temperature for at least 6 hours or
  overnight. Invert the brownies onto a large plate or cutting board.
  Remove the pan and carefully peel off the foil. Invert again onto a
  smooth cutting surface and cut into 24 bars. Store the brownies at
  room temperature in an airtight container for up to five days.

      1 pk Active dry yeast OR;
      1 tb Active dry yeast, bulk
    1/4 c  Warm water (110-115F)
    1/2 c  Milk, lukewarm (scald, then
           -cool to lukewarm)
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Shortening
      1    Egg, large
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Cocoa
  2 1/4 c  Flour, unbleached
      2 tb Margarine or butter,
           -softened
    1/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground

MMMMM------------------POWDERED SUGAR FROSTING-----------------------
      1 c  Powdered sugar, sifted
      1 tb Milk
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl. Stir in the
  milk, 1/4 c. of the sugar, the shortening, egg and salt. Mix the
  cocoa with the one and one quarter cup of the flour and add to the y
  east mixture. Mix with a spoon until smooth.  Mix in enough of the
  remaining flour to make the dough easy to handle, but still slightly
  sticky and soft. Turn out on a lightly floured board and knead until
  smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Let the dough rest while you
  wash the mixing bowl, dry and grease it with shortening.  Put the
  dough into the bowl, turning to grease the top. (At this point, the
  dough can be covered and refrigerated 3-4 days, punching it down when
  it gets too big for the bowl.) Cover and let rise in a warm place
  until double, about 1-1/2 hrs. (Dough is ready when an indentation
  remains when touched.) Punch the dough down and roll into a rectangle
  12/9 inches. Spread the rectangle with the softened margarine and mix
  the 1/4 c. of sugar and the cinnamon together, sprinkling it over the
  buttered dough when done.  Rull up, beginning at the 12-in. side and
  when fully rolled up, pinch the seam to seal.  Cut the roll into 12
  slices and place slightly apart in a baking pan 9x9x2 inches. (For
  larger rolls, place in 13x9x2 in. pan and let rise until it fills the
  pan.) Cover and let rise until double, about 40 minutes.  Heat the
  oven to 375F. Bake 25-30 minutes. Spread with powdered sugar frosting
  while still warm. Mix frosting ingredients together until reaching a
  spreading consistency. Makes enough frosting for 12 rolls. (Increase
  amounts for larger rolls.)

      Title: CHOCOLATE COFFEE CREAM ROLL
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      5 lg Eggs, separated
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Plus 2 tb unsweetened cocoa
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking powder
           Coffee Cream Filling
  1 1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Cold water
      3    Egg yolks
      1 ts Unflavored gelatin
      2 tb Instant coffee powder
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  Rich and delectable, this showy dessert makes an elegant finale to any
  dinner. The coffee and cream flavors are the perfect complement to the
  chocolate sponge roll.
  
  1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400
  degrees F. Lightly grease a 17-by-11-inch jelly roll pan. Line with
  waxed paper and grease and lightly flour the paper.
  
  2. Prepare the chocolate roll. Melt the butter in a small pan and let
  it cool slightly. In a medium-sized bowl stir together the flour, 1/3
  cup of the cocoa, and the baking powder.
  
  3. In another medium-size bowl whisk together the 5 egg yolks, 1/4
  cup of the sugar, and the melted butter until light, about 1 minute.
  Whisk in the vanilla. With a spoon, stir in about half of the dry
  ingredients.
  
  4. In a large, deep bowl combine the egg whites and salt; with an
  electric mixer, beat until soft peaks just begin to form. Gradually
  beat in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, beating just until stiff, glossy
  peaks form.
  
  5. Fold about one-fourth (or a large spoonful) of the egg whites into
  the egg yolk mixture to lighten. Turn this mixture into the bowl of
  egg whites and partially fold together. Sift the remaining dry
  ingredients over the top and quickly and gently but thoroughly fold
  together until no streaks remain. Quickly spread in the prepared pan
  and bake 10 to 12 minutes, just until the center top springs back
  when lightly touched.
  
  6. Sift the remaining 2 tablespoons of cocoa onto a clean kitchen
  towel. Invert the cake onto it and peel off the paper (if it has
  stuck or is stubborn, lightly brush the paper with water before
  peeling off). With a long, sharp knife or a serrated knife, trim away
  about 1/2 inch from each edge. Start along one long side, roll up,
  jelly roll fashion. Wrap in the towel and let cool to room
  temperature.
  
  7. While roll cools, prepare the coffee cream. In a medium-sized
  saucepan over low heat, scald the milk until tiny bubbles appear
  around the edges of the surface. Place 1 tablespoon cold water in a
  cup and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Let soften until needed.
  
  8. In a medium-sized bowl stir together the sugar, flour, and salt.
  Gradually whisk in the scalded milk. Place in a heavy medium-sized
  saucepan over moderately low heat and, stirring constantly, cook
  until the mixture thickens and comes to a simmer. Whisk in the egg
  yolks and continue cooking and stirring until the mixture comes to a
  boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the coffee powder and
  dissolved gelatin until smooth; stir in the vanilla. Turn into a
  shallow bowl, cover with plastic wrap or waxed paper placed directly
  on the surface, and cool just to room temperature.
  
  9. Assemble the roll. Using chilled bowl and beaters, whip the cream
  until stiff. Give the coffee cream filling a good stir and fold in
  about one-fourth of the whipped cream to lighten. Turn the lightened
  coffee filling into the whipped cream and fold together.
  
  10. Carefully unroll the chocolate cake onto a board. Spread all of
  the coffee cream over it, making it thicker along the side where you
  will begin to reroll and leaving about 1 inch uncoated along the
  other long side. Reroll the chocolate cake to enclose the filling.
  Leave it on the board, seam side down, cover, and chill until set, at
  least 4 hours or overnight. Trim the ends and cut into slices. Serve
  cold.

   1742 lg Ants, (if they are sm.,

      3 c  Melted chocolate
 
  Catch ants at a picnic site and keep them in a glass jar to which you
  have added a teaspoon of sugar to keep them happy. (Unhappy ants are
  liable to go sour before processing.) At home, pick up each ant with
  tweezers and remove entrails with a small, very sharp knife edge.
  This will take about 400 hours.  If you are in a hurry, eliminate
  this step; you'll never know the difference. Dip each ant into melted
  chocolate and place to drain on waxed paper.  If any of them are
  still able to crawl off the paper, let them go -- be a good sport!!

      Title: CHOCOLATE COVERED CANDIED CHERRIES
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     50    Whole candied cherries
    3/4 c  Cherry brandy
    1/2 lb Sweet milk chocolate, broken
           -into pieces
    1/4 lb Unsweetened baking
           -chocolate, broken into
           -pieces
  1 1/3 c  Powdered sugar
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
           Powdered sugar
           Unsweetened cocoa
 
  Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer. Drain cherries,
  reserve the brandy.
  
  Cream butter and sugar with a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
  chocolates. Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the
  butter and sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.
  
  Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir in my hand
  until all is absorbed.  Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.
  
  Put mixture in a clean bowl and thoroughly chill in the freezer.
  Meanwhile, make a 50-50 mixture of powdered sugar and cocoa. Begin
  with 1/3 c. EACH and mix thoroughly. Heavily dust a sheet of waxed
  paper on a working surface.
  
  When the chocolate mixture is chilled and very stiff, remove from the
  freezer. Drop by teaspoonfuls on dusted working surface and dust your
  fingers in the sugar/cocoa mixture, press with fingers to make a
  small flat shape with the chocolate.  Drop a cherry in the center and
  form a ball around the cherry.
  
  Working quickly, complete the shape by rolling the ball between your
  palms.
  
  Roll ball in sugar/cocoa mixture to coat.  Continue working until the
  chocolate mixture is too soft to continue. Return to freezer to chill
  some more and continue until all the chocolate and cherries are gone.
  
  The chocolate covered cherries can be stored in the frig.
  
  For a lighter, sweeter chocolate taste, increase the sweet chocolate
  and decrease or eliminate the unsweetened chocolate. The more milk
  chocolate you use, the more diffucult it will be to work with as it
  melts rather rapidly.
  
  You can also substitute and equal portion of semi-sweet bits (toll
  house chocolates) for the chocolate.
  
  Other candied fruit and liquors can be used according to your taste.
  
  Enjoy!

 Categories: Desserts, Australia
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Copha
      8 oz Icing sugar
  3 1/2 ts Cocoa
      5 c  Rice Bubbles
    1/2 c  Sultanas (optional)
 
  Combine sifted icing sugar, cocoa, rice bubbles and optional
  sultanas. Melt copha and add to ingredients and mix thoroughly. Spoon
  into paper cups and allow to set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A traditional Australian sweet snack -- Mention this recipe to an
  Australian abroad and he will instantly get homesick. Yield: serves 6.
  
  *  Rice Bubbles are called Rice Krispies in North America. Icing
  sugar is confectioner's sugar. Sultanas are like raisins. Copha, it
  would appear, is utterly unavailable outside Australia. It is a
  partially-solidified shortening made of coconut oil.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you can get the ingredients.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Slivered almonds
  2 1/4 c  Heavy cream,, cold
      3 lg Egg whites
    1/3 c  Confectioners' sugar
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
    3/4 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
      6 oz Bittersweet
      7 oz Semisweet chocolate,
           -chocolate, grated
           - or shaved chopped into
           -curls,, for
           -garnish(optional)
      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate,,
           -chopped
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread the almonds on a cookie sheet and
  toast in the oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool.
  Turn the oven down to 275 degrees. Butter the bottom and sides (not
  the lip) of a 9-inch glass pie plate. Place the egg whites in a bowl
  of an electric mixer and set over a pan of hot tap water until
  slightly warmed. Then whisk the warm egg whites until soft peaks
  form. Whisk in the cream of tartar and then add the granulated sugar
  in a slow, steady, stream, whisking continuously. Continue whisking
  until stiff and glossy, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Make a pie shell
  with the meringue by smoothing it over the bottom and sides of the
  buttered pie plate. Bake until slightly crisp and dry, 15 minutes.
  Cool on a rack.
  
  Combine the two chocolates in a bowl over simmering water, and stir
  occasionally until melted. Let cool to room temperature. Combine the
  heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, cinnamon and vanilla in a mixing
  bowl. Beat at medium speed until very soft peaks form, 2 to 3
  minutes. Stir one third of the cream into the melted chocolates to
  lighten. Then add that mixture to the whipped cream and fold in until
  completely incorporated. Scatter half of the toasted almonds over the
  cooked meringue shell. Top with the chocolate cream filling,
  smoothing the top. Decorate the top with the remaining toasted
  almonds and grated chocolate or chocolate curls, if desired. Cover
  and refrigerate at least one hour before serving.

 Categories: Muffins, Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------CRUMBLE MIXTURE---------------------------
      2 oz Ghirardelli Sweet Dark
           -Chocolate
      2 tb Packed brown sugar
    1/2 ts Grated fresh orange rind
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Instant coffee
      1 tb Cold butter
    1/4 c  Pecans

MMMMM--------------------COFFEE CAKE MIXTURE-------------------------
  1 3/4 c  Unsifted flour
    2/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Cold butter
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Half & half
      1    Egg yolk
      2 ts Water
 
  Servings: 12
  
  DIRECTIONS: Crumble mixture: Place pieces of broken chocolate and
  brown sugar in food processor or blender. Process about 15 to 20
  seconds or until as fine as coarse ground coffee. Add orange rind,
  cinnamon, coffee, butter and pecans. Process a short time until nuts
  are finely chopped. Set aside.
  
  Coffee Cake: Place flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in food
  processor; process for a few seconds to combine or prepare by hand
  using a pastry blender. Sprinkle small butter cubes over dry
  ingredients. Process only 5-6 seconds to distribute butter into very
  small pieces, or use pastry blender. Transfer to a bowl. Spread
  mixture to form a well in the center. Beat whole egg lightly with
  half & half. Pour, all at once, into dry ingredients. Using a folding
  motion, stir to combine ingredients- mixing only until liquid is all
  absorbed. (Do not overmix. This should take only 15-20 hand strokes.)
  Sprinkle the crumble mixture over dough in bowl. With a table knife,
  draw across in 2 directions to marble crumble with dough. (Do not
  combine thoroughly.) Heavily grease cups of muffin pans, disposable
  foil pans, glass custard cups or cupcake liners. When portioning
  dough, mixture will be rough but will come together after baking. To
  make large size muffins, fill cups level to top, yielding 9 muffins.
  For medium muffins, fill cups 2/3 full, yielding 12 muffins. Prepare
  egg wash by mixing water with egg yolk. Brush muffins with egg wash.
  Bake at 400-F for 15-17 minutes, depending upon the size of the
  muffins. Muffins should be golden brown and baked in the center. Cool
  in pans about 5 minutes to firm muffins before removing. Serve warm.

  HERSHEY'S Milk Chocolate Bar, SPECIAL DARK Bar or HERSHEY'S
  Unsweetened Baking Chocolate
  
  The secret to successful curls is chocolate at the proper temperature,
  slightly warm but still firm. On a warm day, room temperature might be
  fine. Place unwrapped chocolate bar on cookie sheet. Place in cooled
  oven until warm. (Or place in microwave oven on HIGH (100%) 30
  seconds or just until chocolate feel slightly warm) With even
  pressure, draw vegetable peeler along underside of chocolate; a curl
  will form.. Use wooden pick to lift curl onto wax paper-covered tray.
  Refrigerate until firm. Use side of b ar for narrow curls. Use width
  of one or tow blocks for medium-size curls. Use entire width of bar
  of large curls.
  
  NOTE: Chocolate curls can be refrigerated in covered container and
  stored for later use.

MMMMM--------------------BITTERSWEET GANACHE-------------------------
      2 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Sugar
      8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
 
  Combine the raisins and whiskey in a plastic container with a tight
  fitting lid. Allow to stand at room temperature for 6 hours or
  overnight. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler
  over medium heat. Place 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, 1/2 cup heavy
  cream, and 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate in the top half of the
  double boiler. Tightly cover the top with ilm wrap. Heat for 10
  minutes, then remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Transfer to
  a stainless steel bowl and set aside until needed. Heat the remaining
  1 1/2 c heavy cream and the half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt. saucepan
  over medium-high heat. Bring the cream to a boil. While the cream is
  heating, place 8 egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar in the bowl of an
  electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the eggs on high for 2 to 2
  1/2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Continue to beat on
  high until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, about 2 1/2 to 3
  minutes. (At this point, the cream should be boiling. If not, adjust
  the mixer speed to low and continue to mix until the cream boils. If
  this is not done, the egg yolks will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour
  the boiling cream into the beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine.
  Return to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat, stirring
  constantly, until the cream reaches a temperature of 185~, 2-4
  minutes. Then pour into the melted chocolate mixture, and stir to
  combine. Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath to a temperature of
  40-45~, about 15-20 minutes. Line 2, 8" cake pans with enough film
  wrap to cover the insides of the pan. Set aside until needed. Fold
  the whiskey-soaked raisins and any residual liquid into the cooled
  chocolate custard mixture. Freeze in an ice cream freezer following

      Title: CHOCOLATE DEVASTATION (PART 2)
 Categories: Ice cream, Chocolate
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           - directions continued
 
  MOCHA MERINGUE: Using a 9" cake circle (or cake plate) as a guide,
  trace a circle on each of 3 sheets of parchment paper (cut to fit the
  baking sheets) with a pencil. Turn each sheet of parchment paper over
  and place with the trace mark down on a baking sheet. Preheat the
  oven to 250~. Combine together in a sifter the confectioners' sugar,
  cornstarch, and cocoa. Sift onto the wax paper and set aside until
  needed. Heat 1" of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over
  medium-high heat. Place 8 egg whites, 3/4 cup sugar, the espresso
  powder, the cream of tartar, and the salt in the top half of the
  double boiler. Heat the egg white mixture to a temperature of 120~
  while gently and constantly whisking, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer the
  mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon whip.
  Whisk on high until stiff but not dry, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.
  Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in
  the sifted dry ingredients. Fill a pastry bag (with no tip) with
  about a third of the meringue. Fill a traced circle with meringue:
  start in the center and pipe a 1/2" wide spiral toward the ouside of
  the circle. Fill the pastry bag again and repeat this procedure with
  each of the 2 remaining circles (each circle should be filled with
  about a third of the original amount of meringue.) Place the
  meringues in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour. Reduce the oven
  temperature to 225~ and bake for an additional 2 hours. Cool on
  baking sheets for 30 minutes before handling.
    THE GANACHE: Heat 2 cups heavy cream, the butter, and 2 tablespoons
  sugar in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir
  to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. Place 8 oz
  semi-sweet chocolate and 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate in a
  stainless bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow
  to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Reserve 1 cup of ganache
  and set aside at room temperature. Pour the remaining amount of
  ganache onto a baking sheet with sides and refrigerate for 35-40
  minutes. Pour 1/4 cup of the reserved room-temperature ganache onto
  the center of a baked meringue (supported by a cake circle). Remove
  an ice-cream disk from the freezer. Unwrap the disk and place it onto
  the puddle of ganache. Press down on the ice cream disk gently but
  firmly (this will spread the ganache). Fill a pastry bag fitted with
  a medium-sized star tip with one-third of the chilled ganache. Pipe
  about 28-30 individual vertical strips 1 1/2" long and 3/4" wide--all
  the way around the side of the ice cream disk (each strip should be
  touching the other, and each strip should also be wider at the base
  where it touches the meringue and tapered at the crest where it rises
  to the top edge of the ice cream disk). Place this section into the
  freezer and repeat the preceding procedure with another meringue and
  ice cream disk. Place in the freezer after completion for about 10-15
  minutes. Remove a meringue and ice cream section from the freezer.
  Pour 1/4 cup of room-temperature ganache onto the center of the ice
  cream. Remove the second section from the freezer, and center onto
  the first. Press down on the ice cream, gently but firmly, to spread
  the ganache. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup of room-temperature genache
  onto the top ice cream disk, and onto this ganache place the
  remaining baked meringue, once again pressing down gently but firmly
  to spread the ganache. Place the Devastation in the freezer for about
  10-15 minutes. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium-sized star tip
  with the remaining chilled ganache. Remove the Devastation from the
  freezer. Starting 1/2" inside the edge of the top meringue, pipe a
  ring of about 28-30 individual strips--1 1/2" long and 3/4" wide--all
  the way around the top (each strip should be touching the other, and
  each strip should also be wider at the point closest to the edge and
  tapered at the point closest to the center). Return the completed
  Devastation to the freezer for at least 1 hour before serving. To
  serve, cut the Devastation with a serrated slicer. Heat the blade of
  the slicer under hot running water before making each slice. Allow
  the slices to come

  chocolate or they will blacken--use a fork to lower them into the
  chocolate & then to remove them. The chocolate dipped fruits are >>
  gorgeous as they are but sometimes I melt some white chocolate and
  put it into a pastry bag with a tiny, plain tip and swirl some white
  chocolate over the dark chocolate for an even more dramatic effect.

  in a stainless steel bowl. Stir the mixture until smooth. Gently fold
  in the almonds until coated with the batter. Hold the batter at room
  temperature for 20 minutes before using, stirring occasionally. This
  is done in order to dissolve the sugar. If this step is bypassed, the
  cookies will not have the desired taste and texture.

  often, until chocolate melts. Remove from heat. Add confectioners'
  sugar, Karo, creme de cacao, water, and vanilla, and stir until

  Cr#pes:  Combine flour, cocoa, sugar, and salt.  Add milk and almond
  extract; beat until smooth.  Add egg and beat well; stir in butter.
  Refrigerate 2 hours.
  
  Brush bottom of a 6" cr#pe pan or heavy skillet with oil; place over
  medium heat until just hot, not smoking.
  
  Pour 2 tablespoons batter into pan; quickly tilt pan in all
  directions so batter covers the pan in a thin film. Cook 1 minute or

  container. Cover with a damp cloth, then cover the container. Get out
  as needed and knead a little before using. Shape into egg shapes and

      1 lb Tea biscuits

      3 tb Liqueur (chocolate

      3 tb Brandy

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
      4 oz Chocolate, bittersweet
      4 oz Chocolate, milk
 
  Arrange a layer of biscuits at the bottom of a large baking pan.
  
  Mix the brandy and liqueur in a small container and pour on top of the
  biscuits.  Whip the cream, milk, pudding and salt until the mixture is
  thick. Pour the mixture on top of the biscuits. Chill well. When the
  cream is cold, prepare the frosting by grating the chocolate onto the
  top of the cake. Refrigerate before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A no-bake chocolate cake -- This is a very simple, quick, no-bake
  cake for those of us who hate getting near an oven, but like
  delightful cheese cakes. This recipe is originally from the _Yediot
  Achronot_ (Latest News) newspaper supplement here in Israel. It
  should be prepared a day or two before you intend to eat it, so that
  the flavoring fills out. Definitely not for people on a diet. Yield:
  Serves 6-8.
  
  *  You can replace the milk and cream with about 1 1/2 lb of 9
  percent milk fat cheese.  This is a product sold in Israel. The
  nearest equivalent in North America is sour cream. If you do this,
  replace the pudding with about 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup. If you are
  not a chocolate lover, you may replace the chocolate pudding with
  vanilla pudding (or with vanilla extract if you are using the 9
  percent cheese)
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  Add marshmallows and stir until marshmallows are melted and mixture is
  smooth.  Pour mixture into prepared pan.
  
  The mixture is very stringy but after it sits for a few hours (fudging
  process) it gets the fudge consistency.

      Title: CHOCOLATE FUDGE CAKE
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
      Yield: 9 Servings
 
      1 lb Milk chocolate
    1/2 lb Semisweet or
           -extra-bittersweet chocolate
    3/4 lb Softened butter
           FUDGE CAKE
      3 c  Cake flour
      2 c  Light-brown sugar
  2 1/4 ts Baking powder
    3/4 ts Baking soda
    3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      6 oz Softened butter
 
  MILK CHOCOLATE FROSTING
  
  PREPARATION:  FROSTING.  Chop both chocolates into coarse bits and
  melt in a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water. Stir
  occasionally until completely melted.  Remove pan from hot water and
  allow the chocolate to cool until just no longer warm to the touch,
  about 20 minutes. Place the butter in a bowl and beat in the cooled
  chocolate until the mixture is evenly blended, about 3 minutes.
  Frosting can be stored at a cool temperature for up to 3 days, or
  several months in the freezer. Heat the oven to 350F. Butter two
  9-inch round cake pans and line them with buttered and floured
  parchment paper or waxed paper.
  
  FUDGE CAKE.  Sift the flour.  Measure 3 cups.  In a large bowl, mixx
  together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt,
  breaking up any lumps of sugar. In a small bowl, whisk about 1/2 cup
  of the milk with the eggs and vanilla; set aside. Chop the chocolate
  into coarse bits and melt in a double boiler set over hot (not
  boiling) water. Combine the remaining cup of milk and the butter with
  the mixed dry ingredients and beat for 1 1/2 minutes, scraping the
  sides of the bowl twice. Add the egg mixture in 3 parts, scraping the
  sides of the bowl and beating for 20 seconds after each addition. Add
  the melted chocolate and beat until just incorporated. Pour the
  batter into the prepared pans and bake in the center of the preheated
  oven until the cake springs back when lightly pressed in the center,
  25 to 30 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans for 10 minutes and
  invert onto racks. Cool completely before frosting. Frost the top
  surface of one layer of cake and top with the second layer. Spread
  the remaining frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Make a
  decorative pattern zigzag in the frosting by pulling a serrated knife
  across the surface in a back-and-forth motion.  Use a small spatula
  or spoon handle to pull out spikes of frosting all around the sides.
  Cake can be completed a day ahead and refrigerated.
  
  SERVING:  Return to room temperature if refrigerated. Cut into wedges
  and serve.
  
  Makes one 9-inch cake.

    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Butter and powdered cocoa
           -for the pan
           Frosting:
      1 c  Sour cream at room
           -temperature
     14 oz Baker's semi-sweet chocolate
           -(do not substitute)
 
  Cake:
  
  Place oven rack in lower third of the oven, and preheat oven to 375
  degrees.  Butter an 8 inch springform pan, and coat with powdered
  cocoa.
  
  Melt chocolate and butter in a double boiler over hot, but *not
  boiling*, water. (don't rush this step, chocolate burns easily)
  
  Beat egg yolks in a lg mixer bowl at high speed, gradually adding 3/4
  c of the granulated sugar.  Beat until yolk mixture is pale yellow
  and thick, 4 to 6 minutes. Add melted chocolate mixture to the yolk
  mixture. Beat until completely smooth.  Add vanilla and liquor of
  your choice. Beat until blended.
  
  Beat egg whites in mdm mixer bowl at high speed until soft peaks form.
  Gradually beat remaining 1/4 c granulated sugar into whites; continue
  beating until stiff but not dry peaks form. Fold whites *gently* but
  thoroughly into chocolate mixture.  Pour batter evenly into pan;
  smooth top.
  
  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce oven to 350 degrees; bake another 15 minutes.
  Reduce oven temp to 250; bake 30 minutes longer (total baking time is
  1 hour).  Turn off oven; prop open oven door and allow cake to remain
  in oven for 30 minutes.  Remove cake from oven and cover top with
  damp paper towelling; let stand 5 minutes.
  
  Remove towelling and cool cake completely.  Dome of cake will crack
  and collapse; this is normal - press top of cake down lightly to
  smooth top. Remove springform and transfer cake to serving platter.
  
  To make the frosting:
  
  Melt chocolate in double boiler over hot but not boiling water. Using
  a wooden spoon, mix in sour cream. Pour over the cake. Let cool and

  Bring to a boil in a large heavy pan: Bring t a boil and cook covered
  2-3 minutes until the steam washes down from the sides of the pan any
  crystals which may have formed. Uncover, redice heat and cook without
  stirring to soft-ball stage, 238 degrees. When nearing 238, there is
  a fine overall bubbling with, simultaneously, a coarser patter, as
  though the fine bubbled areas were being pulled down for quilting
  into the coarser ones. Remove from heat without jostling or stirring.
  Cool the candy to 110. You may hasten this process by placing the hot
  pan in a larger pan of cold water until the bottom of the pan has
  cooled.  Add: 2 4 TBSP butter Beat fudge partially.  Add: 1 tsp
  vanilla Then beat until it begins to lose its sheen. At this point
  the drip from the spoon, when you flip it over, holds its shape
  against the bottom of the spoon. Quickly add: 1/2 1 c. broken nut
  meats Pour the fudge into a buttered pan. Cut into squares before it
  hardens. To use fudge for centers, beat until thick, knead and shape.
  
  For chocolate fudge icing, the book says to:
  
  Use in all: 1 c. milk Beat until the icing is of the right

  I think, but they will work just about anyplace you need a smooth
  spreadable chocolate. Bring cream and butter to a simmer. Stir in the
  sugar. Pour cream over the chocolate in a bowl. Let stand covered for
  5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Let cool to room temp.

      5 lg Eggs
      1 lg Egg yolk
    3/4 c  Plus 2 tablespoons sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted butter,
           -melted, cooled

MMMMM--------------------------GANACHE-------------------------------
     36 oz Bittersweet (not
           -unsweetened) or semisweet
           -chocolate, finely chopped
  2 1/2 c  Whipping cream
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
  1 1/2 ts Peppermint extract
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Chocolate curls (about 6
           -ounces)
 
  For syrup: Stir water and sugar in small saucepan over low heat until
  sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil. Remove from heat. Stir in creme
  de cacao and vanilla. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill.)
  
  For genoise: Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and flour 9-inch-diameter
  springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides; line bottom with parchment
  paper. Cover cake rack with paper towel; spray paper towel with
  nonstick spray.
  
  Sift flour, cocoa powder and baking soda into small bowl 3 times.
  Combine eggs, egg yolk, sugar and salt in large stainless steel bowl.
  {Step One} Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let
  bottom of bowl touch water). Whisk until mixture is just warm to
  touch (thermometer will register 110 B0F), about 2 minutes. Remove
  mixture from over water. {Step Two} Using electric mixer, beat until
  mixture triples in volume and falls in heavy ribbon when beaters are
  lifted, about 5 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Sift flour mixture over in
  3 additions; fold gently to incorporate each time. Drizzle butter
  over and fold in (do not overmix or batter will deflate). Transfer
  batter to prepared pan.
  
  Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40
  minutes. Cut around pan sides; release sides. Turn cake out onto
  towel-covered rack; peel off parchment. Cool. (Can be made 1 day
  ahead. Wrap; store at room temperature.)
  
  For ganache: Place chocolate in large bowl. Bring cream to boil in
  small saucepan. Pour cream over chocolate. {Step Three} Add corn
  syrup and extracts; whisk until smooth. Cool to room temperature,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Transfer 3 cups ganache to medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat
  until very thick and light colored, about 12 minutes.
  
  Using long serrated knife, cut genoise horizontally into 3 layers.
  Place 1 cake layer on cardboard round or pan bottom. Brush cake with
  3 tablespoons syrup. Spread 1/3 of whipped ganache over. Repeat 2
  more times with remaining cake layers, syrup and whipped ganache.
  Spread 1 cup unwhipped ganache thinly over top and sides of cake.
  Refrigerate cake until coating sets, about 10 minutes.
  
  If necessary, warm remaining un-whipped ganache until just pourable.
  Place cake on rack set over sheet of foil. Pour ganache over cake as
  glaze, spreading to cover top and sides smoothly. Chill until glaze
  begins to set, about 30 minutes. Place cake on platter. Press
  chocolate curls onto sides. Chill at least 2 hours.
  
  Makes 10-12 servings.

  1 hour or until frosting is completely dry. To decorate, using
  frosting in pastry bag, attach a candy cane along outside bottom edge
  on each side of each sleigh to resemble runners. Using small writing
  tip, write name on each side of sleigh. Decorate with the frosting &
  candies, as desired. To serve, fill sleighs with candies. Submitted

  Mix the cocoa, sugar, and flour together.  Add the milk, making sure
  it mixes smoothly.  Heat (medium) and stir constantly until it
  thickens. This takes about 8 minutes. Take off of heat. Add butter.
  Stir until it is melted and mixed.  Add vanilla and stir until mixed.
  
  Serve hot over buttered biscuits.  Buttered toast will do in a pinch.
  
  Notes: This is an almost lost Ozark classic. It hardly ever shows up
  in ethnic or regional cookbooks.
  
  If this cools, it becomes something else: chocolate pudding!
  
  Chocolate gravy is a great way to make sure your kids get their

      1 c  HEAVY CREAM
      1 tb LIGHT CORN SYRUP
 
  Note: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 F.
  Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast for 12 to 15
  minutes, or until golden beneath the skins. Wrap the nuts in a clean
  towel and cool completely. Transfer the cooled hazelnuts to a large
  sieve and rub them back and forth to remove the loose skins. Make the
  chocolate butter cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and
  preheat to 375 F. Line the bottom of a 17 1/2-by-11 1/2-inch jelly
  roll pan with parchment or waxed paper. Lightly spray the bottom and
  sides of the pan with nonstick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk
  together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Sift the
  flour mixture onto a piece of waxed paper and set aside. In a 4
  1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle
  attachment, beat the butter at medium-high speed for 1 minute, until
  creamy. While continuing to beat the butter, gradually add the
  granulated and brown sugars, stopping the machine and scraping down
  the side of the bowl as necessary. Beat the butter/sugar mixture at
  medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one
  at a time, and the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and alternately
  add one-third of the reserved dry ingredients and one-third of the
  coffee. In two more batches, alternately add the remaining dry
  ingredients and coffee, scraping down the bowl as necessary. Scrape
  the batter into the prepared pan and, using a metal cake spatula,
  smooth the batter evenly into the pan. Bake the cake for 25 to 28
  minutes, until the sides just begin to pull away from the pan and the
  surface springs back when lightly touched. Cool the cake in the pan
  set on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto a wire rack;
  carefully peel off the parchment paper and allow the cake to cool
  completely. Continued..........

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  Continued:
  
  Make the caramelized hazelnuts and hazelnut praline: Lightly spray a
  baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. In a small saucepan,
  combine the sugar and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring
  constantly, until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to
  medium-high and continue to cook without stirring for 4 to 6 minutes
  until the syrup caramelizes. Immediately remove the pan from the
  heat. Add the 12 perfect hazelnuts to the caramel and toss to coat.
  With an oiled fork, remove each hazelnut, letting the excess caramel
  drip back into the pan, and place them at one end of the prepared
  baking sheet. Quickly stir the 3/4 cup of hazelnuts into the
  remaining hot caramel. Pour the hazelnut praline onto the other end
  of the baking sheet. Cool the praline for 30 minutes until hard.
  Reserve the individual caramelized hazelnuts for decorating the cake.
  Coarsely chop the praline. In a food processor fitted with the metal
  chopping blade, process the praline for 35 to 45 seconds until finely
  ground. Transfer the praline to a bowl and set aside. Make the
  framboise syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the water and sugar.
  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until
  the sugar dissolves . Stop stirring; raise the heat to medium-high
  and bring the syrup to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and stir
  in the framboise liqueur and vanilla. Make the mascarpone cream
  filling: In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using
  the wire whip attachment, beat together the mascarpone cheese, sugar
  and framboise liqueur at medium speed until combined, about 1 minute.
  While continuing to beat the mixture, gradually add the heavy cream;
  increase the speed to medium-high and beat the mascarpone mixture
  until soft peaks form and the mixture is spreadable. Cover and
  refrigerate the cream until ready to use. Assemble the cake: Using a
  long serrated knife, cut the cake lengthwise into 3 long strips of
  equal width. Place one cake strip on a wire rack. Using a pastry
  brush, moisten the top of the chocolate cake strip with some of the
  framboise syrup. Using an offset metal cake spatula, spread 1/4 cup
  of the mascarpone cream over the moistened cake strip. Cover the
  cream-coated strip with a layer of raspberries, placed stem-side-down
  in even rows over the cake (this will take approximately 2 1/3 cups
  of raspberries). Scrape l 1/2 cups of the mascarpone cream on top of
  the raspberries. Using a small offset metal spatula smooth the cream
  into an even layer, allowing it to settle into the gaps in between
  the raspberries. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the ground praline over the
  cream layer. Place a second cake strip on top of the praline; repeat
  the preceding layering process and top with the final cake strip.
  Reserve the remaining ground praline to garnish the sides of the
  cake. Spread the remaining mascarpone cream in a thin even layer
  around the sides of the cake, filling in all the gaps. Place the wire
  rack with the cake on it in the refrigerator for l hour to set. Make
  the glaze: Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan,
  bring the cream and corn syrup to a gentle boil. Pour the hot cream
  mixture over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to
  melt the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Allow the glaze to
  cool for 5 minutes. Glaze the cake: Remove the cake from the
  refrigerator and place the wire rack on a baking sheet. Pour the
  glaze over the cake, covering it completely. While the glaze is still
  wet, put the remaining ground praline around the sides of the cake.
  Refrigerate the cake for 5 to 10 minutes, until the glaze is set.
  Garnish the top of the cake with the caramelized hazelnuts.

      4 c  Sliced almonds
    1/4 c  Honey
      6 oz Unsalted butter
      8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate;
           -chopped into 1/4" pcs
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Water
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate;
           -chopped into 1/4" pcs
    1/4 c  Myer's Dark rum
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast 2 cups of almonds on a baking
  sheet in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 to 14
  minutes. Remove the almonds from the oven and allow to cool to room
  temperature. Transfer the almonds to a large dish or other suitable
  container and set aside until needed. Melt the butter in a 2 1/2-qt
  saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly as it melts so it does
  not simmer or boil. As soon as the butter is completely melted, add
  the sugar, water, rum, and honey. Increase the heat to medium high.
  Heat the mixture to a temperature of 220 degrees, stirring
  constantly. Add the untoasted almonds and continue to heat and stir
  until the mixture reaches a temperature of 225 degrees. Evenly divide
  the honey-almond mixture between the 2 baking sheets. Place the
  baking sheets on the top and middle shelves of the preheated oven and
  bake until the mixture is evenly caramelized, about 24 to 26 minutes.
  Rotate the baking sheets from top to bottom about halfway through the
  baking time. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
  Combine the semi-sweet and unsweetened chocolate pieces and evenly
  divide and sprinkle over the surface of the caramelized hone-almond
  mixture. Allow to stand for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to spread the
  chocolate throughout the mixture. Evenly divide and sprinkle the
  toasted almonds over the chocolate. Place both baking sheets in the
  freezer for 20 minutes. Remove the Chocolate Honey Almond Crunch from
  the freezer and break into irregular pieces. Store in a sealed
  plastic container in the freezer or refrigerator. Yields: About 2 3/4

  is melted completely. Whisk in preserves or marmalade until combined
  well. Remove from heat and stir in liqueur. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

      Title: CHOCOLATE INTEMPERANCE
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2    Pounds, semisweet chocolate
      3    Eggs, seperated
    1/2 c  Strong coffee
    1/2 c  Tia Maria
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Cake:
     23 oz Brownie mix
      2 tb Water
      3    Eggs
           Glaze:
      8 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
    1/3 c  Water
 
  Serves: 8 to 10
  
  This mousse-filled, chocolate-swathed mold is an embarrassment of
  riches. When served to chocolate lovers, the only sound in the room
  will be faint moans of pure, unadulterated decadent pleasure.
  
  Filling:
  
  Melt chocolate with coffee on top of a double boiler. When chocolate
  is completely melted, remove pan from heat. Beat egg yolks until pale
  yellow and stir into chocolate. Gradually stir in Tia Maria. Cool
  mixture.
  
  In a seperate bowl, beat egg whites, gradually adding sugar until
  whites are stiff. Whip cream. Gently fold whipped cream into cooled
  chocolate mixture and then fold in egg whites.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Beat ingredients together at medium speed of
  electric mixer until batter is smooth. Grease an 11-by-15 inch
  jellyroll pan. Line it with waxed paper. Grease and lightly flower
  paper, shaking off any excess flower.  Spread batter evenly in
  jellyroll pan. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until cake tests done.
  Turn cake onto a rack and peel off paper. Lightly oil a 2-quart
  charlotte mold and line with cooled cake. Cut rounds of cake to fit
  both top and bottom of mold, and a strip for sides. Place smaller
  round in bottom of mold. (you will probably have to piece one section
  of side to cover completely, but don't worry; any patchwork will be
  hidden by chocolate glaze.) Fit larger round of cake on top of mold.
  Chill for 3 or 4 hours or until firm. Unmold and cover with glaze.
  
  Melt chocolate in water and stir until smooth.  Spread over top of
  mousse-cake and drizzle down sides.  Chill again. Serve in slender
  slices ~- its indecently opulent.
  
  Hints: Melt chocolate in microwave. Its much faster. Instructions are
  on the chocolate package.
  
  A souffle dish makes a good replacement for the Charlotte mold.

  melted and the mixture is smooth. Sift together the flour, cocoa,
  baking powder, salt, and pepper and set aside.  In a large bowl, beat
  the butter until creamy and add the vanilla. Gradually add the sugar
  and beat well. Add the eggs and beat until smooth.  Then, on low
  speed, alternately ass the dry ingredients and the chocolate
  mixtures. Pour the mixture into the prepared pans and bake for 1 hour
  and 10 to 15 minutes. Cover the pans loosely with foil after about 40
  minutes of baking. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes,
  then invert pan and cool the cake, upside down on a rack. (The bottom
  of the cake is very moist and tender at this stage). Refrigerate and

  "The date filling makes this special, and the frosting is unusually
  good. Because the cake has a custard filling, it needs to be kept
  refrigerated."
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Melt the chocolate in the top of a double
  boiler over barely simmering water (or in the microwave). Sift the
  flour, baking powder, and salt together. In a large mixer bowl, cream
  the butter and sugar until the mixture is fluffy.  Add the eggs, 1 at
  a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in the melted
  chocolate and vanilla. Add the dry ingredients to the chocolate
  mixture, alternating with the buttermilk and beginning and ending
  with the flour. Do not overbeat.
  
  Pour the batter into three 8 inch buttered cake layer pans. Bake for
  25 to 30 minutes, or until the cake has shrunk away a bit from the
  sides of the pans and the tops spring back when touched with your
  finger. Allow to stand in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a
  rack to cool. While the cakes are cooling, prepare the filling and
  frosting.
  
  To make the filling, heat the milk and dates in the top of a double
  boiler over hot water until the milk is scalded. Beat the egg, then
  add the sugar, flour, and salt; beat again. Add 1/2 cup of the hot
  milk mixture to the egg mixture, then stir back into the pan and cook
  for 3 minutes, until thick, stirring with a rubber spatula. Let cool.
  Add the nuts, and vanilla. Refrigerate for 1-1/2 hours before filling
  the cake.
  
  To make the frosting, combine all the ingredients in a large mixer
  bowl. Beat on high speed for 1 minute, or until the frosting is light
  and creamy.
  
  To assemble, place 1 cake layer on a large plate and cover to within
  1/4 inch of the edge with half the chilled filling. Top with another
  cake layer and the remaining filling mixture. Finish with the last
  cake layer. Frost the sides and top of the cake with the fudge
  frosting forming swirls on the top with a knife. Refrigerate, but
  bring to room temperature before serving.

      Title: CHOCOLATE MADELEINES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Grated lemon rind; OR
      2 ts Grated orange rind
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 ts Salt
    2/3 c  All-purpose flour
    1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
      8 tb Butter; melted
           -cooled slightly, plus
      4 tb Butter; softened
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Smear 1/2 teaspoon softened butter over the
  inside of each madeleine form. Be sure to completely cover with
  butter--don't leave spots. Combine the eggs, sugar and lemon or
  orange rind in a large mixing bowl, and stir them together. Set in a
  pan of simmering water and stir until the egg mixture is very warm to
  your finger. Remove from the heat and beat with a mixer at high speed
  until fluffy, pale yellow, and tripled in volume, about 3 minutes.
  Add the vanilla and salt. Dump the flour and cocoa into a sifter or
  strainer. Sift once, return to sifter or strainer and sprinkle half
  of it over the egg mixture, and fold it in. Pour in 8 tablespoons of
  butter and sprinkle on the remaining flour, and fold gently just
  until the batter is mixed. Spoon a generous tablespoon of batter into
  each prepared mold; do not spread it evenly; it will level itself in
  the oven. Bake for about 10 minutes, until the edges of the cakes are
  golden and they lift easily from the molds. (If you have only 1 pan,
  and can bake only 12 at a time, let the mold cool, wipe it out,
  grease with butter, then refill with batter and bake again.) Remove
  from the oven, slipping the tines of a table fork under each cookie
  to free it, and transfer the madeleines to a rack to cool. Serve
  within a few hours, or wrap airtight and freeze. Serve plain, or
  sprinkle the ribbed side with confectioners' sugar.

      Title: CHOCOLATE MALTED COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 1/2 dozen
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Butter Flavored Crisco
  1 1/4 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
    1/2 c  Malted milk powder
      2 tb Chocolate syrup
      1 tb Vanilla extract (yes 1 tb)
      1 lg Egg
  1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
      1 c  Milk chocolate chips
 
  Preheat oven to 350-degrees. Get out 2 cookie sheets; no need to
  grease them. Mix together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.
  
  In a mixing bowl, combine the shortening, brown sugar, malted milk
  powder, chocolate syrup and vanilla. Beat 2 minutes, then add the egg
  and beat for a second or two, until mixed.
  
  Gradually add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture, mixing well
  between additions. Stir in chocolate morsels and chips. I j used
  Guittard's BIG chocolate morsels and their milk chocolate chips. BTW,
  these cookies are LOADED with chocolate chips!
  
  Shape dough into 2-inch balls. Place 6 balls of dough onto each cookie
  sheet, spacing them 3 inches apart. The cookies are pretty big, not
  tiny ones.
  
  Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until golden brown. Mine took 12 minutes.
  Don't over-cook them or they'll be hard as a rock.
  
  Cool on cookie sheets for at least 2 minutes or they'll fall apart.
  Cool on wire racks.

  cookie, leaving 1/4" border. Top with another cookie; press gently to
  spread the ice cream to the edge. Wrap well in plastic wrap and
  freeze until firm, about 2 hours. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1

 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        2 TB unsweetened cocoa powder
        3 TB boiling water
        1 ts almond extract
       14 lg egg whites, -- about 1 3/4
  :          cups
        1 ts cream of tartar
    1 3/4 c  sugar
      1/2 ts salt
        2 ts vanilla
    1 1/4 c  flour, -- sifted
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, combine the cocoa,
  water, and almond extract until blended. Set aside to cool. Beat the
  egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Gently
  beat in the sugar, salt, and vanilla until the peaks retain their
  shape when the whisk is removed. Gradually fold in the flour until
  well blended. Remove 2 cups of batter and combine it with the cocoa
  mixture. Pour half of the light batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube
  pan with removable bottom. Pour the chocolate batter over the light.
  Finally, top with the remaining light batter. Gently swirl mixture
  with a knife to help remove any air bubbles and to create a marble
  pattern. Bake in the middle of the oven for 40 to 45 minutes until
  the cake is springy and begins to pull away from the sides of the
  pan. The cake will rise, crack on the top, and then fall slightly.
  This is normal. Remove from the oven and invert the pan over the neck
  of a bottle until the cake is completely cool, about 1 hour. Gently
  loosen the sides and remove the cake from pan. Place it on a serving
  plate. This cake can be served alone or with a chocolate sauce. A
  serrated knife makes cutting the cake much easier.

      Title: CHOCOLATE MERINGUE PIE
 Categories: Pies, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Pie shell, 9"; baked
    1/2 c  Cocoa, Dutch process
           -unsweetened
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      3    Egg; separated
      2 c  Milk
      2 ts Vanilla (not extract)
      2 tb Butter

MMMMM--------------------------MERINGUE-------------------------------
      3    Egg white
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla (not extract)
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
      1 ts Baking powder
    2/3 c  Sugar
 
  Pie:  Combine dry ingredients in a medium saucepan and stir to mix
  thor- oughly before you add liquids.  Now add egg yolks (save the
  whites for the meringue) and milk and whisk until there are
  absolutely no lumps. Place directly over medium-low heat, stir
  CONSTANTLY until the pudding thickens and comes to a plopping boil.
  Watch it like a hawk and DON'T TURN UP THE FIRE; at this stage it'll
  stick and burn at the least provocation! Patience is essential here.
  Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and butter. Pour into baked
  pie shell. Top with meringue. Bake at 325 F. until the meringue
  browns, 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Meringue:  Beat egg whites and all other ingredients except sugar
  until foamy.  Add sugar, ONE TABLESPOON AT A TIME, while beating
  vigorously until the whites will hold a firm peak and are satiny
  looking. Spread meringue over the hot filling, starting with small
  amounts at the edges and sealing to the crust all around. If you
  don't make sure the meringue is well stuck to the crust at this
  stage, it'll shrink and pull away during the baking, which makes a
  lots less attractive pie. Spread pie with remaining meringue, making
  hills and valleys.
  
  Adding the sugar a little at a time helps make sure that it dissolves
  completely, and so helps prevent the meringue from weeping. Also,
  spreading the meringue over the hot filling helps--I don't know why.

  cream into chocolate mixture. Cover and chill. For Chocolate Bark:
  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment.  Finely grind mints in
  food processor. Place half of chocolate in top of double boiler set
  over simmering water. Stir until candy thermometer registers 115
  degrees. Pour onto 1 prepared sheet. Using spatual, spread chcolate
  to 1/16-inch thickness over parchment. Spinkle half of ground candies
  over half of chocolate. Fold parchment in half to seal candies in
  chocolate. Repeat with remaining chocolate and candies. Cover and
  chill 1 to 24 hours. Peel parchment off chocolate bark. Break or cut
  each sheet of bark into 6 irregular pieces, reserving any small
  pieces for garnish.  Place 1 bark piece on plate. Spread scant 1/3
  cup mousse over bark.  Place another bark piece atop mousse.  Spread
  scant 1/3 cup mousse over.  Top with another bark piece.
  
  Place dollop of mousse atop chocolate and top with any smaller bark
  pieces, standing pieces upright.  Repeat with remaining bark and
  mousse. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover; chill. ) Garnish with
  fresh mint leaves. Serve napoleons with mint sauce. My note: The
  picture of this recipe shows the napoleons sitting atop the mint
  sauce which has been carefully spooned in swirls on to the plate.

  scraping bowl frequently with rubber spatula.  Wrap dough with
  plastic wrap and refrigerate until easy to handle, about two hours
  (or place dough in freezer 40 minutes).
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Measure 1/3 cup sugar into a small bowl. With
  hands, shape dough into 96 balls; roll balls in sugar to coat. On
  ungreased cookie sheets, place balls, about two inches apart.
  
  Bake cookies 12 to 15 minutes until set.  Immediately remove half of
  cookies from cookie sheets and invert onto work surface. While they
  are still hot, place chocolate-covered mint patties on the cookies on
  your work surface.  Then quickly top with remaining cookies, top-side
  up, pressing cookies together slightly so the mint patty spreads out
  to the cookie edges as it melts.  With a pancake turner, remove the
  cookies to wire racks to cool.  Store cookies in a tightly covered
  container to use up within 1 week.

  In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining dry ingredients and mix
  on low speed for 30 seconds to blend. Add half the chocolate mixture
  and the butter to the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until the dry
  ingredients are moistened.  On medium speed (high speed if using a
  hand-held mixer), beat for 1 minute to aerate and develop the
  structure. Scrape the sides of the bowl.  Gradually add the remaining
  chocolate mixture in 2 batches, beating for 20 seconds after each
  addition to incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the structure.
  Scrape the sides of the bowl. Scrape the batter into a gallon
  capacity freezer bag, close it securely, and cut off a small piece
  from one of the corners of the bag. Pipe the batter into buttered
  madeleine molds, filling them not quite full. Leave the remaining
  batter in the bag, refrigerated, for the following batches.
  
  Bake for 10-12 minutes or until a tester inserted in the center comes
  out clean and the madeleines spring back when pressed lightly in the
  centers. For even baking, rotate the molds from top to bottom and
  front to back halfway through the baking time.
  
  Unmold madeleines onto wire racks to cool completely.
  
  If desired, these madeleines may be brushed with a Kahlua syrup made
  as follows:
  
  In a small pan, stir together the sugar and water. Bring to a full
  rolling boil.  Cover immediately and remove the pan from the heat.
  When cool, swirl in the Kahlua.
  
  If desired, brush the madeleines on both sides with the syrup. Wrap
  each one separately in plastic wrap. For the most attractive
  appearance, store them without the syrup and brush on the syrup a day
  or so before you plan to serve them.
  
  Store in an airtight container at room temperature, or in the
  refrigerator or freezer.
  
  Keeps 3 days without syrup, 1 week with syrup, at room temperature; 2
  weeks refrigerated; 3 months frozen.
  
  Tips: If you do not have enough madeleine molds to bake all the
  batter at one time, store the batter in the refrigerator and bake it
  in batches. Rinse out the molds after each batch and butter them.
  
  If you are planning to use the madeleines to dunk, omit the syrup;
  madeleines should be a little dry so that they act like sponges. The
  syrup helps to preserve the moistness and will greatly extend their
  keeping qualities, which is helpful if you are planning to give them
  as gifts.
  
  The syrup allows the cookies to keep over 1 week at room temperature.
  If you are planning the eat them the same day or the next, omit the
  syrup or use only a sprinkle of Kahlua. The subtle coffee flavor
  accentuates the chocolate.

      Title: CHOCOLATE MORSELS
 Categories: Chocolate, Cookies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
      6 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1    Egg yolk
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa
      1 c  Semi-sweet chocolate
 
  Preparation time: 10 min. Baking time: 15 to 20 min. Oven
  temperature: 350 degrees F.
  
  A rich chocolate chip morsel, somewhere between a cookie and a candy.
  Easy to bake up a batch and keep on hand.
  
  For 3 dozen cookies you will need:
  
  chips
  
  1. Cream the butter until light.
  
  2. Beat in the brown sugar. Mix until creamy. Add the vanilla and egg
  yolk.
  
  3. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and cocoa powder. Add to
  the butter mixture.
  
  4. Stir in the chocolate chips.
  
  5. Shape by teaspoon-ful into 1-inch balls. Place on lightly greased
  cookie sheets.
  
  6. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove to rack to
  cool.
  
  Tips: When "creaming" butter and sugar, the particles of each won't
  show up separately. When recipes indicate "blanding", the mixing is
  done to a lesser extent.

      Title: CHOCOLATE MOSAIC FRUIT TART
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------CHOCOLATE TART CRUST-------------------------
      4 oz Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet
           -Chocolate
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar
    1/2 c  Slivered almonds
    1/2 c  Unsifted flour
    1/2 c  Cold butter, cut up
    1/8 ts Salt
      1    Egg
      1 ts Vanilla

MMMMM-------------------CHOCOLATE TART FILLING------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      1    Egg
      4 oz Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet
           -Chocolate
      3 tb Heavy whipping cream
      1 ts Vanilla or Grand Marnier
           Fresh fruit: strawberries,
           -kiwi, bananas,
           Green grapes, oranges, etc.
    1/4 c  Apricot jam
 
  Servings: 8
  
  DIRECTIONS: For crust: Place broken chocolate pieces, sugar and
  almonds into bowl of processor or blender. Process for about 20 to 25
  seconds until the mixture is like powder. On top of chocolate mixture
  in food processor, spread flour, butter and salt. Process 15 to 20
  pulses or until butter is in very fine pieces. (Or butter may be cut
  into flour by hand using a pastry cutter, then combined with
  chocolate.) Add egg and vanilla. Pulse about 15 times or stir lightly
  until mixture sticks together when pinched with fingers. On plastic
  wrap, knead a few times to bring dough together to form a ball;
  flatten to 8". It is easier to use your fingers to pat the dough into
  tart pan than to roll dough. Use a 10 1/2" flat tart pan with 1"
  fluted sides. Bake in center of oven at 350-F for 15 to 18 minutes or
  until baked shell springs back when touched. (Do not overbake.) Cool.
  Remove outside ring of pan. Crust may be prepared a day in advance,
  if desired. (MY NOTES: this crust seemed too wet before baking, but
  turned out fine after about 16 or 17 minutes baking time. It was like
  a brownie crust.)
  
  Chocolate tart filling: In small mixer bowl, beat butter with sugar
  and egg; beat until fluffy. Melt broken chocolate in double boiler,
  stirring constantly, or microwave on medium for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.
  Add warm chocolate to creamed mixture and beat well. Mix in cream and
  vanilla, beating until thick and creamy. Spread filling over baked
  Chocolate Tart Crust. While filling is still soft, artistically
  arrange fruit on top. For fruit glaze, strain apricot jam. With
  pastry brush, use glaze to cover pieces of fruit and top edge of
  crust. Chill about 2 hours. Decorate with chocolate curls, if
  desired. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature before serving.

      1 c  Hazelnuts -- toasted and
           Skinned
      2 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Egg whites

           Melted
           Mousse-----
      7 oz Bittersweet chocolate --
           Chopped
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate --
           Chopped
      3 tb Framboise
    1/3 c  Coffee -- strong brewed
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      4 lg Egg whites
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
           Whipped Cream-----
      5 ts Gelatin -- unflavored
    1/4 c  Framboise
      4 c  Heavy cream -- well-chilled
    1/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
  2 1/2 c  Raspberries -- picked over
           Garnish-----
      3 oz Unsweetened chocolate --
           Melted
      1 c  Raspberries
 
  Line three buttered baking sheets with parchment or foil and trace an
  11" circle on each sheet of parchment. Meringues: In a food processor
  grind fine the hazelnuts with 1/2 cup of the sugar, transfer the
  mixture to a bowl, and stir in 1/2 cup of the remaining sugar and the
  salt, stirring and fluffing the mixture until it is combined well. In
  a large bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites with a pinch
  of salt until they hold soft peaks, add the remain- ing one cup sugar
  gradually, beating, and beat the egg whites until they hold stiff
  glossy peaks. Fold in the hazelnut mixture gently but thor- oughly
  and transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2" plain
  tip. Starting in the middle of each parchment circle pipe the mixture
  in a tight spiral to fill the circles and bake the meringues on three
  evenly spaced racks or in batches in a preheated 250 F. oven,
  switching the meringues from one rack to another every 20 minutes,
  for one hour or until they are firm when touched. Remove the
  parchment from the baking sheets, let the meringues cool on it, and
  peel off the parchment carefully.  (The meri ngues may be made one
  day in advance and kept wrapped well in plastic wrap at room
  temperature. ) Trim the meringues to auniform size if necessary with
  a serrated knife and reserve the best-looking meringue for the top
  layer. Spread the underside of one of the remaining meringues with
  the melted chocolate (this will be the middle layer), reserve it,
  chocolate side up, and put the remaining meringue (this will be the
  bottom layer) on a large flat cake platter. See ChocolateMousse &
  Raspberry Cream Dacquoise 2 for rest of directions (too large for one

  See Chocolate Mousse & Raspberry Cream Dacquoise 1 for first half of
  directions.
  
  Mousse:  In a bowl set over barely simmering water melt the
  chocolates with the framboise and the coffee, whisking until the
  mixture is smooth, and let the mixture cool. In a small heavy
  saucepan combine the sugar with 1/2 cup water and bring the mixture
  to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Boil the syrup,
  undisturbed, until it registers 248 F. on a candy thermometer and
  remove the pan from the heat. While the syrup is boiling, in the
  large bowl of an electric mixer beat the egg whites with a pinch of
  salt until they are foamy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the egg
  whites until they hold soft peaks. With the mixer running add the hot
  syrup in a stream and beat the mixture on medium speed for 20
  minutes, or until it is cool. Whisk about one cup of the egg white
  mixture into the chocolate mixture to lighten it and fold the
  chocolate mixture into the remaining eggwhite mixture gently but
  thoroughly. Mound the mousse in the middle of the bottom meringue
  layer, top it with the chocolate-covered meringue layer, chocolate
  side up, and press the layer down gently until the mousse almost
  reaches the edge. Chill the cake for one hour, or until the mousse is
  set. Whipped cream: In a very small saucepan sprinkle the gelatin
  over the framboise and two tablespoons water, let it soften for five
  minutes, and heat the mixture over low heat, stirring, until the
  gelatin is dis- solved. Let the gelatin cool as much as possible
  while still remaining liquid.  In a chilled large bowl beat the cream
  with the sugar and the vanilla until it is thick and the beaters just
  begin to leave a mark, Add the gelatin mixture in a stream, beating,
  and beat the mixture until it just holds stiff peaks.  (Be careful
  not to over-beat. ) Reserve one-fourth of the whipped cream and
  spread half the remaining whipped cream on top of the
  chocolate-covered meringue layer. Arrange the raspberries on top and
  spread the remaining half of the whipped cream on top. Put the
  reserved meringue on the whipped cream, pressing it down gently, and
  spread some of the reserved whipped cream on the side of the cake.
  Put the remaining reserved whipped cream in a pastry bag fitted with
  a star tip and pipe it decoratively on the top and bottom edges of
  the cake. Garnish: Put the melted chocolate in a small pastry bag
  fitted with a plain writing tip and pipe it in a spoke pattern on the
  top of the cake. Arrange the raspberries around the edge of the cake
  and in the center. Chill the cake for at least four hours and up to
  eight hours.

   FOR THE CAKES: Butter two 9" round cake pans and line the bottoms
  with wax paper, then butter the paper. Dust the pans with flour and
  knock out the excess. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
   In the top of a double boiler, heat the chocolate over hot water,
  stirring, until just melted. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in
  the butter, one tablespoon at a time. Continue to stir the mixture
  until smooth. In the bowl of the mixer, beat the egg yolks until
  combined. Add 34 cup of the sugar, a little at a time, and continue
  to beat the mixture until it falls in a ribbon when the beater is
  lifted.
   Beat in the melted chocolate mixture, the liqueur and the orange
  pinch of salt until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and beat the
  whites until they hold soft peaks. Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, a
  little at a time, and beat the whites until they are stiff. Sift the
  flour with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt onto a sheet of wax paper.
  Stir one fourth of the whites into the batter. Fold in the remaining
  whites and sift and fold the flour mixture in batches into the egg
  mixture until just combined.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------GANACHE ICING AND ASSEMBLY----------------------

MMMMM-----------------FOR CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE----------------------
      1 c  Heavy cream
      8 oz Semisweet chocolate
           - Chopped coarse
      2 tb Orange flavored liqueur

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Oranges; halved/sliced thin
           - into half rounds/about 14
           - slices
 
  FOR THE GANACHE: In a small saucepan bring the cream just to a simmer.
  Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolate and let the mixture
  stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Stir in the liqueur and continue to
  stir the ganache until smooth and tepid. Strain through a fine sieve
  into a small pitcher or a bowl with a lip.
  
  ASSEMBLY: Cut an 8" cardboard round and put one teaspoon of the
  mousse in the center of it, then set one of the cake layers, bottom
  side up on the cardboard. Cover the cake with some of the mousse,
  smoothing it into an even layer, and top it with the remaining layer,
  bottom side up. Cover the top and the sides of the cake with the
  remaining mousse, smoothing it with a spatula, and chill the cake
  until it is cold. Set the cake on a rack over a jelly roll pan and
  pour the creme ganache over it, smoothing it with a spatula to
  completely cover the top and sides of the cake. Let the cake stand at
  room temperature for 10 minutes and scrape any excess chocolate glaze
  from the jelly roll pan back into the saucepan. Heat the excess
  ganache, stirring, until smooth, cool it to tepid, and pour it over
  the cake, smoothing it with a spatula over the top and sides of the
  cake. Chill the cake until the glaze is set. Transfer the reserved
  chocolate mixture to a pastry bag. Arrange orange slices, rounded
  sides up on the top of the cake, so that one end of the slice is
  toward the center and the other is toward the edge of the cake. Pipe
  the chocolate mixture along the base on each side of the orange
  slices. Arrange the remaining cream decoratively around the bottom
  edge of the cake. Let the cake stand at room temperature for at least
  15 minutes before serving.

      Title: CHOCOLATE MOUSSE DESSERT
 Categories: Chocolate, Mousses
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Chocolate Mousse-----
      6 oz Semisweet Chocolate Chips --
           Or chunks
      5 tb Boiling Water
      4    Eggs -- separated
      2 tb Dark Rum -- (or coffee or
           Liquer
           Graham Cracker Crust-----
     15    Graham Crackers
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 c  Butter -- melted
 
  Put the chocolate in a blender on high for 6 seconds (or so). Scrape
  the sides of the blender with a knife. Add the water and blend on
  high for 10 seconds.  Then add the yolks and liquer/coffee and blend
  until smooth.
  
  Meanwhile, beat the egg ehites to stiffness.
  
  Fold the chocolate into the egg whites.  Pour mousse into cups or
  into the graham crakcer crust.  It makes about 4-6 servings.
  
  Break the crackers into a blender and blend into crumbs. Place the
  crumbs into a bowl.  Stir in the sugar, cinnamon and add the butter
  and mix. Press into a pie plate and chill before adding filling.
  
  I cheated and bought a Keebler shell. I brushed it with egg white and
  baked it at 350 for 5 minutes.  I guess you could do that with this
  crust, never tried.
  
  Your standard toll-house chocolate works fine for the mousse but the
  Ghirardelli chocolate made my knees weak! I also used anisette
  instead of rum.
  
  You should have seen my kitchen!  Flour and chocolate EVERYWHERE! At
  least I got to lick the bowl

     13    Maraschino cherries w/ stems
           - drained
    1/2 c  Brandy
      5 oz Semisweet chocolate

MMMMM----------------------CHOCOLATE CRUST---------------------------
    2/3 pk Dark choc. wafers (8 1/2-oz)
      2 tb Butter; melted

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      8    Eggs; separated
           Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Brandy
     10 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      2 oz Semisweet chocolate
    3/4 c  Butter; softened
    1/2 c  Coffee
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
 
  Soak cherries in 1/2 cup brandy and place in freezer. Melt 5 ounces
  semisweet chocolate over hot water. When cherries are frozen, dry on
  paper towel and quickly dip, one at a time, into chocolate, swirling
  around by stem until completely covered. Chocolate will harden almost
  immediately. Place on waxed-paper- lined rack in refrigerator until
  ready to use.
  
  To make crust, grind wafers in blender until crumbs are very fine.
  Combine melted butter with crumbs and pat onto sides and bottom of
  buttered 9-inch springform pan. Bake at 325F 10 minutes. Remove from
  oven and cool completely.
  
  Meanwhile, to make filling, combine egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups sugar,
  vanilla, salt and 1/2 cup brandy in top of double boiler. Place over
  simmering water and beat until pale yellow and thick, about 8 to 10
  minutes. Remove from water and set aside. Melt unsweetened and 2
  ounces semisweet chocolate in top of double boiler over hot water.
  When melted, remove from water and beat in softened butter, a bit at
  a time. Gradually beat chocolate into egg yolk mixture until smooth.
  Chocolate mixture will congeal and become very stiff. Beat in coffee.
  Beat egg whites (at room temperature) into soft peaks. Gradually beat
  in 3 tablespoons sugar until stiff peaks form. Beat 1 cup of beaten
  egg whites into chocolate mixture to thin, then carefully fold in
  remaining beaten egg whites until thoroughly incorporated. Whip cream
  until stiff and gently fold into chocolate mixture. Pour into
  prepared crust and chill overnight in refrigerator. Garnish with
  cherry cordials.

  1 1/4 c  Chocolate Wafer Crumbs
    1/2 c  Melted Butter -- or
           Margarine
           Mousse-----

           Finely ground
      4 oz Heavy Whipping Cream
      6 tb Unsalted Butter
      2    Eggs -- separated
           Bailey's Irish Cream --
           Optional
 
  CRUST:
  
  Add butter to crumbs just until it will hold its shape when pressed
  into a pan. I'm sorry but I've never bothered to measure the butter!
  
  MOUSSE:
  
  Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks forms.  Set aside. Heat the
  cream and butter in a heavy saucepan or double boiler over medium
  heat. When the butter is well-incorporated into the cream, add the
  chocolates. Stir off the heat until melted and well-blended. Add the
  egg yolks.
  
  Quickly fold 1/4 of the chocolate mixture into the beaten whites,
  then fold the whites into the chocolate.
  
  Fill the crust with the filling and refrigerate several hours. If you
  like you may add Bailey's Irish Cream to the filling to flavour and
  whip cream with a tiny bit of sugar and some Frangelico liqueur.
  Amaretto for the whipping cream is also nice. It's just a decadent
  final touch to an alread-decadent dessert.

      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
      6    Egg yolks
 
  Melt chocolate in top of double boiler, SLOWLY, over hot, not boiling
  water.
  
  Combine water, sugar and vanilla and cook syrup until it reaches 230
  degrees on a candy thermometer.  Set syrup aside and let it cool to a
  warm temperature around 125 degrees.
  
  Meanwhile, whip the cream until it is stiff and refrigerate it. (
  kitchen aid, use whip start on 8 ... increase to 10)
  
  Place egg yolks in mixer bowl and beat them for 1 minute. Slowly (
  just a fine line of syrup) start adding warm syrup beating all the
  while until yolks are thick and cool...approx 5 minutes. (kitchen
  aid, use paddle, speed 3)
  
  Slowly beat in the chocolate until it is blended in the yolk mixture.
  Slowly beat in the cream until it is thoroughly mixed. (kitchen aid,
  use paddle...speed2)
  
  Pour mixture into 8 long stem glasses or pretty desert dishes. Chill
  until firm.  Serves 8
  
  Notes.... This mousse is simple, yet a little tricky. The thing to
  remember is that the  syrup needs to be warm when beating into the
  egg yolks. Then beat the yolks until they are cooled.
  
  * If you are useing this at holiday time, it is wonderful served in

      7 oz Bittersweet chocolate
      1 c  Creme Fraiche
      3    Extra-large eggs; separated
           Six ramekins or long-stemmed
           -wine goblets.
 
  Several hours (up to 24) ahead, combine the raisins and the rum in a
  small bowl, cover tightly with plastic and set aside to soak. Break
  the chocolate into pieces and process in a processor until ground
  very fine. Heat the creme Fraiche to the boiling point, and with the
  motor running, pour it through the feed tube in a steady stream.
  Process a few seconds until smooth. Separate the eggs. Add the egg
  yolks to the hot chocolate mixture, and process for a few seconds to
  incorporate. Transfer to a large bowl, stir  in the drained raisins,
  and cool completely. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites
  until stiff but not dry. Scoop about one quarter of the beaten whites
  onto the chocolate mixture, and using a large rubber spatula, stir
  them into the mixture. Gently and quickly fold in the remaining
  whites. Pour the mousse into the serving dishes, cover tightly with
  plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and as long as 12
  hours. Adding the yolks to the hot chocolate mixture cooks them
  slightly and gives a creamier texture to the mousse, which is best
  served the day it is prepared. Decorate with chocolate curls or extra
  rum-soaked raisins. From: Jody Prival Busted and entered for you by:

      Title: CHOCOLATE NUT CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, No-bake
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
    1/4 lb Butter (or margarine)
      1 c  Icing sugar
      2 lg Eggs
    3/4 c  Cashews or almonds
  2 1/2 ts Cocoa
    1/2 lb Graham crackers
           Milk
    3/4 ts Vanilla
 
  Cream together the butter and sugar.  Chop the nuts and roast if
  desired.
  
  Soak the crackers in the milk until they are soft but have not turned
  to mush. Dissolve cocoa in about 2 T milk, and add this and the nuts
  to the creamed butter/sugar mixture.
  
  Separate the eggs and set the whites aside.  To the creamed mixture
  add the yolks and  vanilla and beat. Whip the whites until stiff
  peaks form, then fold this into the mixture.
  
  Line a 9-inch square pan with a layer of crackers, mixture, and
  crackers. Top with the remaining mixture and set in the refrigerator
  until hard.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A no-bake graham-cracker chocolate cake -- This is a delicious,
  easy-to-make cake that everyone enjoys. It came from an East Indian
  friend of mine who said it had been in the family. It seems western
  so I am uncertain of its origins.
  
  *  Depending on how you want the texture of the cake you can soak the
  crackers until they are slightly softened or until they fall apart.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      1 tb Unsalted butter; (cold)
      6 oz Bittersweet chocolate
           -- roughly chopped

MMMMM------------------------ORANGE GLAZE-----------------------------
      1 c  Confectioners' sugar
      3 tb Orange juice
 
  Scald the milk and let it cool to 110 degrees F.  Add 1/4 cup of the
  sugar and the yeast and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.
  Combine the orange zest with the remaining sugar in a food processor
  and process until zest is finely ground. In a heavy-duty electric
  mixer, combine the yeast mixture, zest and sugar mixture, eggs and
  egg yolks. Beat until combined, about 30 seconds. In a separate bowl,
  sift together the flour and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients
  to the liquid in the mixer bowl, beating constantly until the dough
  is sticky and soft. Add 2 sticks (1 cup) of butter, 1 tablespoon at a
  time, beating constantly until combined. Beat an additional 30
  seconds. Coat a large bowl with remaining tablespoon butter. Turn the
  dough out onto a lightly floured board; form a ball WITHOUT KNEADING
  and place in the bowl, turning to coat the dough with butter. Cover
  with plastic wrap and a towel and set aside to rise in a warm place
  until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Turn the dough out
  onto a lightly floured board.  Punch down to remove air bubbles and
  return to the bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate a
  minimum of 6 hours, or overnight. Turn the dough out onto a lightly
  floured board and gently knead in the chocolate pieces. Divide the
  dough into 16 equal parts. Roll each between your hands to form a
  1-1/2" round cylinder. To make the traditional brioche topknot, lay
  the cylinders on a counter and roll the side of your hand back and
  forth at a point about an inch from the top, so you form a shape like
  a bowling pin.  Place the dough in buttered brioche tins or muffin
  cups, pinched side up, and gently press the tops down toward the
  bottom of the tim. Place the tins on a baking sheet, cover with
  plastic wrap and a towel and set aside in a warm place to rise until
  doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake for
  20 minutes. While the brioches are baking, make the glaze. ORANGE
  GLAZE: Whisk the ingredients together to form a paste and spoon about
  1 tablespoon over each warm brioche.

  springform pan.
  
  Bake 10 minutes.
  
  Increase oven temperature to 350 F.
  
  Beat cream cheese and sugar at medium speed with electric mixer until
  well blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
  addition. Blend in sour cream and vanilla.
  
  Separate batter into 2 equal parts. Blend chocolate into one part.
  Blend liqueur and peel into remaining part. Pour chocolate batter
  over crust. Bake 30 minutes.
  
  Reduce oven temperatue to 325 F.
  
  Spoon remaining batter over chocolate layer. Continue baking another
  30 minutes. Turn off oven and prop open oven door; remove cheesecake
  when oven has cooled. Loosen cake from rim of pan.
  
  I think cheesecake in general is best when chilled over night, but it
  is not necessary.

      Title: CHOCOLATE ORGASMS
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      8 tb Unsalted butter, room temp
  1 1/4 c  Plus 1 Tbsp. sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      3 lg Eggs, room temp
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Plus 2 Tbsp chopped walnuts
           Frosting
  1 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
    1/4 c  Evaporated milk
    1/3 c  Sugar
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly grease an 8-inch square pan
  with butter or vegetable oil.  Melt the chocolate and butter in the
  top of a double boiler placed over simmering water. Cool the mixture
  for 5 minutes.
  
  Place the sugar in a medium-size mixing bowl and pour in the chocolate
  mixture.  Using an electric mixer on medium speed, mix until blended,
  about 25 seconds. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the
  vanilla. With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the eggs one at a
  time, blending after each addition until the yolk is broken and
  dispersed, about 10 seconds. Scrape the bowl after the last egg and
  blend until velvety, about 15 more seconds.
  
  Add the flour on low speed and mix for 20 seconds; finish the mixing
  by hand, being certain to mix in any flour at the bottom of the bowl.
  Stir in 1/2 cup of the nuts. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared
  pan and sprinkle the remaining 2 Tbsp of nuts over the top. Bake the
  brownies on the center oven rack until a thin crust forms on top and
  a tester inserted in the center comes out with a moist crumb, about
  35 minutes. (The center of the brownies should never quite rise to
  the height of the edges.)
  
  Remove pan from oven and place on a rack to cool for 1 hour.
  
  FROSTING: To prepare the frosting, melt the chocolate in the top of a
  double boiler placed over simmering water. Pour the evaporated milk
  into an electric blender and add the sugar and the melted chocolate.
  Blend the frosting on medium-low speed until it thickens, about 50
  seconds (the sound of the machine will change when this process
  occurs.)
  
  Using a frosting spatula, spread the frosting evenly over the surface
  of the cooled brownies and allow them to sit for 1 hour before
  cutting. Makes 36 small brownies.

      Title: CHOCOLATE OVALTINE OVALS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 80 Servings
 
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      2 c  Ovaltine
      2 ts Cocoa
    1/4 ts Salt
      8 tb (1 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  "These delicate dark wafers are light, but rich in chocolate taste.
  Not too sweet, they are the perfect complement for a dish of French
  vanilla ice cream. 325~F. 14 to 18 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  Combine the flour, Ovaltine, cocoa, and salt in a large bowl or in
  the food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal.
  
  Blend in the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. With a cookie
  cutter or the rim of a glass, cut into 2-inch circles. To make oval
  shapes, roll over each cracker gently along one axis with your
  rolling pin.
  
  Place the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
  sheet. Prick each one all the way through with the tines of a fork in
  2 or 3 places. Bake for 14 to 18 minutes. Cool on a rack. Yield:
  75-80.
  
  VARIATIONS: If you are a chocolate lover, double the amount of cocoa.
  For fancy occasions, dust the tops of these ovals with powdered
  (confectioner's) sugar before serving.

      Title: CHOCOLATE PANCAKES
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    3/4 c  Margarine
    3/4 c  Cocoa
      2 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Butter cream
           -frosting
 
  Melt the margarine and mix with the cocoa.
  
  In a small bowl, mix flour and salt.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs.  Then add sugar, vanilla, and beat
  well. Add flour and margarine mixture to this and blend thoroughly.
  
  Heat skillet to medium-low.  Drop small clumps (about 1 T) and cook
  like pancakes:  about 1 1/2 minutes on one side, 1/2 minute on the
  other, then turn over again and remove after a few seconds. Freeze.
  When relatively hard, coat one side with buttercream frosting.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Brownies in a skillet -- This recipe is based on a "chocolate
  turtle" recipe by Mae Rabenius from a cookbook produced by Faith
  United Methodist Church in Phoenix, Arizona. Yield: 40 pieces.
  
  *  One side of the pancakes may burn.  It doesn't particularly affect
  the taste, and if you frost this side, no one will even know.
  
  *  It's not necessary to cook the pancakes completely; if the middle
  looks somewhat gooey, don't fret:  it will soon harden.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes to cook, 10 minutes to
  frost. : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  the flour is moistened. Add a little more water as needed. You're
  gonna have to finish mixing by hand. Pat the dough into a ball. Clean
  off your work surface, and flour it. Knead the dough for about 10
  minutes, or until the dough becomes silky and elastic. Cover the
  dough and let it rest for half an hour so the gluten can activate in
  the flour.  Roll out 1/4 of the dough at a time, the same way you
  would any pasta. A machine makes this really easy. I prefer to let
  the pasta dry (at least a little!) before cooking. This will make 4
  to 5 cups of cooked pasta---plenty for dessert. Serve in wine glasses
  with a warm raspberry sauce and chilled whipped cream. Combine yolks
  and sugar over a double-boiler.  Whisk constantly for about 10
  minutes, until the mixture begins to thicken.  Before it turns to a
  thick custard, pour in the room-temperature champagne all at once. As
  it foams up, whisk lightly, and continue to stir as it thickens.
  Remove from heat. Serve warm over chilled berries, or over
  Cinnamon-nutmeg pasta & top with berries. Variation: Use 2 cups
  flour, omit the cocoa. Instead, add 1 tsp each cinnamon and
  freshly-ground nutmeg.  I served this one with a Champagne Cream
  sauce and fresh raspberries and blueberries.

  Recipe by: Rebecca Oeswein <oeswein@dadd.ti.com> Preheat oven to 300
  F.
  
  In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar until light and
  fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.  Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla,
  beat until smooth.  Add heavy cream, beat till well blended.
  
  Transfer 1/3 of batter to another bowl and set aside. Beat melted
  chocolate into remaining batter.  Pour into crust. With mixer on
  medium speed, beat peanut butter into remaining 1/3 batter until
  thoroughly mixed. Carefully spoon peanut butter mixture on top of
  chocolate cheese mixture in pan. Using the long handle of a wooden
  spoon, swirl the two flavors together.
  
  Bake about 1 hour, or until cheesecake is set around edges and puffed
  but still jiggles slightly in the center. Let cake cool 2 hours, then
  refrigerate until well chilled, 8 hrs. or overnight.
  
  For a crust, I use Oreo cookie crumbs and make a crust using their
  recipe. I also do not swirl the flavors together. I like them layered
  better.

      Title: CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER SCONES
 Categories: Chocolate, Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Sugar, brown
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Butter, sweet; chilled
    3/4 c  Peanut butter, creamy
    1/4 c  Milk
      2    Egg
      2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Peanuts, unsalted; chopped
  1 1/2 oz Chocolate, bittersweet
 
  Approx. Cook Time: 0:17
     Break chocolate into 8 equal pieces. Preheat oven to 375F. In a
  large bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and
  salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and distribute them over the
  flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives used scissors
  fashion, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
  In a small bowl, stir together the peanut butter mixture to the flour
  mixture and knead until combined.  Knead in the peanuts. Pat the
  dough out into a 1/2-inch thickness on a cutting board. Using a
  floured 2-1/2 in. to 3-in. diameter crinkled round biscuit cutter,
  cut out rounds from the dough. Gather the scraps together and repeat
  until all the dough is used and there are 16 round.  Place 8 of the
  rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Top each round with a piece of
  the chocolate and one of the remaining circles of dough. Press the
  edges gently to seal. Bake for 17-19 minutes, or until lightly
  browned.  Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool 5 minutes.
  Using a spatula, transfer the scones to the wire rack to cool. Serve
  warm or cool completely and store in an airtight container. VARIATION
  (Randy's Preference):  Make the dough as above, omitting bittersweet
  chocolate, substituting 1/2 c. unsalted peanuts for the chopped
  peanuts and kneading in 3/4 c. semisweet chocolate chips at the same
  time. Put the dough into a 9-inch diameter circle on a baking sheet.
  With a serrated knife, cut into 8 wedges.  Bake 20-22 minutes, or
  until a cake tested or toothpick inserted into the center of a scone
  comes out clean. Cool as above and recut into wedges, if necessary.

  Make the milk chocolate layer: Line an 8-inch square baking pan with
  plastic wrap, leaving a 2-inch overhang
  
  on two sides. Melt the milk chocolate according to the melting
  instructions in the Chocolate Key. In a medium bowl, using a
  hand-held electric mixer, beat the peanut butter and oil on medium
  speed until smooth. Beat in the cookie crumbs and chocolate. Scrape
  the chocolate mixture into the prepared pan. Spread with a rubber
  spatula in an even layer. Tap the pan on the counter to remove any
  air bubbles. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and freeze 20 minutes or
  until firm. Make the bittersweet chocolate layer:

  Chocolate Key. Transfer the chocolate to a large bowl. Stir in the
  oil. In a chilled large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer, beat
  the cream on high speed just until soft mounds begin to form. (Do not
  overwhip the cream. ) Using a rubber spatula, quickly fold 1/2 of the
  whipped cream into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in the
  remaining cream. Scrape the bittersweet chocolate mixture over the
  milk chocolate layer. Spread in an even layer. Tap the pan on the
  counter to remove any air bubbles. Cover the pan with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate at least 6 to 8 hours. (The cake may be prepared 2
  days in advance. ) Unmold the cake: Using the plastic wrap as
  handles, lift the cake from the pan. Slide the cake off the plastic
  wrap onto a cutting board. Dust the top of the cake with cocoa
  powder, if desired. Using a long sharp knife dipped in hot water and
  wiped dry, cut the cake into 1-inch strips. Cut each strip in half to
  make eight 4-by-1-inch bars. Allow the bars to stand at room
  temperature before serving. Arrange 2 bars on each dessert plate.

      Title: CHOCOLATE PECAN PRALINES - PRUDHOMME
 Categories: Cajun, Candies
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
  1 1/2    Sticks unsalted butter
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Packed, light brown sugar
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 c  Coarsely chopped pecans
      2 c  Whole pecan halves
      2 tb Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
 
  NOTE: Chocolate chips should be chilled.
     Assemble all the ingredients and utensils before starting to cook.
  (Measure out the chocolate chips and keep them refregerated until just
  before needed.)  You will need a large, heavy-bottomed aluminum pot or
  skillet with deep sides, a long-handled metal whisk or spoon, 2 large
  spoons (or an ice cream scoop with a manual release) and a very
  lightly greased cookie sheet. Melt the butter in the pot over high
  heat; add the sugars, milk, cream and chopped pecans.  cook 5
  minutes, whisking constantly.  reduce heat to medium, and continue
  cooking and whisking 10 minutes.
   Add the pecan halves and continue whisking and cooking until done,
  about 8 to 10 minutes.  (If the mixture smokes excessively toward end
  of cooking time, lower thge heat.) Stir in vanilla. then immediately
  drop about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips into about one-sixth of the
  batter. Stir quickly and just enough to cover some of the chips with
  batter but not nenough to allow the chips to melt.  Quickly drop the
  chocolate mixture onto the cookie sheet by heaping spoonfuls, using
  the second spoon to push the batter off the first (or use ice cream
  scoop); each praline should be about 2 inches in diameter and 1/2
  inch thick. repeat with remaining mixture, stirring briefly before
  adding more chocolate chips.  The cooled pralines should be light
  brown, opaque, somewhat chunky and crumbly. LAGNIAPPE: To clean the
  pot and utensils, boil water in the pot with the utensils in it. This
  will melt the batter off. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Cake

    1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
    1/2 c  Coconut
    1/2 c  Chocolate morsels
    2/3 c  Finely chopped pecans
      1 tb Milk
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 c  White sugar
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/3 c  Water
      1    Egg
 
  Melt 4T butter.  Stir in brown sugar, coconut, pecans, chocolate
  morsels, and milk.  Blend well and spread on the bottom of a 9 inch
  cake pan. Mix dry cake ingredients in a bowl. Add liquids and
  remaining 4 T of melted butter.  Beat until the batter is smooth.
  Pour over the pecan mixture in pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 30
  minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
   Cover with a large plate and flip.  Tap  plate and pan firmly on the
  counter. Remove cake pan and scrape any remaining topping onto the
  cake.
  
  Serve warm  with ice cream.  It is good without the ice cream but I
  serve it with vanilla ice cream scoops that are dusted with cocoa or
  with a bit of warm caramel topping garnished with pecans. Utterly
  disgraceful decadence!
  
  If you don't like coconut, omit it and use a extra 1/2 C of pecans.

      1    Moistening Syrup
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Orange Liqueur
 
  This striking and unusual dessert utilizes three flavors which
  harmonize beautifully in taste and appearance.
  
  Preparing the Sponge.  Butter a 9-inch diameter x 2 1/2 - to - inch
  deep springform pan and line the bottom with a piece of parchment
  paper, cut to fit. Process the nuts in a food processor until very
  fine. Sift the cake flour over the nuts and combine.  Whip the yolks,
  then whip in half the sugar until light in color and aerated. Whip
  the egg whites and salt on medium speed until white and opqaque.
  Increase the speed and whip in the remaining sugar.  Continue
  whipping the whites until the whites hold a firm peak. Fold the yolks
  into the whites, then fold in the pistachio mixture in two or three
  additions.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350
  degrees F about 30 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool on a rack,
  on the paper.
  
  Preparing the Ganache.  Place the chocolate in a bowl. Bring the
  cream to a boil and pour over the chocolate. Let stand 2 minutes,
  then whisk smooth and strain into another bowl. Refrigerate, whisking
  until cool, but not set.
  
  Preparing the Syrup.  Combine the water and sugar in a small pan and
  bring to a boil.  Cool and stir in the orange liqueur.
  
  Preparing the Filling.  Finely chop the peel and combine with the
  liqueur.
  
  Preparing the Whipped Cream.  Combine the cream, sugar and liqueur
  and whip on medium speed until firm.
  
  Assembling.  Using a sharp serrated knife, divide the Pistachio
  Sponge into two layers and place one on a cardboard. Moisten with
  half the syrup and spread with most of the Ganache, reserving some
  for a decoration. Drain the candied peel and distribute evenly on the
  Ganache. Cover with a layer of whipped cream. Place the second layer
  on the cream and moisten with the remaining syrup.  Cover the outside
  of the cake with the shipped cream and press the shavings against the
  side of the cake. Make a border of rosettes around the edge of the
  cake with the remaining Ganache and decorate the rosettes with
  cutouts of candied peel and some pistachios. Place some chipped
  pistachios in the center and dust them lightly with confectioners'
  sugar.

      Title: CHOCOLATE POTS DE CREME
 Categories: Chocolate, Desserts
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Light Cream
      2 oz German Cooking Chocolate *
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      1 x  Dash Salt
      2 ea Large Beaten Egg Yolks
    1/4 ts Vanilla
      1 x  Whipped Cream (Opt.)
 
  *    German cooking chocolate should be coarsely chopped.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- In a small nonmetal bowl stir together light
  cream, chopped chocolate, sugar and salt. Micro-cook, uncovered, on
  100% power about 1 1/2 minutes or till chocolate is melted, stirring
  every 30 seconds. Stir about HALF of the hot mixture into the beaten
  egg yolks. Return all to the bowl, mixing well. Micro-cook,
  uncovered, on 50% power for 2 to 3 minutes or till thickened,
  stirring every 30 seconds. Stir in vanilla. Pour into 2 pot de creme
  cups or 6-ounce custard cups.  Cover and chill for several hours or
  till firm. Garnish with whipped cream, if desired. NOTE: ~----
  SELECTING THE RIGHT CHOCOLATE:  You'll find three basic types of
  chocolate in the baking supplies department of most
  supermarkets--semisweet chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, and sweet
  chocolate.  The semisweet chocolate is made from chocolate that is
  just slightly sweetened with sugar. Unsweetened chocolate is the
  original baking or cooking chocolate and has no added flavorings or
  sugar.  And sweet chocolate, such as the German cooking chocolate
  used in the Chocolate Pots de Creme recipe, is chocolate mixed with
  sugar and sometimes additional cocoa butter or flavorings.

  1. Day before serving, prepare and assemble Chocolate Cake and Pud-
  ding. To prepare Chocolate Cake, grease a 10-inch springform pan;
  sprinkle inside greased pan with 2 tablespoons sugar. In medium-size
  bowl, sift together flour, cocoa, and baking powder; set aside.
  
  2. Heat oven to 350F. In large bowl, with electric mixer, beat eggs
  and rema@g 3/4 C sugar until double in volume 5 minutes. To prepare
  cake batter, gently fold flour mixture into egg mixture just until
  combined. Pour batter into prepared springform pan and bake cake 20
  to 25 minutes or until center springs back when gently pressed with
  fingertip.
  
  3. Cool cake in pan on wire rack 10 minutes. Remove cake from pan and
  cool completely on wire rack.
  
  4. To prepare Pudding, in 2-quart saucepan, heat cream to boiling. In
  large bowl, with wire whisk, beat egg yolks and sugar until well com-
  bined. Slowly beat hot cream into yolk mixture and pour all back into
  saucepan. Cook cream mixture over low heat until pudding coats a
  spoon. (Do not boil.) Remove pudding from heat and stir in chocolate
  chips until mixture is smooth. Cool to room temperature.
  
  5. To assemble Chocolate Pudding Cake, cut cake horizontally into 3
  equal slices. Line inside of cleaned springform pan with aluminum
  foil. Place top layer of cake in bottom of springform pan. Pour
  one-third of pudding over cake layer in pan. Top with middle cake
  layer and half of remaining pudding. Place bottom cake layer, bottom
  side up, in pan and top with remaining pudding. Cover loosely with
  plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight.
  
  6. Heat oven to 300'F. Place springform pan with cake into large

  9. To serve, remove side of springform pan and slice cake into wedges;
  place each wedge onto dessert plate. Top cake wedges with chocolate
  sauce and Chocolate Curls, if desired.
  
  Making Chocolate Curls
  
  Leave block or square of white or semisweet chocolate in warm room
  (800 to 85'F) for several hours or heat, repeatedly, in microwave
  oven 7 to 8 seconds just enough to soften chocolate slightly). Place
  softened square or block against paper towel in one hand; using a
  sharp vegetable peeler, dig one blade into edge or side of chocolate
  (depending on how wide you want your curls) and bring peeler towards
  you; chocolate should come off in curls. If chocolate is too cold it
  will splinter; if too warm it will not curl.

  1. Day before serving, prepare and assemble Chocolate Cake and Pud-
  ding. To prepare Chocolate Cake, grease a 10-inch springform pan;
  sprinkle inside greased pan with 2 tablespoons sugar. In medium-size
  bowl, sift together flour, cocoa, and baking powder; set aside.
  
  2. Heat oven to 350F. In large bowl, with electric mixer, beat eggs
  and rema@g 3/4 C sugar until double in volume 5 minutes. To prepare
  cake batter, gently fold flour mixture into egg mixture just until
  combined. Pour batter into prepared springform pan and bake cake 20
  to 25 minutes or until center springs back when gently pressed with
  fingertip.
  
  3. Cool cake in pan on wire rack 10 minutes. Remove cake from pan and
  cool completely on wire rack.
  
  4. To prepare Pudding, in 2-quart saucepan, heat cream to boiling. In
  large bowl, with wire whisk, beat egg yolks and sugar until well com-
  bined. Slowly beat hot cream into yolk mixture and pour all back into
  saucepan. Cook cream mixture over low heat until pudding coats a
  spoon. (Do not boil.) Remove pudding from heat and stir in chocolate
  chips until mixture is smooth. Cool to room temperature.
  
  5. To assemble Chocolate Pudding Cake, cut cake horizontally into 3
  equal slices. Line inside of cleaned springform pan with aluminum
  foil. Place top layer of cake in bottom of springform pan. Pour
  one-third of pudding over cake layer in pan. Top with middle cake
  layer and half of remaining pudding. Place bottom cake layer, bottom
  side up, in pan and top with remaining pudding. Cover loosely with
  plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight.
  
  6. Heat oven to 300'F. Place springform pan with cake into large
  roasting pan and remove plastic wrap. Pour enough boiling water into
  roasting pan to come half way up side of springform pan. Bake Choco-
  late Pudding Cake 1 hour or until top of cake is glazed over.
  
  7. Cool cake in pan on wire rack 15 minutes. Cover loosely and
  refriger- ate until well chilled.
  
  8. Just before serving, prepare Sauce: In 2-quart saucepan, heat
  cream to boiling. Remove pan from heat and stir in chocolate and
  Grand Marnier until smooth. Strain sauce and keep warm. If desired,
  prepare Chocolate Curls.
  
  9. To serve, remove side of springform pan and slice cake into wedges;
  place each wedge onto dessert plate. Top cake wedges with chocolate
  sauce and Chocolate Curls, if desired.
  
  Making Chocolate Curls  Leave block or square of white or semisweet
  chocolate in warm room (800 to 85'F) for several hours or heat,
  repeatedly, in microwave oven 7 to 8 seconds just enough to soften
  chocolate slightly). Place softened square or block against paper
  towel in one hand; using a sharp vegetable peeler, dig one blade into
  edge or side of chocolate (depending on how wide you want your curls)
  and bring peeler towards you; chocolate should come off in curls. If
  chocolate is too cold it will splinter; if too warm it will not curl.

      Title: CHOCOLATE RAISIN BREAD PUDDING W/WHITE CHOCOL
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------BREAD PUDDING----------------------------
     10 sl Raisin bread; about 1 lb
      3 c  Half-and-half
      2 c  Whole milk
      6 oz Milk chocolate; coarse chopd
      4 lg Eggs
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Mandarin orange liqueur; OR
           -other orange liqueur
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
           Dash salt
      5 oz Bittersweet chocolate;
           -coarsely chopped

MMMMM--------------------CREME FRAICHE SAUCE-------------------------
     10 oz Creme fraiche or sour cream
  2 1/2 oz White chocolate; finely
           -grated or shaved
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
 
  Preheat oven to 300 F. Lay the bread slices on the upper rack of the
  oven in a single layer. Toast 5 to 7 minutes or until crisp and very
  light golden brown. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature.
  Cut or break into 1-inch-square pieces (you should have 9 or 10 cups
  of toasted bread cubes) and set aside, uncovered, in a very large
  bowl for up to 2 days, if desired.
  
  In a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the half-and-half, milk
  and milk chocolate. Heat over moderately low heat for 3 to 4 minutes,
  stirring frequently, until the chocolate just melts. Mix well, remove
  from the heat and cool slightly.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F. Generously grease a shallow 4-quart glass
  mixing bowl or casserole dish; set aside.
  
  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, liqueur, vanilla extract and
  salt together until smooth and fully blended. Slowly add the reserved
  chocolate-cream mixture, whisking constantly until smooth and
  thoroughly mixed. Pour over the bread cubes and toss gently. Let
  stand at room temperature for approximately 1 hour, pressing the
  bread down into the liquid every 15 to 20 minutes to promote even
  saturation. Add the bittersweet chocolate and mix gently.
  
  Turn the mixture into the prepared bowl and place on the middle rack
  of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 325 F and
  bake 55 minutes to 1 hour longer, rotating the baking dish from time
  to time, until the outside edges are slightly firm and the center
  barely jiggles when shook.  Remove from the oven and let stand at
  room temperature for 10 to 12 minutes before serving.
  
  To make the White Chocolate Creme Fraiche Sauce: In a medium bowl,
  combine the creme fraiche, white chocolate and cinnamon; mix well.
  The sauce can be prepared up to 3 days in advance and stored in a
  tightly sealed container in the refrigerator. Remove from the
  refrigerator at least 30 minutes before serving.
  
  To serve, spoon the warm pudding into serving bowls and drizzle with
  the sauce. Serve immediately.
  
  To reheat just a portion of the bread pudding: Using a shallow baking
  pan, arrange the desired amount in a 1-inch-thick layer and sprinkle
  with hot water. Cover loosely with foil and warm in a 350 F oven 7 to
  10 minutes or until warmed through.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Granulated sugar
    1/4 ts Double acting baking powder
      4 tb Heavy cream
    1/8 ts Salt
      2 tb Cold unsalted butter
           Cut into bits
      2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 c  Raspberries
      2 tb Granulated sugar, or to
           Taste
      1 tb Framboise, or to taste
    1/3 c  Well-chilled heavy cream
           Connfectioners sugar for
           Sprinkling
           Mint sprigs for garnish if
           Desired
 
  From Gourmet/May 1991 For the shortcakes
      Make the shortcakes:  In a bowl sift together the cocoa powder,
  the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, baking soda, and salt, add
  butter, and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Add the
  cream and stir the mixture with a fork until it forms a dough. Divide
  the dough in half, arrange each half in a mound on a lightly greased
  baking sheet, and bake the shortcakes in the middle of a 425 oven for
  12 min., or until a tester inserted in the centers come out with
  crumbs clinging to it. Transfer to a rack to cool.
  
  In a bowl mash 3/4 cup of the raspberries with a fork, stir in 1
  tbsp. of the granulated sugar and the framboise, stirring until the
  sugar is dissolved, and stir in the remaining 3/4 cup raspberries. In
  a small bowl with an electric mixer beat the cream until it holds
  soft peaks, add the remaining 1 tbsp. granulated sugar, and beat the
  cream until it holds stiff peaks. Cut the shortcakes in half.(The
  shortcakes are delicate and crumble easily.)  Top each bottom half
  with half the raspberry mixture, divide the whipped cream between the
  2 shortcakes. With a spatula carefully top each serving with the top
  half of a shortcake. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar and garnish
  with mint. Serves: 2 Shared By: Pat Stockett

      Title: CHOCOLATE ROSES
 Categories: Chocolate, Valentine
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     10 oz Chocolate (chopped chunks
           Or chips)
    1/3 c  Light corn syrup
 
  Chocolate modeling clay is made by combining melted chocolate and
  light corn syrup. American pastry chefs invented the recipe and have
  been using this delicious edible clay to make garnishes and unique
  decorations. Here is their secret!
  
  Note: the chocolate can be substituted with almond bark, or colored
  candy disks to create different colored flowers
  
  Clay:
  
  Melt he chocolate in a microwave for 1 minute. Stir. If chocolate is
  not completely melted, return to the microwave for 30 seconds at a
  time and stir until smooth. If you don't have a microwave, place the
  chocolate in the top of a double broiler over hot water and stir
  until melted. When the chocolate is melted, add the corn syrup and
  blend. Pour the mixture onto a waxed paper sheet.Spread the chocolate
  with your fingers until it's about 1/2 inch thick. Cover loosely with
  waxed paper and let it stiffen for at least a couple hours or
  overnight. The chocolate will become very pliable.
  
  Making a Chocolate Rose:
  
  Have the kids roll 10 marble-sized balls out of the chocolate clay.
  Place the balls on a waxed paper sheet, about 1 inch apart. Place
  another waxed paper sheet on top. Big or little thumbs can press each
  marble into a flat disk (about the size of a quarter). Use some
  pressure!
  
  To form the rose:
  
  Remove 1 disk and curl it into a "teepee" shape, narrow at the top and
  wider at the bottom. Wrap the next disk around the opening of the
  teepee and the third disk at the back of the teepee. This is the rose
  bud. Continue adding disks which will look like petals. Continue to
  layer them to create a rose in bloom. Roses can be used as edible
  decorations for a cake or to create a basketful of blooms. They will
  harden after a few days and can be saved by storing in a cool, dry
  place.
  
  Since this recipe is the consistency of modeling clay, you can mold
  any shape you want.
  
  Important note: Adult supervision and participation is required for
  this activity.

      Title: CHOCOLATE ROULAGE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      9 oz Sweet cooking chocolate
      9 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
     13 c  Cold water
      8    Eggs; separated
      1 c  Sugar
           Cocoa
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
      3 tb Confectioners' sugar; sifted
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Oil the bottom of a 15 1/z x lO 1/2h x 1-inch jelly roll pan. Cut a
  piece of waxed paper to fit the width of pan and extend about 1 inch
  over ends. Place the chocolates and the water in the top of a double
  boiler over hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon until the chocolate
  is melted, then cool. Place the egg yolks in a large mixer bowl and
  beat slightly with the mixer, Add the sugar gradually, beating
  constantly until all the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is thick
  and of a batter consistency. Stir in the chocolate with a rubber
  spatula until well combined and free of streaks. Beat the egg whites
  until stiff peaks form. Fold about 1/3 of the egg whites into the
  chocolate mixture thoroughly to lighten, then fold in the remaining
  egg whites carefully but completely with a rubber spatula. Spread the
  batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake in a preheated 350 - degree
  oven for 18 minutes. Remove from oven and cover top with damp towels.
  Let stand for 30 minutes or until cooled. Remove the towels
  carefully, then loosen by lifting the extending ends of waxed paper.
  Place cocoa in a fine sieve and dust top generously. Place a piece of
  waxed paper over the top, then place a cookie sheet on top and
  invert. Peel the waxed paper carefully from the cake. Place the cream
  in a large mixer bowl and beat with an electric mixer until soft
  peaks form. Sprinkle in the confectioners' sugar and beat until
  stiff. Stir in the vanilla. Spread the whipped cream evenly over the
  cake. Roll the cake from the long side, as for a jelly roll, directly
  onto a serving tray. Roll with care as this cake is extremely tender.
  Dust the top generously with cocoa. You may refrigerate the roll for
  several hours before serving. Cut into slices to serve.

  into a separte bowl & set aside. Whisk remaining batter w/the
  chocolate, then stir over hot water until smooth. Take springform pan

  absolutely horrible, but tastes great. It is also one of those
  recipes that is a classic but you can never find in most cookbooks.
  I have fooled my kids with this as well as seen it done on TV.
  Everyone thinks that the sauerkraut is coconut. So be sure to rinse
  and drain the sauerkraut several times when you make this recipe.

  OK for a few days but haven't tested any longer than a week.
  
  Mix chocolate pudding according to directions on package using nonfat
  milk. Cool thoroughly.  Mix peanut butter with pudding. Drop 1 Tbsp.
  onto 1 square graham gracker.  Place (1 Tbsp ?) low-calorie whipped
  topping on top of pudding mixture, cover with second graham cracker
  square. Freeze until ready to use.

           Chocolate -- melted
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare a cookie sheet with cooking spray. In a
  mixing bowl, beat margarine, sugar, egg white, chocolate, and vanilla
  until well blended.  Beat in flour andsalt until dough is smooth,
  scraping down side of bowl frequently with rubber spatula. Spoon
  dough into cookie press fitted with template of desired shape. Press
  cookies 2 " apart onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake 10 to 12 minutes,
  or until firm. NOTES : When baking on metal , especially at high
  temperatures, cookies have a tendency to brown on the bottoms before
  centers are done. By stacking two baking sheets together you put an
  extra layer of metal under them as well as a thin cushion of air. The
  effect is to slow the heat and allow more even baking. Recipe By

 Categories: Breads, Chocolate, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Lt brown sugar, firmly
           -packed
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter, chilled
    3/4 c  Peanut butter, creamy
    1/4 c  Milk
      2 lg Eggs
      2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Unsalted peanuts, chopped
  1 1/2 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
           -broken into 8 equal pieces
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  
  In a lg bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and
  salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and distribute them over the
  flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives used scissors
  fashion, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
  In a sm bowl, stir together the peanut butter mixture to the flour
  mixture and knead until combined.  Knead in the peanuts.
  
  Pat the dough out into a 1/2-inch thickness on a cutting board. Using
  a floured 2-1/2 in. to 3-in. diameter crinkled round biscuit cutter,
  cut out rounds from the dough. Gather the scraps togvether and repeat
  until all the dough is used and there are 16 round. Place 8 of the
  rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Top each round with a piece of
  the chocolate and one of the remaining circles of dough. Press the
  edges gently to seal. Bake for 17-19 minutes, or until lightly
  browned. Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool 5 minutes.
  Using a spatula, transfer the scones to the wire rack to cool. Serve
  warm or cool completely and store in an airtight container.
  
  VARIATION (Randy's Preference):  Make the dough as above, omitting
  bittersweet chocolate, substituting 1/2 c unsalted peanuts for the
  chopped peanuts and kneading in 3/4 c semisweet chocolate chips at
  the same time. Put the dough into a 9-inch diameter circle on a
  baking sheet. With a serrated knife, cut into 8 wedges. Bake 20-22
  minutes, or until a cake tested or toothpick inserted into the center
  of a scone comes out clean. Cool as above and recut into wedges, if
  necessary.

  or until melted.	Cool.
  
  Beat egg yolks with electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add sugar
  and continue beating until mixture is pale yellow, about 5 minutes.
  Stir in the cooled chocolate mixture.
  
  Beat egg whites with salt until they form stiff peaks. Stir 1/5 egg
  whites into chocolate mixture to lighten and then pour chocolate
  mixture into egg whites. Gently fold whites and chocolate together
  until no white shows. Pour batter into prepared jelly roll pan. Bake
  for 14 minutes.
  
  Truffle Cream. Place chocolate in bowl, and place in 200 degree oven
  for 15 minutes or until melted.  Heat heavy cream in saucepan until
  hot. Slowly pour hot cream over melted chocolate, and stir until
  smooth and shiny. Strain mixture into bowl and cool to room
  temperature.
  
  Tiles. Place chocolate in bowl and place in 200 degree oven for 15
  minutes or until melted. Place wax paper down the length of a 17 x
  14-inch baking pan. Secure end with dab of softened butter. Pour
  melted chocolate on wax paper, and with a metal spatula spread it out
  the length of the baking pan.
  
  Refrigerate chocolate for 1 hour.  Remove chocolate and leave it at
  room temperature for 5 minutes.  Cut chocolate into three strips, one
  3 1/4 inches wide, and two strips 2 1/2 inches wide. Cut strips
  crosswise into 3/4-inch sections to make tiles. Refrigerate until
  needed.
  
  Continued from Chocolate Tile Cake - Part I.  It may be long, but it's
  worth the effort.
  
  Refrigerate Truffle Cream, mixing bowl and beaters for 1 hour.	Over
  the top of the Souffle Cake, sift unsweetened cocoa. Cover the cake
  (leave in pan) with a sheet of wax paper and cookie sheet. Invert
  cake onto them. Remove jelly roll pan and wax paper. Slip out cookie
  sheet. Trim rough edges of cake. Divide cake lengthwise into 3 equal
  strips about 3 1/4 inches each.
  
  Remove the Truffle Cream, mixing bowl and beaters from refrigerator.
  Place 2 1/3 cups cream in mixing bowl.	Return remainder to
  refrigerator. Beat about 1 1/2 minutes. Place one strip of cake on
  cookie sheet.	Spread 1/2 of beaten cream on cake, top cream with
  second cake strip. Place remainder beaten cream over top and cover
  with last cake strip. Trim any rough edges and chill cake for 1/2
  hour. Chill clean mixing bowl and beaters.
  
  Beat remaining Truffle Cream in chilled bowl for 1 1/2 minutes.
  Remove cake from refrigerator and spread cream over top and sides.
  
  Remove tiles from refrigerator.  Trim the tiles to fit height of
  cake.	Using sharp knife, separate 3 strips of tile. Place the 3
  1/4-inch tile over top of cake. Leave wax paper on. Place the two
  remaining strips along sides of cake. Try to align side and top
  tiles. Cover cake tightly with aluminum foil and refrigerate over
  night.
  
  Remove cake from refrigerator. Remove foil.  Trim off ends of cake.
  Place cake on serving dish.  Peel off strips of wax paper. Place
  narrow strips of foil diagonally on top of cake to form pattern, and
  sift confectioners sugar over it. Lift off foil. Serve with Creme de
  Menthe Custard Sauce.

      Title: CHOCOLATE TOFFEE
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 64 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Light corn syrup
  1 1/2 c  Half-and-half
  1 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           - melted
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 pn Salt
 
  COMBINE THE SUGAR, CORN SYRUP, and 1/2 cup of cream in a large
  saucepan set over moderate heat. Stir the mixture until the sugar
  dissolves completely. Insert a candy thermometer, reduce the heat to
  low, and cook the syrup, stirring frequently, until the thermometer
  registers 238F. Blend in another 1/2 cup of the cream, which will
  cause the temperature to drop, and continue to cook and stir until
  the thermometer reaches 236F or until a bit of the hot toffee dropped
  into a little cold water forms a soft, pliable ball. Mix in the
  remaining 1/2 cup cream and the melted chocolate. Cook the toffee,
  stirring constantly, lest it scorch. Cook toffee until the mixture
  becomes quite thick: A drop of it should firm up quickly in cold
  water. (NOTE: Even though the temperature of the toffee may not
  exceed 230F, if it firms in cold water, remove the pan from the heat
  at once.) Quickly mix in the vanilla and salt, then pour the toffee
  into a well-buttered 8-by-8-by-2-inch pan. Cool the toffee
  completely, then cut it into 1-inch squares. Wrap each one in waxed
  paper or plastic wrap.

  Put all the ingredients for the caramel - except the vanilla - into a
  saucepan. Over a moderate heat, stir until the butter has melted and
  the sugar dissolved completely. Then bring the mixture to the boil
  and boil for 5 to 7 minutes.
  
  Take the pan off the heat, stir in the vanilla and continue stirring
  for 2-3 minutes to cool it slightly. Then pour it over the shortbread.
  
  Leave to cool completely.
  
  To finish, melt the chocolate over hot water (no overheat !!) and
  pour it over the caramel layer.
  
  When it is cool, mark into squares with a sharp knife (makes 12 - 16).

  into the prepared pie plate. Place the pie plate on the center rack
  of the oven. On the bottom rack, place a baking pan filled halfway
  with water. Bake for 1 hour. While the cake is baking, combine all
  the topping ingredients in a small bowl and whisk thoroughly. When
  the cake has cooked for an hour, remove it from the oven, spread the
  topping on evenly, decorate if you wish, and return it to the oven.
  Bake for about 10 minutes more, until the topping sets. Refrigerate
  for 2 hours before serving. Decorate with the Chocolate Sauce Design
  if you wish. Making a Chocolate Sauce Design: Put a mixture of 2
  tablespoons pure maple syrup and 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
  powder into a squeeze bottle or an improvised pastry bag, which can
  be made by forcing the sauce into a bottom corner of a sturdy plastic
  storage bag and pricking a small hole throught which it can flow.
  Squeeze a series of straight lines across the cake, then rake the
  tines of a fork across the top in the opposite direction to create a
  pattern.

  2 1/2 tb Light corn syrup
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
        pn Salt
    3/4 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 ts Instant coffee powder
      1 ts Hot water
    1/4 c  Powdered sugar
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
 
  Preheat oven to 350'F. Grease (or spray with non-stick cooking spray)
  three 8" or 8 1/2" round cake pans.
  
  In a small, heavy saucepan over lowest heat, melt chocolate, stirring
  constantly until smooth; be careful not to scorch. Set aside. Sift
  together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt
  onto a sheet of wax paper. In a large mixer bowl, with mixer set on
  medium speed, beat oil, butter and sugar until very well blended and
  fluffy. Beat in chocolate. One at a time, beat in egg, then whites,
  coffee and vanilla until smoothly incorporated. Gently stir half of
  the dry ingredients, then yogurt into the mixture just until mixed.
  Stir in remaining dry ingredients just until well blended and smooth.
  Divide batter among pans, spreading in edges.
  
  Bake in the middle of the oven for 23-28 minutes, or until tops are
  almost firm when tapped and a toothpick inserted in the center comes
  out moist but clean. Transfer pans to racks and let stand until
  completely cooled. Layers may be wrapped airtight and frozen for
  later use. Let return to room temperature before using. Or frost cake
  and serve immediately, if desired. Makes 10-12 servings.

  FLUFFY CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Place egg whites in a large mixer bowl.
  Set the bowl in a large bowl of very hot tap water and let stand for
  10 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small heavy saucepan set over
  low heat, melt chocolate, stirring constantly, until smooth; be very
  careful not to scorch. Set aside to cool slightly.
  
  Combine the corn syrup, 1/4 cup water and the sugar in a 2-quarter
  saucepan, stirring until well blended. Bring to a simmer over
  medium-heat heat. Cover and boil for 2 minutes to allow steam to wash
  any sugar from pan sides. Uncover and continue simmering, without
  stirring, until mixture bubbles loudly and reaches 244-245'F on a
  candy thermometer (about 1 1/2 minutes). (To test without a candy
  thermometer, drop a teaspoon of syrup into ice water; when cooked to
  the proper temperature the syrup will form a firm ball that holds its
  shape when squeezed.) Immedately remove pan from heat and set aside.
  
  With mixer set on medium speed, beat egg whites until very frothy and
  opaque. Raise speed to high and beat until whites just begin to stand
  in soft peaks; be careful not to overbeat. Meanwhile, return syrup to
  burner and reheat just to boiling. Beating whites on high speed,
  immediately begin pouring boiling syrup in a stream down the side of
  the bowl (avoid beaters or syrup will stick to them or be thrown onto
  bowl side), pouring rapidly enough that all the syrup is incorporated
  in about 15 seconds. Add salt and continue beating on high speed
  until the mixture is stiffened, glossy and cooled to barely warm.
  Beat in vanilla and coffee mixture until evenly incorporated. Sift
  powdered sugar and cocoa onto a sheet of wax paper. A bit at a time,
  whisk into egg-white mixture. Whisk in melted chocolate just until
  smoothly incorporated.
  
  Frost cake immediately, or store frosting airtight for up to 48 hours.
  Frosting may soften and gradually deflate upon longer standing.

  cooked.). Let cake cool completely. Sift or sprinkle powdered sugar
  over top of cooled cake.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 oz Hazelnuts or Hazelnut pieces
     10    Hazelnuts to decorate cake
      3 oz Caster Sugar
      4 oz Self-Raising Flour
      3    Eggs
      2 ts Instant Coffee
      2 tb Soya Oil
      1 ts Baking Powder

MMMMM--------------------BUTTER CREAM FILLING-------------------------
      2 oz Softened butter
      4 oz Icing Sugar
      1 ts Instant Coffee Powder
           -dissolved in 1 Tablespoon
           -of water
 
  Dissolve the instant coffee in two tablespoons of water. Put the 3
  ounces of hazelnuts into a food processor and grind them to a fine
  powder. Add all the other ingredients and whiz until you have a
  lovely creamy mixture.
  
  Grease and flour a 7-inch sandwich tin and pour in the mixture,
  smoothing the top down. Pre-heat the oven to Gas Mark 4, 350F, 180C,
  and bake for about 25 minutes, until the cake is brown and has shrunk
  away from the sides of the tin.
  
  To make the butter cream filling, all you do is either beat together
  the butter, icing sugar and coffee until you have a smooth cream.
  When the cake is ready, turn it out onto a rack, and when it has
  cooled, split it into two and sandwich it together with the butter
  cream filling. Alternatively, fill it with apricot jam and spread the
  butter cream over the cake and decorate with the whole hazelnuts.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour, all purpose
    1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
    1/2 c  Cocoa powder
      3 oz Butter; chilled
      1    Egg
      6 oz Semisweet chocolate; chopped
      2 c  Whipping cream
      2    Raspberry boxes;I assume
           -they mean pints, I would
           -use 3-4 cups
 
  CHOCOLATE PASTRY: Combine flour, sugar & cocoa in work bowl of a food
  processor. Pulse 2 or 3 times to aerate. Chop the butter into pieces
  and distribute over the flour. Process until mixture reassembles
  coarse meal, do NOT overprocess. With motor running, drop in whole
  egg (no we do not mean the shell too) through the feed tube. Process
  very briefly - do not let the dough come together or your pastry will
  be tough. Remove the dough from work bowl and set aside at room
  temperature until the filling is made. TRUFFLE FILLING: Place the
  chopped chocolate in a medium size bowl, bring the cream to boil over
  medium-high heat. Pour over the chocolate and whisk till all the
  chocolate is melted. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
  set. Preheat the oven to 375F. Work the chocolate pastry with your
  hands and press it into an 8" or (" tart pan with removable bottom;
  try to get an even thickness. Chill for 20 minutes. Prick the bottom
  of the pastry with a fork. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25
  minutes. Cool completely. TO ASSEMBLE: Remove the tart gently form
  the pan and set it on a platter. Spoon over pipe the truffle filling
  into the shell and smooth the surface. Arrange the raspberries over
  the top in concentric circles. Serve at room Temperature for the
  fullest flavour. Anne's note: I would not make this on very hot days
  as the filling might melt. SERVES: 6

      Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES (FRENCH-STYLE)
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 5 Pounds
 
      3 lb Chocolate (semi-sweet
           -or semi-bittersweet)
      1 qt Cream, very heavy
    1/2 lb Butter, sweet (i.e.
           -unsalted butter)
           Cocoa powder
 
  Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler.  Do not cook the
  chocolate. This should be done SLOWLY over minimum heat.
  
  Boil the cream.  Once the chocolate is completely melted and the
  cream just boiled, combine in the top of the double boiler. Take off
  the top pan from the water, and (off heat) mix until completely
  combined. Keep stirring until it is relatively cool. Allow to sit
  until it is cool enough to put into a refrigerator.
  
  Refrigerate overnight (NO SHORT CUTS HERE!!!).
  
  The next morning, melt this wonderful mixture again in a double
  boiler. When it is completely melted again, mix in the butter until
  it is completely absorbed. Whip, either with a hand whisk or a very
  slow electric gizmo, until the butter is completely absorbed and the
  mixture is cool again.  This can take an hour or longer, depending
  upon the chocolate, etc. Let cool and refrigerate overnight once more
  (this is not as critical as the first cooling; a few hours will be
  enough).
  
  Heat once again and whip until cool.   Refrigerate until it is thick
  enough to pipe through a pastry bag. Using a 1/2 nozzle, make little
  balls on a big piece of parchment paper that has cocoa powder spread
  on it. Roll in the powder. Keep chilled until just before serving.
  Let them return to just above room temperature before eating.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  French-style chocolate confectionery -- For those of you who are
  crazy enough about chocolate to go to the extremes that I do, here is
  the recipe for the chocolate truffles that I make. The formula is
  taken from Paul Bocuse's "French Cooking," but the directions are my
  own.
  
  *  If you like Grand Marnier or Kahlua or rum or whatever in your
  chocolate, the last melting step is the time to add. I think it's a
  small but forgivable sin myself.
  
  *  I recommend Guittard chocolate.  You can buy their semisweet chips
  in 12 ounce bags.  You can also buy it in 10 pound bars. You can also
  buy 10-pound bars of Guittards "French Vanilla Semi bittersweet"
  which is so good you might eat all of it before you cook with it.
  Guittard makes 5 types of bittersweet if you like you chocolate
  really bitter. I use Hershey's Cocoa. Still the best for my taste.
  
  *  Use genuine, real-live, honest "heavy cream" and not
  ultra-pasteurized whipping cream.  Try a wholesale dairy. I only use
  Challenge Sweet Butter. Under no circumstances should you use
  anything but unsalted butter in this recipe.
  
  : Difficulty:  quite difficult (melting the chocolate 3 times requires
  tremendous care).
  : Time:  3 or 4 hours of preparation during a 3-day period.
  : : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES II
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 10 Dozen
 
      2 lb Dark, coating chocolate
      6 oz Chocolate, unsweetened,
           -baking (or more, to taste)
      3 oz Butter, unsalted
  1 1/4 c  Cointreau
 
  Chop the chocolate.  Melt together with the butter over simmering
  water. Stir continuously with a rubber spatula. Don't let water get
  into the chocolate.
  
  Warm the Cointreau to the same temperature as the chocolate. Slowly
  blend the Cointreau into the chocolate (still over the water). Stir
  continuously. Do this slowly (as if you were making Hollandaise).
  Using an electric mixer, beat the mixture until cool and somewhat
  thickened. (Takes about 5 minutes; you'll need a good mixer.)
  
  Line a large baking sheet (11 x 17) with wax paper. Pour in the
  truffle mix. (This will fill the pan.) Chill in the refrigerator
  until solid (several hours).
  
  Use a pizza cutter to cut the stuff into strips (peel off the wax
  paper first), then into squares.  Take each one, mash it in your
  palm, and roll in cocoa. Chill some more.
  
  I recommend Merckens Yucatan or Lindt Extra Bittersweet for the dark
  coating chocolate. In place of the Cointreau, try substituting other
  liqueurs (Chambord, Amaretto, Kahlua) and coatings (chopped roasted
  almonds, finely chopped candied orange peel, coffee beans run through
  a nutmeg grinder, etc.)
  
  Truffles rolled in cocoa are "classic", here are some rough and ready
  instructions for coating anything with chocolate, abstracted from
  "Making Chocolates" by Alec Leaver, published in 1975 by Weathervane
  Books by arrangement with Michael Joseph Ltd.  (The book is out of
  print.)
  
  Melt some chocolate over hot water, let it cool slowly until it just
  thickens (80-84 F). Now warm the chocolate gently and slowly until it
  thins slightly. The temperature should be above 85, but below 91.
  This maximum working temperature is absolutely crucial. The
  temperature of the room you work in should not exceed 70.
  
  Pre-bottom all centers, that is, smear a little couverature on what
  will be the bottom of the center with the back of a spoon and place
  it, bottom side up, on a plate. This lets you check that the
  couverature is properly tempered.
  
  After the bases have set and hardened a little, stir the couverature
  thoroughly, trying not to get too many air-bubbles in. Drop a center
  into the couverature, bottom down and, with an ordinary fork,
  slightly warmed, push it down to submerge it fully. Immediately, pick
  it out with the fork, tap the fork on the side of the bowl in order
  to settle the chocolate, and wipe any excess from underneath the
  fork. Transfer the center to a sheet of wax paper. Stir the
  couverature after depositing each center to keep it well mixed.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Classic chocolate confectionery -- These are as good, or better,
  than anything you can buy in a store.
  
  *  The basis of the truffle centre is ganache paste, a mixture of
  melted chocolate and warm cream well blended and cooled until it
  hardens. Orange, honey, peppermint, rum or vanilla can be added to
  give flavor, but it is important that the final mixture should be
  hard enough to be moulded to shape and be capable of standing up to
  being coated with chocolate.
  
  *  The texture of ganache paste depends upon the kinds of cream and
  chocolate and the proportions in which they are used. Plain chocolate
  is harder than milk chocolate, so more cream can be added to it.
  Single cream is thinner than double so must be used in smaller
  quantities. Incorporating cream or other liquids fulfills two
  functions: it softens the chocolate and it gives flavor. After the
  centre has been made and moulded to shape, it is coated with
  chocolate to seal it and help to keep it moist. It is then rolled in
  a final decorative coating, and this can cocoa sweetened with a
  little icing sugar, or chopped mixed nuts.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate for classic truffles, quite difficult for
  coated centers.
  : Time:  most of a day.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES IV
 Categories: Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    190 g  Sugar
     75 g  Powdered chocolate
    125 ml Whipping cream
     60 g  Unsalted butter
 
  1.  Put all ingredients in a solid sauce-pan, mix while bringing
  slowly to the boil.
  
  2.  Boil gently.
  
  3.  After two minutes you will have a wonderful icing for cakes, and a
  sauce for ice cream.
  
  4.  After six minutes (or a little longer if you want your truffles
  harder) take sauce-pan off heat and allow the mixture to cool
  slightly. At this point you can add dark rum or any other liqueur if
  you wish. Cool in the refrigerator for about one hour.
  
  5.  Form into balls about the size of large marbles and roll them in
  powdered chocolate. Cool to room temperature, or chill.
  
  Author's Notes: I found this recipe in the flight magazine for a trip
  from London to Vienna. I think Vienna is probably the best place in
  the world for cakes and sweets. Whatever you do, never go to Vienna
  if you are on a diet. This is also the only recipe I have ever
  collected that is in cups rather than grams!
  
  Difficulty    : easy. Precision
  : measure the ingredients.

    1/2 c  Milk
      2 c  Heavy (whipping) cream
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2    Vanilla beans, split
           Lengthwise
      6    Egg yolks - room temperature
           Blended with fork

MMMMM----------------------CHOCOLATE MOUSSE---------------------------
      5 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
           Chocolate, coarsely chopped
      4 oz Unsalted butter, chopped
      4 lg Eggs* separated, at room
           Temperature
      4 tb Sugar
           Plus
      6 tb Sugar for caramelizing
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
 
  For the custard; place the milk, cream and sugar in a heavy medium
  sized saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla beans into the
  mixture and add the split skins too. Bring to a boil over medium
  heat. Remove from heat and steep for at least one hour or until the
  mixture cools to room temperature. Discard the split skins of the
  beans.
  
  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Place eight three inch ramekins in a
  large baking pan.  Pour enough water into the pan to come three
  quarters of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Remove the ramekins
  and place the baking pan with the water in the oven to preheat for
  about 15 minutes.
  
  Whisk the six egg yolks into the cooled milk mixture. Strain through
  a fine sieve into the ramekins, filling only about half full (leave
  room to add the chocolate mousse layer). Place the ramekins in the
  preheated prepared pan.  Bake in the preheated oven until set and a
  knife inserted into the custard comes out dry. *no time stated in
  recipe* Remove dishes from the water bath and cool to room
  temperature.
  
  For the chocolate mousse: melt the chocolate and butter in the top of
  a double boiler over gently simmering water until chocolate is smooth,
  stirring occasionally. Cool until tepid, about 25 minutes.
  
  Using an electric mixer, beat the four egg yolks with two tablespoons
  of the sugar until a slowly dissolving ribbon forms as the beaters
  are lifted. Fold the tepid chocolate into the yolks.
  
  Using a clean dry beater and bowl, beat the four egg whites and the
  cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add the remaining two
  tablespoons of sugar one at a time and continue beating until barely
  stiff. Gently fold half of the whites into the chocolate mixture,
  fold in the remaining whites.
  
  Spoon the chocolate mousse over the cooled baked custards, smoothing
  the tops with a spatula.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at
  least 4 to 6 hours or overnight. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes
  before serving.
  
  To serve, preheat the broiler (or use stovetop salamander or small
  propane torch).  Sprinkle a little less than one tablespoon sugar
  over each dessert.
  
  Place about two inches below the heat source and broil until the
  sugar is melted and caramelized, about two minutes, watching
  CAREFULLY. Serve immediately.
  
  NOTE:uncooked egg yolks may be contaminated with salmonella and
  should be avoided by young children, the elderly and anyone with
  immune system deficiencies.

  water 11oz tin  evaporated milk 1 tsp vanilla Chill the evaporated
  milk in the fridge for several hours. (It will not beat up well if it

  milk. Stir well, then leave to stand for 5 minutes. In a medium sized
  saucepan mix the cocoa, sugar and water. Bring to the boil, stirring
  constantly. Remove from the heat and add the softened gelatine. Stir
  until the gelatine has completely dissolved. Stand the chocolate
  mixture in cold water to cool but DO NOT let it set.  Beat the
  evaporated milk until very thick. Add the cooled chocolate mixture
  gradually, then;
  
  (a) Turn into one large dish to set.
  
  (b) Spoon into individual dishes.
  
  (c) Spoon mixture into glasses or individual dishes alternately with
  spoonfuls of whipped cream and/or raspberries or stewed peaches.
  
  (d) Spoon into a mould that has been wiped with cooking oil to prevent
  sticking.  Leave to set. Colour darkens and flavour becomes more
  marked if pudding is left for several hours.  To unmould, loosen
  edges with fingers, then loosen one side and turn onto a dampened
  plate. DO NOT stand the mould in warm water unless all else fails.

 Categories: Candies, Alcohol, Resort, Holidays
      Yield: 1 Lot
 
      1 c  Walnuts, ground or
           - finely chopped
      2 c  Grated "German's sweet" or
           - bittersweet chocolate
  1 1/2 c  Sifted confectioner's sugar
      4 tb Rum
           Cocoa powder
 
  Combine nuts, sugar, and chocolate. Moisten with rum to form a stiff
  dough. Form into small balls and roll in cocoa to coat.
  
  This recipe is not only simple, it's flexible. It can be made with
  other kinds of liquor (amaretto, sherry, and Southern Comfort work
  well), nuts (almonds or pecans, for instance) and coatings (ground
  nuts, finely grated coconut, etc.) and always comes out tasting
  great. Adding small chunks of nut for texture is also effective.
  These usually disappear in a hurry.
  
  This is a recipe for rum balls that I got from Monica Fischler in
  Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1974. It's very simple, requires no cooking,
  and is almost impossible to foul up.
