  casings OR form into patties or link shapes and cook until browned.
  Excellent for use in your basic spaghetti gravy recipe. This is also
  great just crumbled on top of pizza.  This recipe can be multiplied,
  if you wish. I usually make 4-6 pounds at a time. It freezes well.

      Title: GRANDMA'S OATMEAL BREAD (LEYENDECKER)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 pk Dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water
  1 1/2 c  Boiling water
      1 c  Old-fashioned oatmeal
    1/2 c  Light molasses
    2/3 c  Shortening
      1 tb Salt
      2    Beaten eggs
  6 1/2 c  Sifted flour (part whole
           -wheat if preferred)
      1    Egg white
      1 tb Water
           Additional oatmeal
 
  From Mrs. Ruben Leyendecker
  
  1. Soften yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine boiling water,
  oatmeal, molasses, shortening and salt. Cool to lukewarm. Stir in 2
  cups flour and beat well. Add eggs and yeast mixture and beat well.
  Add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.
  
  2. Turn out onto lightly floured surface, cover and let rest 10
  minutes. Knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. Place in lightly
  greased bowl, turning dough once. Cover with a dish towel and let
  rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch
  down. Coat 2 well-greased 8-1/2x4-1/2x2-1/2" loaf pans with 2
  tablespoons of rolled oats in each pan.
  
  3. Divide dough in half. Shape 2 loaves and place in pans. Cover. Let
  rise until almost double in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Brush with
  mixture of 1 egg white and 1 tablespoon water; sprinkle lightly with
  rolled oats. Bake at 350'F. for 40-50 minutes. Cover with foil or
  brown paper after baking 15 minutes if tops are getting too brown.

      Title: GRANDMA'S OATMEAL COOKIES
 Categories: Biscuits
      Yield: 120 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Shortening
      4 lg Eggs
      5 c  Flour
      3 c  Quick cooking oats
      2 c  Buttermilk
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
      5 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      1 c  Raisins
      4 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/2 ts Allspice
      2 ts Vanilla
 
  optional: butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, pecans for walnuts
  
  Pour 1 cup boiling water over the raisins and add 1 t baking soda.
  Stir well and set aside.
  
  Bring the shortening to room temperature then cream well. Add the
  sugar one cup at a time and cream well after each addition. Add the
  eggs in the same manner. Sift together the cinnamon, cloves,
  allspice, flour and baking powder.  Add the vanilla to the creamed
  mixture. Drain the raisins and sprinkle one tablespoon of flour over
  them and shake to coat. Alternately add the flour mixture, the milk
  and the oatmeal. Mix well after each addition.  There will a lot of
  dough and it should be fairly thick. With a heavy wooden spoon stir
  in the walnuts and the raisins and the flavored chips--you can use
  any amount of the flavored chips you want.
  
  Grease the cookie sheet.  Drop the dough by teaspoonful on the cookie
  sheet.  I usually get about 20 per sheet--but then I have very, very
  old cookie sheets and they are larger than my new ones. Bake at 350
  for 10-12 minutes.  They will be golden on the bottom and dry on the
  top. Remove and place on wax paper until cool. Keep in an airtight
  container--Tupperware is great.
  
  Makes about 10 dozen.
  
  Variation - you can save the water from soaking the raisins and cut
  down on the milk by the appropriate amount. this adds a very good
  flavor to the cookies.

  with melted butter.  Combine sugars, nuts, and cinnamon; sprinkle
  over dough. Starting with shorter side, roll up tightly. Pinch edge
  to seal. Cut into 12 slices.  Place on greased 13"x9" pan. Or cut 9
  slices, throw away the two end pieces and place in 9" round pan, with
  one in the middle and the rest arranged around the outside. (looks

 Categories: Breadmaker, Rolls
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           -DIANA LEWIS (VGWN37A)
      3 c  Bread flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
      6 tb Butter
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Powdered buttermilk
    7/8 c  Water
      2 ts Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 ts Quick rising yeast.
  1 1/2 ts Cardomon; + -
 
  Make on dough cycle. There are several ways to make these one is to
  cut into 12 to 15 equal pieces then roll each into a rope about 6 to
  8 inches long tie in a knot and pinch ends together and place pinched
  end side down in a lightly greased pan. Let rise till doubled about
  45 minutes. The other way is to cut up 36 equal pieces and roll into
  balls then place three balls into a muffin tin. Let rise as
  previously stated. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 13 to 15
  minutes till tops are a golden brown. For the sticky part after
  removal of rolls from oven brush on a mixture of melted butter about
  1 TBL and 1 Tbl sugar heated in a sauce pan till sugar is slightly
  dissolved let mixture cool some and brush on rolls. These rolls are
  just as good without. They also reheat real well. If you would like
  to make brown and serve rolls bake rolls at 250 for 20 to 30 minutes.
  DO NOT BROWN. Let them cool completely before storing (DO NOT put on
  the glaze) tops of rolls will be slightly tacky will last 5 to 7 days
  in fridge and a month in freezer to bake brown and serve preheat oven
  to 350 bake 8 minutes. This dough also make excellent cinnamon rolls
  roll out dough into a rectangle about 1/4 to 1/8 inch thick depend on
  how many and how big you want to make them. Take 1 TBL of soft butter
  and spread all around leaving 1/4 inch of edge. Then sprinkle
  cinnamon all around as much as you want then take 1/2 cup brown sugar
  and sprinkle. You can also add the same amount raisins. Roll up into
  a log and cut off about 1-1/2 to 2 inches and place in a lightly
  greased pan. Let rise 45 minutes and bake 15 to twenty minutes at
  350. when somewhat cooled drizzle on a glaze of powdered sugar,
  butter, vanilla extract and milk then devour. Happy holidays

      Title: GRANDMOTHER'S WATERMELON RIND PRESERVES
 Categories: Sauces, Preserves
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lb Watermelon rind
      2 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
      1    Lemon, sliced
      1    Cinnamon stick
      1 ts Whole cloves
 
  The texture of these preserves is firm and thick and the taste
  redolent with spices. Underripe melons are a good choice for this
  recipe because the rinds are particularly firm.
  
  Skin the rind and scrape it clean of any red flesh. Cut the rind into
  half-inch cubes. Soak overnight in a solution of 1 gallon water and
  1/2 cup salt.
  
  Drain rind and cook in fresh water for about 50 minutes, or until just
  tender when pierced with a fork. Drain well and set aside.
  
  To make the syrup, combine the remaining ingredients in a pan large
  enough to hold all the rind. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes.
  Add rind and cook until it turns transparent, about 30 minutes. Pack
  into clean glass jars, cover with hot syrup and seal. Store in the
  refrigerator for up to 3 months.
  
  Uses: This makes a wonderful condiment to serve with East Indian
  curries or any other hot and spicy dish.
  
  Makes 2 to 3 pints.

  up eating the cake. Put the components together and all that's
  missing is a tall glass of milk."
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter three 9-inch round cake pans. Whisk
  together the cocoa and the boiling water in a bowl, making a smooth
  paste. Set aside to cool.
  
  Sift together the cake flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and
  baking soda.
  
  Put the butter and brown sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. With
  the paddle attachment, cream them on medium-high speed for 2 minutes,
  until light and fluffy,
  
  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Decrease
  speed to low, and stir in the dry ingredients alternate with the
  buttermilk. Stir in the reserved cocoa paste and the vanilla.
  
  Divide the batter evenly among the 3 pans.  Bake for about 25 minutes,
  until a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean. When the
  cakes are cool, unmold them by running a knife around inside edge of
  each pan and inverting onto racks.
  
  Fill and frost with Bittersweet Chocolate Frosting, making a 3-layer
  cake.

    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
      5 tb Tomato paste (small can)
      3 tb Brown sugar
      1    Bottle beer (heck! use 2)

      1 ts Thyme

MMMMM----------------------------MEAT---------------------------------
      4 kg Browned, cubed beef

MMMMM----------------------------ROUX---------------------------------
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Oil
      1 c  Water
 
  This recipe was reduced from the original which was intended for
  about 100 people, and called for 15 pounds of potatoes, 5 gallons of
  water and other ingredients in the same grandiose proportions. The
  above combination may be varied at will; just remember to use beer
  instead of water to improve the flavours.
  
  Combine the Cubed Veggies with the Miscellaneous stuff and cook until
  the veggies are done.
  
  Add the beef and cook another 5 minutes at low simmer.
  
  Finally, add the Roux, stir well and cook over medium heat about 15
  minutes.
  
  To make the Roux, which is a thickening agent used around the world
  and named by the French, you heat the oil on medium heat and add the
  flour. Stirring constantly, slowly brown the mixture without burning
  until it turns a nice chocolatey brown. Slowly add in the cold water,
  stirring constantly until the consistency is smooth. When required,
  add to the stew and blend in well with the thinner liquid. The 15
  minutes at medium heat causes the flour to absorb a lot of the liquid
  and thicken the stew.

  fork. Form dough into a ball, flatten it slightly, dust with flour
  and chill it, wrapped in wax paper, for 1 hour. Divide dough into 2
  pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Chill the larger piece,
  wrapped in wax paper. Roll out the other, 1/8-inch thick on a floured
  surface, and fit it to a 9-inch pie plate, and trim the edge leaving
  a 1/2-inch overhang. Chill the pie shell while making the filling. In
  a large bowl, stir together 14 Tbsp sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg,
  ginger, salt, and zest. Peel, quarter, and core the apples; slice
  thinly, crosswise, and add them to the sugar mixture, tossing to coat
  well. Mound the apple mixture in the pie shell, sprinkle with lemon
  juice and dot with butter. Roll out the larger piece of dough to a 13
  or 14-inch round on a floured surface and drape it over the filling.
  Trim top crust, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Fold overhang under bottom
  crust, pressing the edge to seal it. Crimp the edge decoratively with
  a fork.  Make slits in the top crust to form steam vents. Brush with
  h&h and sprinkle with the remaining sugar. Bake pie in lower third of
  a preheated 425f oven for 15 minutes, reduce heat to 375f and bake
  for 40-45 minutes more, or until filling is bubbling and crust is
  golden. Transfer pie to a rack to cool. In a chilled bowl, beat cream

      Title: GRANNY SMITH APPLESAUCE TARTS
 Categories: Tarts, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------FOR THE APPLESAUCE--------------------------
      6 lg Granny Smith apples
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      2 tb Honey

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE PASTRY----------------------------
    3/4 c  Solid vegetable shortening
    1/4 c  Boiling (not just hot) water
      1 tb Milk
      1 tb Sugar
      2 c  All-purpose flour, sifted
 
  Peel and core the apples; cut into thin slices, to thicker than 1/4".
  Put the apples, butter, lemon juice and honey in a heavy saucepan
  with a lid. (Don't try using a lightweight pan; you need a heavy pan
  that conducts heat well.) Cover tightly; cook over high heat for 10
  minutes. Uncover. Stir to break up the apples into a smooth sauce. If
  necessary, keep cooking until the applesauce is completely smooth,
  stirring frequently to prevent burning or sticking. Set aside to
  cool. (You may cook the applesauce in advance and refrigerate. Bring
  back to room temperature before serving.)
  
  Put the shortening in a large bowl. Add the boiling water. Stir
  quickly to make a smooth mixture. Stir in the milk and sugar. Add the
  flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition, until you
  have used a total of 1 1/2 cup flour. After that, add flour only
  until the dough clings together stiffly. Form the dough into a ball.
  Flatten between sheets of wax paper, or wrap in plastic wrap and
  refrigerate for at least 1 hour, to allow the dough to "relax."
  
  After 15 minutes before you are ready to prepare the tart shells,
  remove the dough from the refrigerator. Let it soften slightly. Roll
  out the dough, either on a floured surface or between sheets of wax
  paper, to a thickness of 1/8". Cut into six 4" circles, using a
  plastic lid (such as that of the shortening can) or a cardboard
  template as a guide. (You may save any leftover dough, well-wrapped,
  in the freezer for up to
        6    weeks.)
  
  Preheat the oven to 400'F.
  
  Turn a standard muffin tin upside down and gently drape a circle of
  dough down the muffin shape, pressing in place lightly. Repeat with
  the remaining dough circles, making certain the shells don't touch
  one another (if possible, use a 12-muffin tin and skip spaces so the
  tart shells don't touch.)
  
  Bake the shells for 12-14 minutes, or until they're golden brown.
  Allow the shells to cool slightly before gently removing them from
  the muffin tin to finish cooling right side up on a wire rack. (You
  may prepare the tart shells one day ahead and store in a covered
  container.)
  
  At serving time, fill each shell with 1/3 cup room-temperature
  applesauce. If desired, drizzle with additional honey. You also may

      Title: GRANNY'S BROTH  (CAWL MARNGU) WELSH
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Best end of neck Welsh lamb
      1    Small swede (Turnip)
    1/2 lb Carrots
      1 lb Potatoes
      2    Large leeks
      1 oz Parsley
    1/2 oz Flour
           Salt and pepper
 
  Put the meat into the saucepan, cover with cold water, add salt and
  pepper, bring slowly to the boil and skin carefully. (This can be
  done the night before and the fat allowed to set on the surface. This
  makes it easier to skim off.) Then add the carrots (cut in half), the
  swede (sliced) and the white of the leeks, and simmer gently for 2 -
  2 1/2 hours. Add the potatoes (cut in four) and continue to simmer
  for another 30 minutes. When the potatoes are almost cooked, thicken
  with flour and a little water. Lastly, add the green of the leeks and
  parsley (chopped) and simmer for further 10 minutes and serve in
  basins while hot. Cawl was the dish most commonly served for dinner
  on the farm during the winter months in th ecounties of South and
  West Wales. The broth itself would be served in basins or bowls, with
  bread, and the meat and vegetables served as a second course. Croeso

  Okay - this is from an old cookbook, and you probably shouldn't try
  to make it unless you know how to cook fudge well. Of course, this is
  the only fudge I've ever made, and I get pretty good results.
  Obviously, variations can be made by adding chocolate or liquid
  flavors.
  
  Place brown sugar in pot.  Add just enough top milk [WHAT is top milk
  ~ I used the heaviest cream I could find] to moisten. Stir with a
  wooden spoon while melting over low heat. Bring to a boil without
  stirring. When big bubbles form, test for soft ball stage in cold
  water. Remove. Add blob of butter [dontcha just LOVE these exact
  measurements]. Cool 10 minutes. Add a capful of vanilla and beat hard
  until a gloss appears and then goes. Pour into a greased pan. Put on
  the porch to cool.

      Title: GRANNY'S HAM & POTATO GRATIN FOR A CROWD
 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
     10 lb "boiling" potatoes
           Salt
      8 c  Garlic and mustard sauce
      5 oz Butter
      1 c  All-purpose flour
  6 1/2 c  Hot milk
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
      1 pn Nutmeg
      2 lg Cloves of garlic, pureed
    1/4 c  Dijon-type prepared mustard
    1/2 ts Thyme or sage
      4 c  Coarsely grated cheese *
  1 1/2 qt To 2 qts cooked ham **
 
  * Swiss or a mixture such as Swiss, mozzarella, Jack, and/or Cheddar
  [I actually used all four kinds. Worked out okay. S.C.] ** diced,
  thinly sliced, or ground (to make 6 to 8 cups)
  
  Here's my contribution to the thread on scalloped potatoes and ham.
  As far as I'm concerned, no others need apply. This is the best I've
  ever tasted. It's from my new Julia Child book, "The Way to Cook".
  
  Also++since the recipe is for 18 to 24 servings++it'll give the folks
  with amount-converting recipe programs a chance to put them through
  their paces. ;-}
  
  Here is a great crowd pleaser, as well as a deliciously economical
  one that needs only a copious salad, a loaf of bread, and a jug of
  light red wine to make the meal.
  
  For 18 to 24 servings
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:
  
  A food processor is useful for slicing and grating; and 8-quart
  covered kettle; a heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan, for the sauce; a
  buttered 6-quart baking dish about 3 inches deep, for the final dish
  
  THE POTATOES:
  
  Have ready the kettle containing 4 cups of cold water. Peel the
  potatoes and slice them 1/4 inch thick, dropping them into the cold
  water to cover as you do so. Cover the kettle, and bring to the boil.
  Uncover and boil slowly for 3 to 4 minutes, until barely cooked
  through++eat several slices to check.  Drain, cover the kettle again
  for 3 to 4 minutes to firm up the potato slices, then uncover.
  
  THE GARLIC AND MUSTARD SAUCE:
  
  Make the classic white sauce; cook the butter and flour together in
  the saucepan until they foam and froth for 2 minutes without
  coloring. Off heat pour in half the hot milk; whisk vigorously to
  blend as you pour in the rest; simmer for 3 minutes, stirring. Remove
  from heat and whisk in the seasonings; bring to the simmer again;
  taste carefully, and add additional seasonings to taste.  [I didn't
  type in the sauce referred to. It was essentially a longer version of
  what's given above along with tips on handling it. S.C.]
  
  ASSEMBLING:
  
  Spoon a 1/16-inch layer of sauce on the bottom of the buttered baking
  dish. Set aside 3 cups of the sauce and 1 cup of the cheese for the
  topping. Now, to arrange everything in 4 layers, start with a quart
  of the potatoes, then a quarter of the ham, follow by a third of the
  sauce and sprinkle on a third of the cheese. Continue in layers,
  finishing the final layer with the remaining potatoes and ham; spread
  on the reserved 3 cups of sauce to cover completely, then the last of
  the cheese.
  
  AHEAD OF TIME NOTE:  May be prepared a day in advance, cover when
  cool and refrigerate.
  
  An hour or so before you plan to serve, preheat the oven to 375f.
  
  Bake in the upper third level just until the potatoes are bubbling
  hot and the top has browned nicely. About 45 minutes.
  
  AHEAD OF TIME NOTE:  May be kept warm uncovered on a hot tray but be
  sure not to overheat or the potatoes and ham will dry out.

      Title: GRANNY'S TACOS
 Categories: Main dish, Cst
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
      2 pk Corn tortilla (12 ct)
      1 lb Hamburger
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      4 cl Garlic, minced
      1 md Potato, peeled, boiled
           -and mashed, or use leftover
           Garlic salt
           Black pepper, fresh ground
           Oil for frying

MMMMM-------------------------CONDIMENTS------------------------------
           Chopped tomato
           Shredded lettuce (iceberg)
           Grated cheddar
           Chopped onion
           Sliced olives
           Sour cream
           Avacado or guacamole
           Salsa or taco sauce
 
  Let tortillas come to room temperature before attempting to use them.
  Use a well seasoned iron skillet for frying.
  
  Filling: Crumble hamburger into a skillet and add onion and garlic.
  Cook unitl meat is browned and onions are verging on translucent. Add
  mashed potatoes and stir in. Add garlic salt and pepper to taste.
  When all is hot and potatoes are well incorporated, turn burner to
  low and keep warm.
  
  To Fry: Heat skillet with oil about 1/16 to 1/8 inches deep. You will
  need to add more as you cook.  You should be able to cook at least
  two tacos at a time in an average size skillet. Just be sure to watch
  as they will burn quickly.  When a drop of water sizzles, begin to
  fry. Take a stack of tortillas and place a heaping spoonful of
  filling in the middle. Fold (like a taco :>) and place fold in hot
  oil to set. When it holds the shape lay on it's sde and fry one side.
  Use tongs to place in oil and to turn. When it is just crispy, turn
  to other side, and finish frying. Remove to plate covered with paper
  towels to soak up excess oil. While you are waiting for each batch to
  brown, spoon the filling for the next batch onto tortillas so you
  have them ready.
  
  Putting it all together: Add cheese first, then whatever more liquid
  ingredients you prefer (salsa, guacamole, etc)then the small chuncky
  ingredints and end with shredded lettuce (it sorta holds al the good
  stuff in).  Eat and enjoy. They are pretty messy, but it's worth it

  *Note: (I substitute half quick oats and half crisped rice)
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Grease the bottom of a 9x12 (9x13?)
  baking dish (glass works best).  In a large bowl, combine the first 5
  ingredients and stir well (it should be sort of a paste). Stir in
  remaining ingredients. You can add in whatever you want, so long as
  the mixture is sticking together in several large clumps. Press the
  mixture into the baking pan ( you can use your fingers -- it's not
  very sticky). Bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes (until it turns golden
  brown). Cool completely and cut into bars. Voila!

 Categories: Snacks, Biscuits, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 c  Melted margarine
    2/3 c  Peanut butter
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      3 c  Quick oats *
    1/2 c  Sunflower seeds
    1/2 c  Coconut
    1/3 c  Wheat germ
    1/2 c  Raisins
      1 c  Carob chips
           Other nuts/dried fruits
           -you want to add
 
  *Note: (I substitute half quick oats and half crisped rice)
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Grease the bottom of a 9x12 (9x13?)
  baking dish (glass works best).  In a large bowl, combine the first 5
  ingredients and stir well (it should be sort of a paste). Stir in
  remaining ingredients. You can add in whatever you want, so long as
  the mixture is sticking together in several large clumps. Press the
  mixture into the baking pan ( you can use your fingers -- it's not
  very sticky). Bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes (until it turns golden
  brown). Cool completely and cut into bars. Voila!

  medum heat, beat whipping cream, till stiff peaks form. With rubber
  spatula or wire whisk, fold whipped cream into almond custard. Evenly
  spoon custard into cooled Tart shell. Arrange grapes, cut side down
  and kiwifruit on tart in concentric circles. Carefully remove side
  from tart pan. In small saucepan over medium heat, melt apple jelly
  stirring occasionally. With pastry brush, carefully brush with melted
  jelly. Refrigerate tart till filling is completely set, about
        1    hour.

      Title: GRAPE BREAD (MUSTACEUS)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
    1/2 c  Lard, shortening, or butter
           Melted and cooled
    1/4 c  Feta cheese, crumbled and
           Mashed into a paste
      1 ts Cumin seed, ground
      1 ts Anise, ground
  1 1/2 c  Grape juice, purple or white
      1 pk Dry yeast
      8    Bay leaves
 
     1) Place the flour, lard, mashed cheese, ground cumin and anise,
  and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Blend well. Add the grape juice and
  mix the dough well for 2-3 minutes until all the grape juice is
  absorbed and evenly distributed.  The dough will be damp and sticky,
  but no internal dry areas should appear by the end of the mixing. If
  they do, mix a few minutes more or add a little more grape juice and
  mix again.
  
     2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsp. flour
  over the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured
  surface for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and
  only slightly sticky.  Add more flour if needed.  Let the dough rest
  2 minutes.
  
     3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30
  seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
  towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
  hours.
  
     4) Sprinkle top with flour, punch down, and form the dough into 4
  rectangular loaves (4 in. by 2 in. by 2-1/2 in.). Place two bay
  leaves on the bottom of each loaf, and lay them, leaf side down, on a
  greased cookie sheet.  Cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour,
  until well risen.
  
     5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until the
  loaves are brown on top and make a hollow sound when tapped on the
  bottom. Serve when cool. NOTE: To make these breads without
  leavening, omit the yeast, knead the dough thoroughly, then bake at
  350 degrees for about 2 hours. They will be chewy and moist, and very
  foreign to our taste. The Romans thought unleaven bread was manlier
  and much better for the digestion.

  quality for eating fresh or cooking.
  
  Procedure: Wash and stem grapes. Place grapes in a saucepan and add
  boiling water to cover grapes. Heat and simmer slowly until skin is
  soft. Strain through a damp jelly bag or double layers of
  cheesecloth. Refrigerate juice for 24 to 48 hours. Without mixing,
  carefully pour off clear liquid and save; discard sediment. If
  desired, strain through a paper coffee filter for a clearer juice.
  Add juice to a saucepan and sweeten to taste. Heat and stir until
  sugar is dissolved. Continue heating with occasional stirring until
  juice begins to boil. Fill into jars immediately, leaving 1/4-inch
  headspace. Adjust lids and process according to the recommendations

 Categories: Main dish, Eggs/cheese
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
      1    9-oz jar of grape leaves
    1/3 c  Dry couscous
      1 ts Ground cumin
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 sm Tomato, seeded and cut into
           -small dice
      2 tb Finely chopped parsley
      1 tb Olive oil, plus more for
           -sealing and grilling
           -stuffed grape leaves
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      2    7-oz logs goat cheese, cut
           -into 1/4-inch disks
 
  1. Rinse and separate grape leaves. Place in a large roasting pan and
  cover with boiling water. Let sit until water has cooled somewhat.
  Rinse in cold water and drain. Pat each leaf dry, clip off stem, and
  layer between paper towels. Set aside.
  
  2. In a small saucepan, combine couscous, 1/3 C boiling water, and
  cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and let stand until
  couscous is soft and fluffy when stirred with a fork, about 5 minutes.
  
  3. Transfer couscous to a medium bowl and add tomato, parsley, 1 T
  oil, and lemon juice. Toss together and add salt and pepper; the
  couscous should be slightly overseasoned.
  
  4. Lay out 10 grape leaves at a time on a clean work surface. Place a
  goat-cheese disk 1 inch from each stem end. Mound a heaping t of
  couscous over goat cheese. Fold stem end over filling, then fold
  sides of leaf over. Dab edges with olive oil to help seal. Fold top
  of leaf over folded sides and dab with oil again. Place on a plate,
  folded side down, layered between waxed paper. (Leaves can be
  prepared up to this point in advance and stored, refrigerated,
  overnight.)
  
  5. Heat grill or nonstick pan. Brush stuffed leaves with olive oil and
  place on grill or pan smooth side down. Grill or saute until browned,
  about 2 minutes. Turn carefully and continue cooking until cheese is
  soft and filling is heated through, about 2 minutes more. Serve
  immediately.

      Title: GRAPE NUT ROLL (SOUTZOUKI)
 Categories: Candies, Greek
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      6 oz Frozen grape juice;undiluted
    1/2 c  Sugar or honey
      1 sm Box pectin jell
           Citric acid (pea-sized);*OR*
      1    -Lemon, juice only, instead
    1/2 c  Whole walnuts
      3 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Cold water
 
  Candied nuts and grape juice, "soutzouki", is an ancient candy recipe
  still being used in the villages of Greece. The traditional recipe is
  quite involved, calling for the stringing of walnuts like beads on
  linen thread, boiling many pounds of grapes into a thick syrup and
  coating the nuts by pouring the thick syrup over them just as if you
  were making candies until a purple necklace is formed.  You can make
  this recipe in a simpler way without having to stamp on the grapes
  with bare feet.
  
      In a large deep pot bring juice and honey or sugar to a vigorous
  boil. Add pectin and boil 5 minutes. Dissolve citric acid first in a
  tablespoon of hot syrup, then add to the rest of the syrup, mixing it
  in. Add nuts. Dissolve cornstarch in cold water and mix into syrup,
  stirring quickly. Cook 1 minutes more.
      Ladle thick mixture on to heavy waxed paper.  Make a long thick
  roll. Pick up two sides of paper and press together to make a fat
  sausage of candy.  Let set at room temperature. Store in plastic bag.
  Slice as needed.

  directly into the bowl; add the remaining 1/2 cup of cereal, eggs,
  and vanilla. Stir with a heavy wooden spoon just until blended. Spoon
  the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top. Sprinkle with
  the remaining cereal. Bake until the loaf shrinks from the sides of
  the pan and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.  About 1
  hour. Loosely cover the top of the loaf with aluminum foil if it is
  getting too dark druing baking. Cool the loaf in the pan on a wire
  rack for 20 minutes. Carefully loosen around the sides of the pan,
  then invert onto the rack and turn right side up. Cool completely.
  Makes one loaf.

      Title: GRAPE STARTER
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Starter
 
MMMMM-----------------COOKING WITH MASTER CHEFS----------------------

MMMMM-------------------------FIRST DAY------------------------------
    1/2 lb Stemmed red grapes
      2 c  Bread flour
  2 1/2 c  Water

MMMMM------------------THREE DAYS BEFORE USING-----------------------
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Water

MMMMM-------------------TWO DAYS BEFORE USING------------------------
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Water

MMMMM--------------------ONE DAY BEFORE USING-------------------------
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Water
 
  It takes 10 days to complete but is then yours for life. Wrap the
  grapes in well washed cheesecloth, tieing the corners to form a bag;
  lightly crush them with a rolling pin (to release the sugar to mix
  with the natural yeast on the skins; just like making wine!) and
  immerse them in the flour water mix.  Cover tightly with a lid or
  plastic wrap secured with a rubber band. Leave at room temperature
  for 6 days, stirring once or twice a day for the six days.
  
  The bag of grapes will eventually appear inflated, and liquid will
  begin to separate from the flour base. The mixture will begin to
  taste and smell slightly fruity, and the color will be strange. That
  is as it should be. By the sixth day the bag of grapes will have
  deflated, the color will be yellow, and the taste pleasantly sour;
  the fermentation is complete. The starter is living but weak, and it
  needs to be fed.
  
  Remove the grapes and squeeze their juices back into the starter.
  Stir it up thouroughly and transfer it to a clean container.
  (Although you can use it after just one feeding, the starter will be
  stronger and healthier with the full treatment)  You can refrigerate
  it until you're ready to proceed.
  
  Three days before you plan to use it, stir 1 cup flour and 1 cup
  water into the container, blending well. Let stand uncovered at room
  temperature until it bubbles up - 3 to 4 hours - then cover and
  refrigerate. Repeat this for the second and third day.
  
  Store the starter tightly covered in the refrigerator where it will
  keep perfectly for 4 to 6 months.- after which it's a good idea to
  pour off all but 2 cups and give it another feeding. Before using the
  stored starter for bread, however, give it the full 3-day feeding
  schedule once again to restore it and to tone down excess sourness.
  
  Sylvia's comments: I bought a big bunch of black grapes for this
  (didn't remember that the recipe called for red grapes) and put them
  into 2 cheesecloth packages, which made cramming them into the
  container a bit difficult.  I wasn't sure how much to crush the
  grapes, so only used a little pressure with my hands, just enough to
  dampen the cheesecloth with grape juice. Later note: I should have
  crushed more, after 6 days the grapes were still pretty intact.  I
  squeezed everything I could out of one of my packets and threw it
  away, crushed the other more thoroughly and stuck in back in the
  starter.

    1/2 ts Almond extract
    1/4 ts Lemon zest;freshly grated

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
    3/4 c  Apricot preserves
      3 tb Sherry

MMMMM------------------------TO ASSEMBLE-----------------------------
    3/4 lb Grapes; preferably an
           -assortment of 2-3 colors,
           -halved & if necessary,
           -seeded
    1/4 c  Almonds, slivered; lightly
           -toasted
 
  "Take these to a picnic in the pans that they were baked in to prevent
  crushing. Assemble them not more than 6 hours before serving time.
  For a single 10 inch tarts, bake the crust for 15 minutes with foil
  in and a further 20 to 30 minutes empty."
  
  Finely grind almonds in a food processor with on/off motion, or crush
  with a rolling pin until as finely ground as possible. Add flour,
  salt and brown sugar to processor and blend, or combine ground
  almonds, flour, salt and brown sugar in a bowl and stir to blend. Add
  butter and process or work with the fingertips until mixture
  reassembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl beat egg lightly. Stir in
  the vanilla and lemon zest. With a processor on, add egg mixture to
  dough through feed tube and process until dough forms. Pat dough into
  ball, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for at least 30
  minutes. Remove dough from refrigerator and divide into 8 equal
  parts. Press each piece into a lightly buttered 3 to 3 1/2 inch
  tartlet pan, preferably with removable rim, patting into an even
  layer. (The dough will soften as you work with it.) Chill tartlet
  shells in freezer for at least 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven
  to 400F. remove tartlet shells from freezer, line each with a square
  of foil, and fill with pie weights or dried beans to prevent dough
  from puffing during baking. bake on baking sheet in center of oven
  for 10 minutes. remove foil with weights, reduce oven temperature to
  350F, and continue baking for 15 to 20 minutes, or until pastry is a
  rich, golden brown. Let tartlet shells cool in pans and place on wire
  racks to cool completely. To prevent glaze, combine preserves and
  sherry in a small saucepan and warm over medium heat, stirring, until
  preserves are melted. strain through a sieve. To assemble tarts,
  brush tarts on the bottom of each tartlet shell. arrange grapes, cut
  sides down, in a decorative pattern, alternating colors, in the
  bottom of each pastry shell. Brush remaining glaze, reheating it if
  necessary, over grapes and edges of tartlets. sprinkle toasted
  almonds over tartlets before glaze sets. Serve at room temperature.

      Title: GRAPEFRUIT & ORANGE SECTIONS
 Categories: Fruits, Canning
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 15 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
  quarts; an average of 13 pounds is needed per canner load of 9
  pints--an average of about 2 pounds yields 1 quart.
  
  Quality: Select firm, mature, sweet fruit of ideal quality for eating
  fresh. The flavor of orange sections is best if the sections are
  canned with equal parts of grapefruit. Grapefruit may be canned
  without oranges. Sections may be packed in your choice of water,
  citrus juice or syrup.
  
  Procedure: Wash and peel fruit and remove white tissue to prevent a
  bitter taste. If you use syrup, prepare a very light, light, or
  medium syrup and bring to boil. Fill jars with sections and water,
  juice or hot syrup, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and
  process.
  
  Processing directions for canning grapefruit and orange sections in a
  boiling-water, a dial, or a weighted-gauge canner are given in Table
  1, Table 2, and Table 3.

      Title: GRASMERE GINGERBREAD
 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 18 Servings
 
      1 lb Fine oatmeal
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      4 ts Ground ginger
      1 pn Allspice
    1/2 lb Pale muscovado sugar
    1/2 lb Butter
      2 tb Golden syrup
 
  Line a swiss roll or baking tin measuring about 9 x 13 inches with
  bakewell or greaseproof paper and grease it well. Stir the dry
  ingredients together. Melt the butter and syrup over low heat, pour
  on to the dry ingredients and stir well to make a fairly stiff
  mixture. Spread the mixture evenly over the base of the prepared tin
  and bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for 25-30 minutes.  Do not be
  alarmed by the fact that the mixture will look a little runny when it
  emerges from the oven; this is normal. Mark the biscuits into fingers
  or squares while still warm but leave in the tin until completely
  cold.  Don't make the biscuits very big ~ they are chewy and very
  filling. Good exercise for the jaws and high in calories. Source:

 Categories: Desserts, Beverages
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    9-in springform pan

MMMMM----------------CHOCOLATE COOKIE CRUMB CRUST---------------------
  1 1/2 c  Chocolate cookie crumbs
    1/4 c  Melted butter
    1/4 ts Cinnamon

MMMMM-----------------------CHEESE FILLING----------------------------
      1 lb Cream cheese
           -at room temperature
      1 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Green creme de menthe
      3 tb Creme de cacao
      2 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      6    Eggs; separated
      1 c  Sour cream
      2 oz Semisweet chocolate
           - grated to garnish
           -  the top of the cake
 
  CHOCOLATE COOKIE CRUMB CRUST: Combine chocolate cookie crumbs with
  melted butter and cinnamon. Toss and mix well. Press into the bottom
  and partially up the sides of the springform pan. Refrigerate and,
  while making the filling, preheat the oven to 325F.
  
  CHEESE FILLING: Put the cream cheese in a mixing bowl and beat until
  light and soft. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar and mix well. Stir in the
  creme de menthe and the creme de cacao, flour and salt. Beat until
  the mixture is blended well. Add the egg yolks and sour cream, and
  beat until the batter is smooth and blended. Combine the egg whites
  and 1/4 cup remaining sugar and beat until the whites stand in soft
  peaks. Fold the beaten whites into the cream-cheese mixture. Pour the
  batter into the crust and bake for about 1 hour, or until the cake
  has puffed and trembles just slightly when shaken. A wooden skewer
  inserted in the cake should come out almost clean, with just a trace
  of batter or moist crumbs on it. Don't overbake; it will settle and
  firm somewhat as it cools. Don't worry if the cake cracks as it
  bakes. Remove and cool. Refrigerate if standing more than 4 hours.
  Garnish the top with grated chocolate.

 Categories: Side dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    450 g  Potatoes
           - peeled & coarsely grated
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 sm Onion; grated
      1 tb Cornflour
           Salt and pepper
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
           Ground-nut oil for frying
 
  Serves 2-3
  
  These are gorgeous. There is something very special about the taste of
  grated raw potato lightly cooked, and these patties are distinctly
  moreish. You probably won't have any leftovers!
  
  Soak the grated potatoes in cold water. Drain them through a large
  sieve, pressing out all the water, then pat them dry with kitchen
  paper.
  
  Mix the beaten egg, onion and cornflour together and season with salt,
  pepper and nutmeg. Stir in the grated potato.
  
  In a small, heavy-bottomed frying-pan heat a little oil until it is
  hot, then drop the mixture 2-3 tbs at a time into the pan, and
  flatten each pancake with the back of a spoon. Cook on both sides
  until golden. Drain on kitchen paper and keep hot in a low oven until
  ready to eat.

 Categories: Breads, Potatoes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 c  White flour
      1 md Grated potato
      1 ts Salt
 
  Mix the 1 cup warm water, 1-1/2 cups white flour and 1 tsp. each salt
  and sugar in a 2-cup measure.  Add enough grated potato to make 2
  cups. Place in a wide mouth glass jar or small mixing bowl (do not
  use metal or plastic) which will hold about 1 quart. Cover with a
  single thickness of cheesecloth to allow wild yeast from the air to
  settle into it for 24 hours.  Stir well, cover tightly with a
  clinging transparent wrap which will cause the moisture to drip back
  and keep top of mixture from drying. Stir several times a day. In two
  or three days it will become foamy and very light. (The length of
  time depends on temperature. 80 ~85 is ideal. It can go a little
  below 80 without harm, only slowing the procedure a little, but if it
  goes much higher than 85 it will be spoiled.) Then stir well, pour
  into glass jar with screw-top lid and store in refrigerator at about
  38 degrees.  As soon as 1/2 inch of clear liquid has risen to the top
  it has ripened enough to start using. Do not be concerened if the
  mixture turns dark because of the raw potato during the fermentation
  period. It does not affect the bread made from it in any way and as
  soon as the starter is mature, it will become a snowy white. To renew
  starter: Add 1-1/2 cups white flour and 1-1/2 cups water each time it
  is used so that there are always 2 cups to bake with and 2 full cups
  to return to refrigerator.  If for some reason it cannot be used
  regularly about twice a week, add 1 tsp. sugar and stirr well every
  three or four days.

  pine nuts and cook them until they are lightly browned. Add the bread
  crumbs. Saute the mixture for a few minutes, then season with a pinch
  of salt and pepper. Add the oregano and parsley. Drain the eggplant
  slices and dry well on paper towels. In a large skillet heat 4 T of
  olive oil. Saute the eggplant slices, adding more oil as you need it,
  until they are nicely browned. In an oval baking dish make a layer of
  eggplant. Top with a layer of peppers. Sprinkle with a few capers and
  repeat the layers.  Top with bread-crumb mixture. Make a lacing of
  anchovies and optional pimiento strips with the black olives in

      Title: GRATIN OF WALLEYE
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Walleye fillets
      2 tb Parsley, minced
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Capers (W/juice)
      2    Green peppers
      5 tb Cooking oil
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped fine
    1/2 ts Powdered thyme
 
  Roasted peppers lend a wonderful flavor to fish dishes. Prepare this
  dish in a shallow baking dish or baked in individual gratin dishes if
  available. Wash and pat the fillets dry, then dice into 1-inch
  squares. Season with salt and pepper.
    Wash, then dry the green peppers and roast them under the broiler,
  turning them as the skin blackens. Place the peppers in a paper bag,
  seal by twisting the top, and set aside for 5 minutes or so. Then
  remove and, with finger, push and pinch off most of the blackened
  skin. Cut in half, remove the seeds and stems and slice into thin
  strips.
    Put the oil in a big skillet and saute the garlic until it is
  translucent.  Then scrape in the fillet squares from your cutting
  board, turn up the heat, and cook, stirring constantly for about 5
  minutes.
    Off heat, add and mix thoroughly the peppers, parsley, capers, and
  half the bread crumbs into which you have mixed the thyme. Spoon into
  baking dish and sprinkle the rest of the crumb-thyme mixture over
  all, and place under the broiler for a minute or two to brown. Serve
  with tossed salad and baked potatoes.

MMMMM---------------------ENGLISH RECIPE II--------------------------
    2/3 c  Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
     20    Peppercorns, white

MMMMM-----------------------MAITRE'D SAUCE----------------------------
      3 tb Mustard, dark,
           -French, coarse-ground
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 pn White pepper, ground
      1 tb Vinegar
      6 tb Olive oil
      6 tb Dill
 
  Get a whole fish, clean it and remove the head.  Split into two
  filets, removing the backbone but leave the skin on. Dry off the
  filets and remove all the little bones.
  
  Crush the peppers and seasonings in a mortar, add the salt and sugar.
  Mix well and press the mixture into the filets.
  
  In a glass or ceramic dish, put some dill on the bottom, then one of
  the filets, skin side down, then more dill, then the other filet,
  skin side up. Put the thick side of one filet against the other's
  thin side. Cover with plastic wrap (NOT ALUMINUM FOIL) and put a
  cutting board or similar on top with some weight on it (e.g. a couple
  of beer cans).
  
  Put it in the refrigerator for a day or so.  (Thin filets are ready
  in 1 day, thicker in 2 days.) Turn the filet over once or twice
  during this time. Pour off the brine, otherwise the fish will be too
  salty. The fish will keep for a week in a refrigerator after pouring
  off the brine.
  
  Make the sauce, Maitre'd sauce.  Mix together the mustard, sugar,
  salt, pepper and vinegar. Add the oil drop by drop as if making a
  mayonnaise. Add the dill. Let the sauce sit for about 10 minutes.
  
  Cut off either thin (nearly horizontal) slices, or thick vertical
  slices, to taste. (Don't cut through the skin). Serve as an appetizer
  on thin slices of buttered rye bread (with a little lemon juice and
  some finely chopped dill), or as a main dish with boiled new potatoes
  and Maitre'd sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Swedish dill-cured salmon -- Gravlax uses a salt-sugar mixture to
  cure the fish. The fish is flavored by dill and whatever else is
  handy. (I've used gin, Julia Child has used cognac).
  
  I've gathered these versions of the recipe from several sources. From
  "Ver Cokbok" (the Swedish equivalent of "Joy of Cooking" or "Mrs.
  Beeton.") From a brochure published by the Swedish Information
  Service. From a booklet written by Tore Wretman, who owned a major
  restaurant and has published several cookbooks of his own. Gravlax is
  like barbecue, a process that you follow, but can vary considerably.
  
  Don't skimp on the salt.  The proportion of salt to fish is important
  to preserve the fish.  Here are several variations on a single basic
  recipe. Yield: Serves 3-4.
  
  *  You can broil or grill thick slices of gravlax. After you've eaten
  the salmon, you can also cut the skin in thin strips, sear them
  briefly on the skin side, and serve them as a garnish.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy once the fish is prepared.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, several days aging.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: GRAVLAX (SALMON MARINATED IN DILL)
 Categories: Swedish, Seafood, Appetizers, Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Fresh salmon fillet; center
           -cut, cleaned & scaled
      1 lg Bunch Dill; fresh, whole
    1/4 c  Kosher salt (coarse, or
           -regular is necessary)
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb White peppercorns (or black)
           -crushed
 
  Cut the salmon in half lengthwise and remove the backbone and the
  small, freebones, as well, or ask your fish delaer to do it for you.
  Leave the skin on. Place half of the fish, skin side down, in a deep
  glass, enamel or stainless steel baking dish or casserle. Wash and
  then shake dry the bunch of dill and place it on the fish. (If the
  fill is of the hothouse variety and not very pungent, chop the herb
  coarsely to release it's flavor and sprinkle it over the fish
  instead.) In a separate bowl, combine the salt, sugar and crushed
  peppercorns. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the dill. Top with the
  other half of the fish, skin side up. Cover with foil and set a heavy
  plate or platter on top of it, slightly larger than the salmon. Weigh
  it down with cans or jars and refrigerate for at least 3 days, up to
  7 days. Turn the fish over every 12 hours or so, basting with the
  liquid marinade that accumulates, separating the halves a little to
  baste the salmon inside. Replace the platter and weights each time.
  When the gravlax is finished, remove the fish from it's marinade and
  scrape away the dill and seasonings. Pat dry with paper towels. Or
  leave the dill and seasonings in place. Place the separated halves
  skin side down on a carving board and slice the salmon thinly on the
  diagonal, detaching each slice from the skin. Gravlax is served as
  part of a smorgasbord or as an appetizer and is usually accompanied
  by a mustard-dill sauce (see recipe). When gravlax is presented as a
  main course, it is garnished with lemon wedges as well as the
  mustard-dill sauce and served with toast and perhaps a cucumber salad.

  .\\ichele's Notes: This is one of the easiest recipes to make. Long
  as you start it in advance it's basically a no-brainer. Just remember
  to turn and baste every 12 hours. And slice thin. Mmmmmmm, its great!

      Title: GREAT GLUTEN TURKEY
 Categories: Vegetarian, Holiday
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/2    Yard, cheesecloth
      2 tb Poultry flavoring mix
  1 1/2 c  ;water
      1 tb Soy margarine or oil
      2 tb White wine or gluten stock
      2    Sheets,bean curd sheet--
           -aka yuba
      2 c  Dressing of choice

MMMMM---------------------------GLUTEN--------------------------------
      5 oz (fl) Vital wheat guluten flr
      1 oz (fl) whole wheat pastry flor
      1 tb Poultry flavoring mix
      5 oz ;water
 
  Mix the flours, water and flavor mix. Dough should be firm, add more
  flour if it is not. Roll the gluten out into a rectangle, place on
  the spread-out cheesecloth and loosely fold edges over it to meet in
  the middle (this is to keep it from getting glued to itself during
  cooking). Then roll it up lengthwise (loosely to allow for expansion).
  
  Tie the ends and and around the middle with string. Make sure you
  allow for expansion to 2-3 times its original size.
  
  Place this in a pot with the water and seasoning and bring to a boil,
  then lower to simmering for 1 1/2 hours. Turn at least once during
  cooking. This can be done two days in advance.
  
  Prepare your dressing and remove the gluten from the stock (which
  will be used for gravy). Unroll the gluten and fill with the dressing
  or mound the dressing on the baking pan and tuck the gluten around it.
  
  Reconstitute the bean curd sheets by soaking for 5 minutes in hot
  water. They'll turn white and pliable but will be fragile. Cover the
  cooked gluten roll with 2 or 3 layers of this. Brush the "turkey"
  with the oil or melted soy margarine between layers and on top. Mix
  the wine or stock with the remaining oil ormargarine and use this to
  baste thile baking. Two T seasoning mix may be added to the stock for
  more flavor.
  
  Place in a pre-heated 350 degree oven and bake for 45 min to 1 hour,
  basting every 15 minutes. If it begins to brown toomuch, cover
  loosely with aluminum foil.
  
  Carve and serve with stuffing.

      Title: GREAT GRANDMA SILVA'S CHILEAN EMPANADAS
 Categories: Empanadas
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Round steak or boneless rump
           Roast
      1    Garlic clove
      1    Onion stuck with 3 cloves
      1    Carrot, peeled, cut into
           Pieces
    1/2 c  Sherry
  1 1/2 c  Black raisins
      3 tb Olive oil
      1    Onion, minced
      3 ts Oregano
      3 ts Cumin seed, crushed
      2 tb Ground chile (California or
           New Mexican chile
           Powder)
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Slivered almonds
      1 c  Sliced black olives, or 1/2
        c  Sliced stuffed green olives
           Grandma's favorite)
      2 tb Sugar for sprinkling over
           Empanadas (optional)
 
  PASTRY:
  
  1/4 cup vegetable shortening 2 tablespoons butter 3 cups all-purpose
  flour 1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon water 1 teaspoon salt 2 1/2 cups canola
  oil for frying Cut meat into 6 pieces, place in a heavy pot and cover
  with cold water. Add garlic, whole onion and carrot. Simmer gently
  for 2 hours. If the meat cooks over high heat, it will toughen. When
  the meat is tender, turn off heat and let it cool in the broth until
  warm to the touch. Reserve broth.
  
  Using a sharp knife, chop meat very finely. You also can use a food
  processor but don't overdo. Grandma always minced her meat in a small
  wooden bowl using a hand chopper with a curved blade, but my
  ethnicity goes only so far...
  
  Warm the sherry in a small saucepan; add the raisins and let steep
  while you prep the other ingredients.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet; add the onion and saute until
  softened. Stir in the oregano and crushed cumin and saute for 1
  minute. Stir in the chopped beef, ground chile and salt. Cook for 15
  minutes, adding enough of the reserved broth to make the mixture
  glisten. It should not be soggy, just moist.
  
  Remove picadillo from the heat, and stir in the plumped raisins, the
  almonds and olives. Taste, and add more salt, orega- no, cumin or
  chile powder, if desired. If the picadillo seems a bit drier than you
  like, add more broth or (better yet) some of the raisin sherry.
  Refrigerate overnight, or up to 3 days.
  
  The pastry: Using a large fork or pastry blender, cut the shortening
  and butter into the flour until crumbly. Stir the salt into the
  water. Drizzle water slowly over the flour mixture, adding just
  enough to make a soft pliable dough. Knead gently a floured board for
  1 minute. The dough should be smooth but not overworked. Break off a
  golf ball-size piece of dough (keeping the remaining dough covered
  with plastic wrap) and roll into a 6- inch circle. Place 1/2 cup
  picadillo on half of the circle. Fold over the top half, pinching
  over the edges; press with a fork to seal. It is important to seal
  the edges well so the filling doesn't leak out during frying.
  
  Heat the canola oil in a 2-inch deep skillet. When the oil is hot
  enough it will ripple. Ease in 1 empanada and spoon hot oil over the
  surface. After 1 1/2 minutes, turn the empanada. Total cooking time
  for each empanada is about 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove
  and drain on several thicknesses.of paper towel, blotting the surface
  with more paper towels. Sprinkle empanadas lightly with sugar while
  still warm.
  
  If you plan to serve the empanadas later, cool, cover, and
  refrigerate. To reheat, place on a cookie sheet and bake in a 350
  degree F. oven for 10 minutes. Makes about 12 very large empanadas,
  or 24 small turnovers.

      Title: GREAT GRAPE CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Chicken breasts, halved,
           -boned, skinned (6 halves,
           -about 3 lb in all)
      2 tb Butter (or margarine)
      1 tb Orange marmalade (I suggest
           -fresh coarsely-grated
           -orange peel)
    1/4 ts Tarragon, crumbled
    1/3 c  White wine, dry
      1    Green onion,
           -thinly sliced (use
           -part of the top)
      1 c  Grapes, seedless
           -(try red grapes,
           -such as "Flame")
    1/4 c  Cream, whipping
           Salt
           Nutmeg
 
  Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and nutmeg.  Brown lightly in
  heated butter in a large frying pan. Add marmalade, tarragon, green
  onion and wine. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Add grapes, cover again and continue cooking about 10 minutes longer,
  until chicken is cooked through (test with a small, sharp knife in
  thickest part).
  
  Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken and grapes to a warm serving
  dish; keep warm. Add cream to liquid in pan. Bring to boiling,
  stirring, and cook until reduced and slightly thickened. Salt to
  taste. Pour sauce over chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken in wine with grapes and orange -- This recipe was
  originally posted by Wayne Thompson. I thought it was great, and I
  submit it here with some variations. This colors in this dish are a
  feast for the eyes. The recipe comes originally from "Elegant Meals
  with Inexpensive Meats," by Ortho Books. Yield: Serves 4 to 6.
  
  *  (WT) I use a whole cut up chicken.
  
  *  (CSR) I like to cook the chicken in a black cast-iron pan; I skip
  the cream sauce, because it smothers the beautiful
  black-green-red-orange-tan colors.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  Peel large shrimp and marinate, for 1 hour, in olive oil, garlic,

  pan-fry. I use an Electric Wok at 350 degrees, I use lots of garlic,
  and I use Garlic salt in- stead of regular salt. I add cooked
  linguine or pasta (al dente), toss well to  coat the pasta and
  sprinkle with a little more parsley and serve. It's fast and very
  easy and really delicious. Please let me know if you try it and if

    1/2 ts Vanilla

  CHILL DOUGH SEVERAL HOURS OR OVERNIGHT: Could put the dough in the
  freezer to chill, if in a hurry, for 1-2 hours. Heat oven to 300
  degrees. Grease cookie sheet (only ONCE). No need to grease it each
  time.
    Add ingredients together, saving out the 1/4 cup of flour. Knead
  the 1/4 cup flour into the dough now, chill. Roll out, using flour on
  surface, cutters and rolling pin, generously. Try to get more flour
  on tiny places.
     This is a great recipe for the creased cookie cutters, because it
  is delicious and dough does not lose its shape. For this type of
  cutter, roll to about 1/4" thickness, so dough is just thick enough
  to leave the cutter imprints. Ordinarily, roll dough to 1/4"
  thickness for best results. Any cookie will lose detail and shape
  when it is too thick. This cookie is good iced with thin royal icing.
  Cookie stays soft, but is not terribly fragile. Source: Shared with
  me by Mary Billersen of Cin. because I helped her replace some

  in bottom of each sprayed cup, reserving remaining layers. Arrange
  1/10 of cheese mixture over each biscuit in cup, then top each with
  remaining biscuit layer; press around edge of each biscuit to seal.
  Partially fill remaining cups with water (this will prevent pan from

  10 minutes.
  
  Remove pan from oven and carefully drain off water. Remove biscuits
  to wire rack and let cool. Makes 5 servings

  Spaghetti according to package directions; drain. In Dutch oven or
  large skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add chicken
  mixture and red pepper. Stir-fry just until chicken is slightly pink.
  Add yellow squash and zucchini. Cook until hot. In small bowl, blend
  water, cornstarch, bouillon and salt. Add to chicken mixture. Cook,
  stirring constantly, until thickened and translucent.  Add hot
  spaghetti; toss to mix. Heat through. Arrange on wa rm serving
  platter. Serve immediately. Refrigerate leftovers.
  
  NOTES:  This is excellent but the amount of chicken needs to be
  doubled as well as the marinade ingredients or else the pasta amount
  cut in half. It is also excellent cold served as a pasta salad. This
  might be good with rotelle pasta as well.

      Title: GREEK CHICKEN [TRIMMED]
 Categories: Poultry, Taverna, Dinner
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
        5 lb roasting chicken, skinless
        1    lemon -- quartered
      1/4 c  olive oil
  :          salt and pepper
       12    cloves garlic -- crushed
        2 ts dried oregano -- plus
        3 TB dried oregano
      1/3 c  fresh lemon juice
        2 ts cracked black pepper
        6    boiling potatoes -- wedged
  :          and chunked
        1 c  water -- or
      1/2 c  lowfat chicken broth -- as
  :          needed
      1/4 c  flatleaf parsley -- chopped
  
  Consider placing sliced root vegetables (carrots, turnips) and onions
  in the bottom of the pan that will take the place of a rack and add
  flavors. Roasting at two oven temperatures gives chicken a crispy
  outside, and a moist inside. Heat oven to 400 degrees. * Rinse
  chicken and pat dry. Rub chicken inside and out with cut lemon
  quarters, 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and
  ground pepper. Place the lemon quarters,4 garlic gloves and 2
  teaspoons oregano in the chicken cavity. Place chicken on rack in a
  roasting pan. * In a small saucepan, combine remaining olive oil,
  lemon juice, 2 tablespoons oregano, coarsely cracked pepper and 1
  teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer3
  minutes. Remove from heat. * Place potatoes and the remaining 8
  garlic cloves around the chicken and sprinkle them with remaining 1
  tablespoon oregano. Spoon a little of the lemon-oil mixture over the
  chicken. Pour 1 cup water or broth evenly over potatoes and place in
  oven. Roast 15 minutes. Baste chicken with some of the lemon-oil
  mixture and reduce heat to 350 degrees. Roast, basting with lemon-oil
  mixture every 10-15 minutes, until juices run clear when thigh is
  pierced with a fork or an instant-read thermometer inserted in the
  thigh, not touching bone, reads 180 degrees, about 1 1/4 hours. *
  Transfer chicken to a warmed platter. If potatoes aren't golden,
  raise heat to 450 degrees and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, adding more
  water or broth if necessary to prevent sticking. Garnish with
  parsley. Recipe from Taverna: Best of Casual Mediterranean Cooking by

      Title: GREEK GREEN BEANS (SKETA FASSOULA)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Green beans (thin,tender
           -ones are best)
      1 md Yellow onion, chopped finely
           Olive Oil
      4 md Tomatoes
           Salt and Pepper
 
  Wash and string the beans, but leave them whole.  In a large, deep
  skillet, heat about 3-4 T. of olive oil until hot. Add the onion and
  saute for about 5 minutes until it is tender, but not brown. Add the
  green beans. Cover the skillet (if you don't have a lid use a cookie
  sheet--I do!). Cook for about 15 minutes or until the beans start to
  wilt. Coarsely chop two of the tomatoes (ONLY TWO).  Add to the pan
  and cover again. Cook for another 15-20 minutes until the tomatoes
  have melted into a sauce. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. If
  necessary add another one or two chopped tomatoes and continue
  cooking. You may need to add extra olive oil also as it contributes
  to the flavor. Cook until the beans are very tender. Trust me,
  crunchy does NOT work with this dish. Serve hot, cold, or at room
  temperature (the way Greeks do--at least my Greek family does!). If
  you can find good, creamy feta, crumble a good chunk into the beans
  before serving. Elizabeth (Lisa) Wooll ewooll@ctp.org

      Title: GREEK GYRO
 Categories: Greek, Harned 1994, Sandwiches, Veal, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Lean, boneless lamb*
           -- cut in 1" cubes
    1/3 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- peeled, cut in quarters
      1 ts Chopped fresh thyme
      1 ts Chopped fresh oregano or
      1 ts Chopped fresh marjoram
           Fresh ground pepper to taste
      2    Spanish onions; cut in
           -thinly sliced rings
     24 sm Romaine lettuce leaves
           -- washed and dried
      6 lg Pita bread rounds
      3 md Ripe tomatoes

MMMMM--------------------GARLIC YOGURT SAUCE-------------------------
      2 c  Plain yogurt
      1    Garlic clove
           -- peeled and minced
      1 ts Chopped fresh oregano or
      1 ts Chopped fresh marjoram
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 ts Olive oil
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  *Use meat cut from the leg or shoulder.
  
  The morning before an afternoon barbecue, make marinade by combining
  oil, lemon juice, garlic cloves, herbs and pepper in a medium bowl.
  Remove about 1/4 cup to mix with the onions. Place lamb cubes in bowl
  with remaining marinade; toss to coat well.
  
  Place onions in small bowl and toss with reserved marinade. Cover with
  plastic wrap and chill, up to several hours, turning several times.
  
  Meanwhile, make yogurt sauce by lining a medium bowl with cheesecloth
  and spooning in the yogurt.  Tie up edges of cheesecloth with string
  to form a pouch. Suspend over bowl (tying from refrigerator rack
  above bowl), or place in a colander over bowl and let stand to drain
  several hours. Moisture will drip from the yogurt, giving it a
  thicker consistency. Mix drained yogurt with minced garlic, chopped
  herbs, lemon juice, oil, salt and pepper.  Cover and chill.  Makes
  about 1 cup.
  
  Stack pita bread rounds into 2 piles and wrap each in foil, dull side
  out.
  
  To barbecue, heat coals or gas barbecue.  Remove meat from marinade,
  reserving some marinade for basting. (Discard any large garlic
  pieces.) Thread lamb onto greased skewers and grill over greased
  grill about 4" from hot coals.  Cook, turning and basting often,
  about 10 minutes or until lamb is brown on the outside, still pink
  inside. Warm pita rounds over barbecue.
  
  Before serving, lift the onions from the marinade with a slotted
  spoon and place in a serving bowl.  Cut whole tomatoes into thin
  wedges and place on plate. Place lettuce leaves on plate. Set out
  yogurt sauce and lots of napkins to facilitate handling of gyros.
  
  To serve, cut each warmed pita bread in half and separate to form 2
  pockets.  Each person fills a warmed pita picket with some of the
  grilled lamb cubes, lettuce, tomatoes and onions, topping with a
  spoonful of sauce.
  
  Yield: 12 gyros, 2 per person.

 Categories: Lamb, Meats, Greek, Wine
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 md Onions
      3    Green bell peppers
      4    To 5 lb leg of lamb; boned
           -and cubed
      1 ts Dried oregano; crumbled
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      3    Bay leaves
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      3    Garlic cloves; minced
           Juice of 2 lemons
      1 c  Dry white wine
      1 ts ;salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
      6    Tomatoes; quartered
 
  Cut onions into quarters and separate layers.  Cut peppers into
  quarters, and cut each quarter in half. Combine all ingredients,
  except tomatoes, in a shallow roasting pan, mixing well so that meat
  is completely coated. Marinate in refrigerator for several hours.
  Take out of refrigerator and let sit out about 20 minutes to come to
  room temperature. Before cooking, add tomatoes to marinade and mix
  well to coat with juices. Place meat cubes on skewers, alternating
  with green pepper slices, onion slices, and tomato wedges. Lay
  skewers in pan with marinade, turning several times. Put skewered
  lamb on a rack over pan containing marinade and place under preheated
  broiler. Turn several times during cooking and baste with marinade
  from pan.  Cooking time depends on your taste; for medium rare allow
  about 15-18 minutes. Serve skewers on plates with rice pilaf.
  
  Alternatively you can barbecue lamb using marinade as the basting
  sauce. This is always the way we cook this dish--rain or shine. Check
  doneness of lamb at about 10 minutes and if not done to your liking,
  cook further until cooked through.

           Chicken or beef stock
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
 
  Cooked rice Minced parsley
  
  Put meat into a bowl with onion, garlic, uncooked rice, herbs, salt
  and pepper.  Beat two of the egg whites until they froth and add them
  as well.
  
  Reserve yolks and the other egg for the sauce.  Gently mix with a
  fork or your hands, and form walnut-size balls. Fry meatballs in
  vegetable oil over low heat. When lightly brown, remove with a
  slotted spoon to a saucepan. Add enough stock to cover meatballs, and
  simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes.
  
  Pour off stock through a sieve, and measure it.  You will need 1 1/2
  cups for the sauce. To make the sauce, beat reserved egg yolks and
  the whole egg together until quite frothy. Whisk in lemon juice bit
  by bit, then whisk in hot stock bit by bit, beating steadily. Pour
  over meatballs, and cook, stirring, over low heat until sauce
  thickens. Do not let it come to a boil, or it will separate. Serve on
  a bed of rice, sprinkled with parsley.
  
  Makes four servings.

  baking pan. Layer the pan with 12 individual sheets of filo,
  buttering each with pastry brush as they are placed. Be careful to
  cover the remaining sheets of filo with a slighlty damp twoel to
  avoid drying them out. Wet the walnut mixture with a small amount of
  butter and mix thoroughly. apply a layer of one-half of this mixture
  into the pan. Next apply five more layers of filo as before, on top
  of this. Layer next with remaining walnut mixture. Apply layers of
  filo dough on top of this until all is used. Chill for one-half hour.
  Cut rows of pastry length-wise and then cut diagonally to make
  diamond shapes. Pour remaining butter evenly over top. Pre-heat oven
  to 350 degrees F. and bake until golden brown (45min to 1 hour)  Pour
  cooled syrup over the hot baklava until all is absorbed. Important:

  stirring constantly until mixture thickens. When thick, add parmesan
  and crumbled feta cheese and stir until melted.  A few tablespoons of

  After the eggs are stirred in, pour this mixture over the meat and
  pasta. Bake about 45 min or until brown.
  
    This dish is a bit like moussaka because of the topping.
  
  NOTE: 6/12/93 - Made this dish with Montery Jack cheese instead of

   Open package of dough and cut a strip 2" wide, cutting through all
  layers. Cover remaining dough with a damp cloth to keep from cracking.
   Separate dough so that you have 2 sheets for each triangle. Brush the
  dough with melted butter and put 1 rounded teaspoon spinach mixture
  at the top of the strip. Fold pastry over like folding a flag. Place
  on well-buttered baking sheet and brush top with butter. Bake at 375
  deg. for 20 min. Serve warm.
   To freeze the triangles before cooking, butter both sides of
  triangle and wrap well. Bake when needed.

      3 md Eggplants
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      3 lg Onions; chopped fine
      2 lb Ground lamb; (or beef)
      3 tb Tomato paste
    1/2 c  Red wine
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
    1/4 lb Butter
      6 tb Flour
      1 qt Milk
      4    Eggs; beaten until frothy
           Grated nutmeg
      2 c  Ricotta or cottage cheese
      1 c  Fine bread crumbs
      1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Peel the eggplants and cut them into slices about 1/2 inch thick.
  Brown the slices quickly in 1/4 cup of the oil. Set aside. Heat the
  remaining oil in the same skillet and cook the onions until they are
  brown. Add the ground meat and cook 10 minutes. Pour off excess fat.
  Combine the tomato paste with the wine, parsley, cinnamon, salt and
  peper. Stir this mixture into the meat and simmer over low heat,
  stirring frequently, until all the liquid has been absorbed. Remove
  the mixture from the fire. Preheat the oven to 375F. Make a white
  sauce by melting the butter and blending in the flour, stirring with
  a wire whisk. Meanwhile, bring the milk to a boil and add it
  gradually to the butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly. When the
  mixture is thickened and smooth, remove it from the heat. Cook
  slightly and stir in the beaten eggs, nutmeg and ricotta. Grease an
  11x16-inch pan and sprinkle the bottom lightly with crumbs. Arrange
  alternate layers of the eggplant and the meat sauce in the pan,
  sprinkling each layer with Parmesan and crumbs. Pour the ricotta
  sauce over the top and bake 1 hour, or until top is golden. Remove
  from the oven and cool 20 to 30 minutes before serving. Cut into
  squares and serve. The flavors in this dish really improve if you
  make it a day ahead.

  the oil in a heavy saucepan, stir in the onions, and cook gently until
  transparent.  Add the garlic, tomatoes, sugar, wine, salt and pepper,

      Title: GREEK TSOUREKI ( EASTER BREAD)
 Categories: Greek, Breads, Holiday
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Sweet butter
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2    Eggs; beaten
      5 tb Orange juice
      1 tb Grated orange rind
  5 1/2 c  Sifted flour
           Butter; melted
           Red-dyed, hard-boiled eggs
    1/4 c  Slivered almonds
      2 tb Granulated sugar
 
  In a small saucepan, combine the milk and butter over medium heat and
  scald.  Stir until the butter melts, then pour into a mixing bowl.
  When lukewarm, sprinkle in the yeast, and with fingers or a heavy
  spoon gradually stir in the 1/2 cup sugar until it dissolves. Then
  add the salt, eggs 3 tablespoons of the orange juice, and the orange
  rind, stirring continuously, and gradually add half the flour until
  the mixture begins to bubble.  Continue adding flour gradually by
  hand; the dough will be sticky, but should not be stiff. Flour your
  fingers lightly and knead for 15 minutes.  Place the dough in a large
  buttered bowl, brush the dough with melted butter, cover, and place
  in a warm area to rise until doubled in bulk (approximately 2 to 3
  hours).
     Punch the dough down and divide into 2 parts. Divide each half
  into 3 parts and roll each into a long rope about 10" x 2". Braid the
  three ropes together; pinch to seal the ends if leaving long, or join
  together to form a long round loaf (see note below). Repeat with the
  other half of the dough to make a second tsoureki. Place in large
  baking pans or on a cookie sheet, cover, and let rise until doubled
  in bulk (approx. 1 1/2 hours).
     Meanwhile, prepare the glaze by mixing the remaining orange juice,
  remaining sugar, and the almonds in a small bowl. Bake the tsourekia
  in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and with a
  pastry brush glaze the tops and sides of loaves. Return to the oven
  and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until the color is a rich and
  shiny chestnut.
     Note:  If using the Easter eggs, tuck them into the center when you
  shape the loaves, leave until loaves have doubled and bake them with
  the loaf.  After baking, though lovely, the eggs will be inedible.
  Also in some provinces, the tsoureki is formed with a large braid and
  a smaller one over it, making a much larger loaf requiring a longer
  baking time.

      Title: GREEK VEGETABLE CASSEROLE
 Categories: Vegetables, Casseroles
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Eggplant
      2 lb Zucchini
      4 md Potatoes
      2    Green peppers
      1    Red pepper
      2 md Onions
      1 c  Olive oil
      4 md Tomatoes
      2    Garlic cloves
      1 ts Sugar
           Salt & pepper; to taste
 
  (1)  Prepare the vegetables: Cut the eggplant, zucchini and potatoes
     in  bite sized chunks (do not peel the zucchini or the eggplant).
     Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers and slice them into
     strips. Peel and slice the onions. Dice the tomatoes.
  
  (2)  Saute' the vegetables except the tomatoes  in the olive oil in
     small  batches.  Saut' each batch for 2 or 3 minutes, then remove
     from the pan, trying to drain some of the oil so that enough oil
     is  left  for the next batch. When you're done, most (if not all)
     of the oil should be gone from the pan.
  
  (3)  Place the saute'ed vegetables in a  baking  dish and toss them
     briefly  so  that you won't get only one kind of vegetable in one
     place.
  
  (4)  Add the tomatoes into the pan and saut' for a couple of minutes.
     Crush the garlic and add to the tomatoes. Add the sugar, salt and
     pepper to taste and simmer for another minute.
  
  (5)  Pour the tomato sauce on top of the vegetables and bake at 350
     deg. F or until the vegetables are tender.
  
  (6)  Serve with plenty of fresh bread and,  if  you like, some feta
     cheese on the side.
  
  RATING Difficulty: easy. Time: 30-45 minutes preparation, 1 hour
  baking. Precision: No need to measure.

 Categories: Canadian li, Herbs, Potatoes, Rice, Grains & be
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Olive oil
      4    Green onions, sliced
      1    Clove garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
      2 c  Black-eyed peas (19 oz.can),
           -drained and rinsed
    1/4 ts Grated lemon rind
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 pn Salt
      2 tb Crumbled feta cheese,
           -optional
 
  In skillet, heat oil over medium heat; cook onions, garlic and
  oregano for 2 minutes or until softened. Add 2 tablespoons water,
  beans, lemon rind, juice, pepper and salt. Cover and cook for 1
  minute until hot. (Beans can be refrigerated up to 24 hours.) Serve
  cold or at room temperature. Sprinkle with feta (if using).
  
  If available, substitute 2 teaspoons fresh oregano or dill for the
  dried oregano.
  
  NOTES : I've made a variation of this dish.  I added a chopped
  tomato, a handlful of chopped, pitted Kalamato olives, and doubled
  (or more) the feta cheese.  It's very good, and serves as a main dish
  for two. Could handle a bit more oregano. Also, I started with dry
  peas rather than tinned.

  hand that can easily be converted into an interesting vegetable dish
  ~ such as good quality frozen whole green beans, peas, or spinach."

      Title: GREEN BEAN & NEW POTATO SALAD
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 sm Clove garlic
      1 ts Tarragon vinegar
    1/4 c  Hellman's low fat mayo
           (1g_fat/Tbs)
      1 lb New potatoes (or other
           Potatoes)
      1 lb Fresh green beans
      1 ea Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Mince garlic very finely and blend into mayo along with vinegar. Set
  aside to let flavors to blend. Scrub potatoes well and cut into 1-1
  1/2" pieces. Place in steamer basket and steam until just tender
  (10-15 min). While the potatoes steam, trim ends off green beans and
  snap them in half. Rinse potatoes under cold water and place in
  strainer to cool while you steam the green beans just until
  crisp-tender (3-5 min). Rinse beans under cold water until cool and
  place in strainer to drain. Toss potatoes and beans with mayo mixture
  to coat and season with salt and pepper. You can chill this or just
  eat it at room temperature. I imagine some red, yellow or green bell
  pepper would also be good with this or maybe a little onion or celery.

  into the ice water to stop the cooking and set the colour.
  
  2. Place the green beans in a mixing bowl and combine with the cherry
  tomatos (washed and halved).
  
  3. Whisk the remaining ingredients together until smooth and well
  blended. Tos the dressing with the beans and tomatoes and serve
  immediately.
  
  NOTE: You can achieve an even more colourful look if you use half red
  and half yellow cherry tomatoes. You can make the salad up to six
  hours in advance and keep it refrigerated, tightly covered with
  plastic wrap. The beans can be steemed up to a day in advanced;
  however, do not add the cherry tomatoes or dress the salad longer
  than six hours before serving.

 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -================
           -(aka Country Curry or
           -Jungle Curry)
 
  Ingredients:
  
  1 lb  fresh green beans [if necessary, you may substitute whole frozen
  ones] 2 T Thai Curry Paste (I like to use the "Key" brand packets of
  either "Country Curry" or "Red Curry"; but they are all flavorful.
  Mae Ploy and Tommy Tang are other good brands. 2 T vegetable oil
  Bamboo shoots (optional; I like to use a large can of bamboo tips
  because they are tender and I can cut them into 1/4 inch thick round
  slices. You can also use a couple of the small cans of sliced bamboo
  shoots, but they will not absorb the flavor as well. I think carrots
  cut into coins would also be good, if you like those. I tried
  potatoes once, but they just disintegrated.) 6 c chicken broth Clean
  and pick green bean tips. In a dutch oven (or equivalent size
  vessel), heat oil.  Add curry paste and "fry" until fragrant, about 1
  minute.  Add broth, green beans, bamboo shoots (or other vegetable).
  Bring to a rapid boil and cook like that for about 15-20 minutes
  (watching that liquid doesn't reduce too much; add water as
  necessary). Reduce heat to a hard simmer and continue cooking until
  green beans are VERY done and have absorbed the flavor of the curry
  broth. Serve in bowls over rice.

     12 sm Pearl Onions, peeled
      1 lb Green beans
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
 
  1.  Put onions in a small amount of boiling salted water in a
  saucepan. Cover and cook 15 minutes, or until onions are tender. When
  finished, drain. 2. Meanwhile, wash fresh green beans, break off
  ends, and cut lengthwise into fine strips. Bring a small amount of
  water to boiling in saucepan, add 1/4 teaspoon salt and the prepared
  beans. Cover and cook 10 to 15 minutes, or until the beans are
  tender. Drain 3. Heat oil and garlic in a skillet until garlic is
  slightly browned. Add green beans and onions, season with salt and
  pepper, and cook 5 minutes util thoroughly heated. Stirring
  occasionally. 4. For vairiations, consider a small can of Italian,
  peeled Tomatoes or Tomatoes with/Jalepenos for a stightly Mexican
  flavor. While this recipe calls for fresh green beans, I have had
  good results with a 10 oz package of frozen, french cut, green beans.
  (I think the canned variety would not be suitable for this recipe,
  but who knows until you've tried it!)

      Title: GREEN BEANS & TOFU
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Olive oil
        x  Garlic
        x  Green beans (canned)
        x  Tofu
        x  Mushrooms
 
  Last week when I cooked some Green Beans I put a bit of Olive Oil in a
  stick-free skillet on medium heat, then minced a clove of Garlic into
  the oil and added some Black Pepper. I then cubed some firm Tofu and
  sliced some fresh mushrooms and put them in the pan to cook for a
  while and absorb the flavours.  Once the mushrooms reduced in size
  and got shiny from the cooking I poured a drained can of Green Beans
  into the sauce pan and cooked for about 10 minutes.  All you really
  need to do is let the beens cook up until they are all hot and
  steaming, but I usually let them cook a little longer which allows me
  to finish preparing the other things I'm making for the meal.
  
  I hope that helps.  It tastes great!

      Title: GREEN BEANS SOUTHERN STYLE
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Green beans, trimmed
           -and washed
      1 lg White onion, chopped
      1    Green (Bell) pepper,
           -chopped
    1/2 lb Sliced smoked bacon,
           -cut into squares
           Salt (it won't need much)
           And black pepper to taste
      6 sm New potatoes, (about the
           Size of golf balls),opt'l
 
  If the beans are very small and tender, leave them whole. Otherwise,
  cut in half lengthwise (known for some obscure reason as
  "Frenching"), and cut the individual beans into bite-sized lengths.
  
  Place the beans, onion, pepper, bacon into a large stewing pot. Cover
  with water.  Cover the pot, and cook on low heat until the beans are
  very tender (2-3 hours is about right -- these are NOT supposed to be
  crisp). About 30 minutes before serving, add the potatoes if used,
  and season to taste. Don't worry about overcooking the beans, you
  can't -- they're supposed to be a dull green and very tender
  :-)
  
  Serve the beans, along with a generous portion of the liquid, and the
  potatoes, if used.  This may be used as an accompaniment for any
  Southern-style meal, or may serve, with cornbread or biscuits on the
  side, as a meal itself.

  In a small bowl, mash the black beans into the garlic and ginger. In a

  occasionally until all the pink is gone--about 10 minutes. Then add
  the mashed fermented beans and stock, mix together and cook for 2
  minutes. Add the green beans, mix together and cook for 3 more
  minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl mix together the soy sauce, 2
  tablespoons of water and cornstarch until they form a paste. While

      Title: GREEN CHARD & SLIVERED CARROTS
 Categories: Vegetables, Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 tb Virgin olive oil
      1    Garlic clove; sliced
      2 sm Dried red chile peppers
           -=OR=- Double amount
      1 bn Swiss chard (about 1 1/2 lb)
      3 md Carrots
           Salt and pepper
           Vinegar
           -=OR=- Sliced Lemon Wedges
 
  This can be either a hot side dish or a room-temperature salad. WARM
  THE OLIVE OIL in a pan with the garlic and chile peppers. Once the
  garlic slices are brown, remove them and set the oil and peppers
  aside. Separate the chard stems from the leaves. Cut the leaves into
  large pieces and wash them. Trim the uneven ends off the stems. Then,
  to make the stems as tender as possible, peel off the thin,
  transparent outer skin from each stem. Catch the edge of a knife
  under the top layer of skin, and pull it down the length of the stem.
  It sometimes helps, especially if the stem is cured, to first cut the
  stem in half lengthwise. Peel both sides of the stems, cut them into
  2-inch lengths. Then lengthwise into narrow strips. Peel the carrots,
  slice them into long, 1/4-inch diagonals, then into narrow strips.
  Bring 4-to-5 quarts of water to a boil, and add 4 teaspoons of salt.
  Briefly cook the chard stems and the carrots separately until each is
  tender--about a minute for the carrots, 2-to-3 minutes for the chard.
  Remove them from the water and set them aside. Plunge the chard
  leaves into the water and cook until they are tender, 3-to-5 minutes,
  depending on the quality of the chard. When they are done, remove
  them to a colander. Press against the leaves with the back of a
  wooden spoon to get rid of the water then put them in a bowl with the
  stems and the carrots, and toss them with the olive oil. Season with
  salt and serve with vinegar or slices of lemon.

      Title: GREEN CHICKEN CHILAQUILES CASSEROLE
 Categories: Casseroles, Main dish, Mesamexican, Lnet
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lg Whole chicken breasts, split
           Salt
           Fresh course ground black
           -pepper
      2 c  Chicken stock
  3 1/2 c  *Tomatillo Salsa
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 md Onion, sliced paper thin
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
     12 ea Corn tortillas
      1 c  Grated manchego cheese
      1 c  Grated panela cheese
    1/2 c  Grated a¤ejo cheese
 
  Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.
  
  Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large saucepan. Place the
  breasts in the stock, reduce the heat to moderate, cover and cook
  until the meat is tender, about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool in the
  stock.
  
  When cool, remove the skin and bones and shred the meat into
  bite-sized pieces. Strain and reserve the stock for another use.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the fresh *tomatillo salsa, heavy
  cream, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, the onion and shredded
  chicken pieces.
  
  Heat the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat.
  
  Cook the tortillas just about 5 seconds per side to soften and then
  transfer to a large colander to drain.
  
  * See "Tomatillo Salsa" provided separately with this recipe.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350øF. Butter a 4-quart casserole.
  
  Combine the cheeses in a mixing bowl.
  
  To assemble the chilaquiles, spread a thin layer of the cheese
  mixture over the bottom of the baking dish. Push the solids in the
  bowl of chicken and tomatillo sauce to the side so the liquids form a
  pool in the bottom.
  
  Layer one third of the moist tortillas over the cheese and top with
  half of the chicken mixture with its sauce.
  
  Sprinkle half of the remaining cheese over the chicken. Repeat the
  layers, ending with a layer of torillas on top. Cover tightly with
  aluminum foil.
  
  Bake 30 minutes or until the edges are slightly brown. Let sit for 10
  minutes before slicing and serving or unmolding.

  over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until cooked through, but not
  browned. Discard the bay leaf and cool. Fry the green chiles in the

  Cut chicken breast in long strips and brown in skillet sprayed with
  non-stick cooking spray. ( I boiled mine, and used chicken breast
  tenders from Sam's; seasoned the boiling water with garlic powder and
  seasoning salt.)  Dip one side of the egg roll wrapper in egg while.
  The dipped side will be the outside of the roll. Place about 3-4
  strips of chicken just below center on the wrapper. ( I use 2
  boneless chicken tenderloins; seasoning which mesquite or grill
  seasoning). Sprinkle on about 1-2 tablespoon of green chilies. Don't
  use the mild. Top with 1/4 cup of chredded cheese.(Healthy Choice).
  Roll up egg roll. Place rolls on baking sheet sprayed with non-stick
  booking spray and bake in 350 degree oven for 20-25 minutes or until
  Golden Brown. Top with a little picante sauce. Delmonte's hot and
  spicy is good. Source: Fatfree and Ultralowfat Recipes by Doris Cross.

      1 cn Tomatillos
      4 lb Green chilis
      4 c  Wyler's chicken boullion
      3 tb Cornstarch
 
  chilis, tomato and tomatillos.  Add oil to heavy, preferably cast
  iron, skillet and brown chicken over high heat. It is best to do it
  in two or three small batches. Remove to large saucepan. Add onions
  and garlic to leftover oil and brown until onions are soft. Add
  oregano, cumin, and red chili, and cook for two or three minutes.
  Transfer from skillet to saucepan with chicken.  Add tomato,
  tomatillos, chilis, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and simmer for
  3 - 4 hours. Add water as necessary to maintain the desired
  consistency.  Add 3 - 4 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with water prior
  to serving to thicken as desired.
  
  Eat from a bowl accompanied with a warm flour tortilla or use it as a
  sauce over chili rellenos, eggs, enchiladas, or just about anything.
  One of my favorite meals is to grill a steak until nice and juicy,
  smother with green chili, sprinkle some grated cheese on top and
  serve with Mexican rice.

      Title: GREEN CORN TAMALES
 Categories: Mexican
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
     12    Ears of fresh white or
           Yellow corn
      1 lb Monterrey Jack cheese,
           Grated
      1 lb Pure lard
    1/2 lb Butter
    1/2 c  (scant) sugar
    1/4 c  Light cream, or more
      2    Green chiles, parched and
           Peeled
      1 lb Cheddar or Longhorn cheese
           Salt
 
     1.  Chop stalk end of each ear of corn flush with the base of the
  ear. Shuck, being careful to keep corn husks intact for later use.
  Wash husks, and drain.
  
     2.  Cut corn off cobs.  Grind corn with the Jack cheese in a meat
  grinder, blender or food processor.
  
     3.  Cream lard and butter to a smooth and fluffy consistency with
  an electric mixer at medium speed. Add the ground corn and cheese
  mixture, sugar, cream and salt to taste. Continue to mix with the
  electric mixer until mixture looks like whipped cream. Add more cream
  if mixture is dry.
  
     4.  Cut the roasted green chiles into long strips. Spread about 2
  tablespoons of the corn mixture on each corn husk. Spread mixture out
  into a rectangle and allow at least 2 inches of husk to extend below
  the corn mixture and a few inches of margin on both sides of the
  husk. Place about 2 strips of green chile down the center of the corn
  mixture, then sprinkle with a few pinches of the grated Cheddar
  cheese.
  
     5.  Hold the two sides of the tamale together to make the corn
  mixture fold up around the filling. Then tuck one edge of the husk
  over the top of the tamale and roll, tying the ends with strips of
  corn husks. If preferred, the bottom end of the husk can be folded up
  before rolling. If you plan to freeze the tamales, freeze them at
  this point.
  
     6.  Place the tamales upright on a rack in a pressure cooker or
  large steaming kettle.  Before the rack is completely filled with
  tamales, pour 1 to 2 cups water into the bottom of the pan, about 1/2
  inch deep.
  
     7.  Steam at 15 lbs pressure for 25 minutes, or in a conventional
  steamer for 45 minutes.  Serve warm with Green Chile Sauce, plain, or
  with beef, pork or chicken added. These may be kept in the
  refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.
  
  Makes 24 tamales.
  
  Freezing Hint:  Package tamales in plastic bags, 12 per package
                  or other suitable quantity.  If packaging large
                  quantities, keep track of the contents on a
                  card. Maximum Recommended Freezer Storage: 1 year

    1/8 ts Oregano
      1    Garlic clove; fresh, mashed

  1 1/2 dr Green food coloring
           Salad greens
 
  Mix the mayonnaise and sour cream until well blended.
   Add the tarragon vinegar and anchovy paste and blend.
   Let stand in the refrigerator for an hour.  Blend the rosemary,
  oregano and fresh garlic with the sugar and vinegar and let this
  mixture stand an hour at room temperature. Combine the two mixtures
  and blen in the onion and parsley.  Add food coloring as desired.
   Store in glass jar in the refrigerator.  Use as needed. Makes about
  1 1/2 qts. My changes:  I eliminate the tarragon vinegar in the mayo
  mixture, and use 1/4 cup tarragon vinegar in the herb mix. I use
  green onions (4 or 5) including tops.  I use 1 clove of garlic,
  pureed. I use 1 to 1 1/2 cups of parsley.  I do not put any food
  coloring in the mixture. I do the salad dressing in my food processor.
   Even a friend of ours who NEVER eats salad, eats it at our house
  when I make this dressing!

      1    Onion, finely chopped
      1    Carrot, chopped
      1    Green bell pepper, diced

    1/4 ts Cayenne
    1/2 ts Coriander
    1/2 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Curry powder

      1    Garlic clove, crushed
    1/4 ts Cumin
           Lemon juice

  Put lentils & hot water into a pot.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat &
  simmer, covered for 30 minutes.
  
  Heat margarine in a skillet, add onion & cook for 2 minutes. Add
  carrot & pepper & cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add
  spices, paste, salt & pepper. Mix together well.Then stir in lentils
  & let cool. Mix in parsley.
  
  Divide the mixture into 12 equal portions & shape into rounds. Coat
  them in combined breadcrumbs & oats (oats may have to be blended to
  resemble fine breadcrumbs). Shallow fry in hot oil until golden brown
  on both sides. Drain well.
  
  For the yogurt sauce, combine all the ingredients & chill till ready
  to serve.
  
  I find that I do not need to roll the rissoles in egg, though the
  recipe calls for it.

 Categories: Main dish, British, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------RISSOLES-------------------------------
      8 oz Green lentils
      1 pt Hot water
      2 oz Margarine
      1 ea Onion, finely chopped
      1 ea Carrot, finely chopped

      2 ts Tomato paste
           Salt & pepper, to taste
      1 tb Parsley, chopped

MMMMM--------------------------COATING-------------------------------
           Vegetable oil
      2 oz Wholewheat flour
      2 oz Breadcrumbs
      2 oz Oats

MMMMM------------------------YOGURT SAUCE-----------------------------
    1/2 pt Plain soy yogurt
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
      1 tb Chives
      1 ea Garlic clove, crushed
    1/4 ts Cumin
           Lemon juice, to taste
           Salt & pepper
 
  RISSOLES: Combine lentils & water, bring to a boil, reduce heat &
  simmer for 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender (I think it
  needs closer to an hour to get them really tender). Add more water if
  necessary. Heat the margarine, add the onion & cook for a couple of
  minutes. Add the carrot & pepper & cook until tender, about 10
  minutes. Add the spices, tomato paste & salt & pepper.  Mix together
  well & stir in the lentils. Add the parsley. Allow to cool till it is
  cool enough to handle. Divide the mixture into 12 portions & shape
  into patties. Coat them in flour, dip in some oil & coat in the
  breadcrumbs & oats (I omitted this step). Shallow fry in hot oil
  until the patties are golden brown on both sides. Drain well & serve
  with the sauce. SAUCE: Combine all ingredients together & chill.
  MARK'S NOTE: The vegetables do need to be finely diced, it may well
  be easier to use a food processor. Also, if using the oats, I'd
  recommend running them through the processor too so that they
  resemble oat flour.

      Title: GREEN PASTA
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    Extra large eggs
      6 oz Frozen chopped spinach,
           -defrosted, squeezed very
           -dry
  3 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
           Plus extra for dusting
           -worksurface
    1/2 ts Olive oil
 
  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
  board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil
  and spinach. Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and spinach
  and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the
  well.
  
  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well
  shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough
  will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
  hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
  the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
  board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
  elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
  remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
  plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
  
  Yield: 1 pound NOTES
  : Note:do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe,
  they are essential for a light pasta.

           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      3    Poblano peppers
  1 3/4 c  Reduced-sodium chicken broth
      2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 md Onion; minced
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 c  Long-grain white rice
    1/2 c  Fresh or frozen corn kernels
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
      1 tb Parsley; minced
      2 tb Cilantro; chopped
 
  Preheat oven broiler.  Place peppers on a baking sheet and broil as
  close to heat as possible, turning until charred all over, about 10
  minutes. Or roast peppers directly over a gas flame, turning, until
  charred, about 5 minutes.  Place peppers in a paper bag and let steam
  10 minutes. Peel off blackened skin and rinse under cold running
  water. Cut peppers open, discard stems and seeds. Chop peppers
  coarsely and place in a blender or food processor.  Add 1/2 cup of
  chicken broth and puree until smooth.
  
  In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and
  garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not brown, about 2
  minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, until coated with oil and
  opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining chicken broth and pureed
  chilies. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15
  minutes, or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.
  
  Add corn kernels, salt, pepper, and parsley.  Stir gently to combine.
  Cover and let stand off heat 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro and serve.

 Categories: Dressings, Salads, Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Mixed salad greens
           Peanut oil
           Rice vinegar
           Fresh squeezed lime juice
           Thai fish sauce; * see note

           Chopped fresh red thai chile
           Green onions; sliced thin
           Peanut butter
           Chopped roasted peanuts
 
  Recipe by: NURPPL@NURSE.EMORY.EDU Essentially, this is just a peanutty
  vinagrette dressing that I made in the food processor. I added the
  liquid ingredients first, until it looked like the right mix of oil
  to acidic liquids (rice vinegar and lime juice). Then I added the
  rest of the ingredients and processed for a few seconds. From there I
  just went by appearance and taste, adding more liquid or peanut
  butter to get the right consistency, and more of each of the other
  ingredients for other various characteristics-- sweetness, saltiness,
  acidity, spiciness. We served the salad dressing on the side with the
  salad, and provided extra chopped peanuts, cilantro, and green onions
  to let people add their own to taste.

 Categories: Soups, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 md Onion
      1 lg Carrot (about 5 oz)
  1 1/2 ts Butter
      3 c  Meat broth, hot
      1 tb Savory (fresh,
           -chopped fine)
      1 ts Tarragon (fresh,
           -chopped fine)
      1 lb Peas (cooked in
           -lightly salted water)
      5 oz Shrimp (deveined,
           -cooked and cut into
           -small pieces)
    1/2 c  White wine, dry
      2 tb Cream
      1 c  Champagne (demi sec)
 
  Chop the onion and carrot finely.  Heat the butter in a pan and fry
  the vegetables for 5 minutes stirring continuously. Add the hot meat
  broth. Boil for 10 minutes.
  
  Add savory, tarragon and peas.  Bring to a boil and let cook for 8
  minutes. Strain the soup and put it back into the pan.
  
  Add shrimp.  Simmer 5 minutes on medium heat.  (Be sure the soup is
  not boiling.)  Add white wine and cream. Take from the heat. Season if
  necessary.  Add champagne and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fine pea soup with shrimp and champagne -- This is a recipe out of
  a German low-calorie cookbook. It is a simple recipe for a really
  delicate soup. It can be served as a festive appetizer or as a
  gourmet snack.
  
  *  The fresh spices can be substituted by dried spices.
  
  *  If you use canned shrimp, never let them boil. They would become
  tough and lose their delicate taste.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  40 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: GREEN SPAGHETTI SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    16 oz bag frozen or fresh
           Spinach
           (or a combination
           Frozen/fresh)
      1    Clove garlic,
           Crushed/minced
    1/2 c  Plain soy milk/skim milk
        x  Salt
 
  If using fresh spinach, wash and de-stem the leaves. Steam/microwave
  the spinach until cooked.  Place it in a blender with the garlic and
  milk. Whir until you have a nice sauce consistency. Start with less
  milk if you like a thicker sauce, add more, as needed. It depends on
  how much spinach "juice" you use.  Taste the sauce, and add salt, as
  desired.
  
  Serve on top of spaghetti or other pasta
  
  Makes 2-3 servings, with pasta
  
  NOTES: This makes a bright green sauce...kinda weird to look at but
  very good tasting.  It's a real pretty presentation if you serve it
  over spaghetti, half green, half tomato sauce.
  
  It's especially good with Parmesan, if you are lacto-veg. Use fat
  free, of course, or a tiny bit of "the good stuff".
  
  DO NOT use vanilla flavored soy milk. I tried it. Yuk.

 Categories: Sauces, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 oz Hulled raw pumpkin seeds OR
      3 c  Chicken stock (no salt)
      2 ea Jalapenos or serranos (2-3)
      3 ea Garlic cloves, rough chopped
    1/4 ts Cumin seeds or ground cumin
    3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
      5 ea Lg Romaine lettuce leaves OR
      1 x  Salt to taste
      3 oz Pine nuts
    3/4 lb Tomatillos, husked & washed
    1/2 ea Medium onion, rough chopped
      4 ea Cilantro sprigs (4-5)
    3/4 ea Inch cinnamon stick OR
      2 ea Whole cloves OR pinch ground
      5 ea Leaf lettuce leaves
      1 tb Safflower or sunflower oil
 
  Toast the pumpkin seeds in a dry frying pan, shaking pan or stirring
  constantly until they are browned and toasty (for pine nuts) or until
  they have browned and popped (for pumpkin seeds). Remove from the
  heat and transfer to a blender jar if you're using pine nuts or to a
  bowl if you're using pumpkin seeds.  If you're using pine nuts, blend
  with 1 cup of the stock until smooth, then strain through a
  medium-mesh strainer. If you're using pumpkin sees, pulverize in a
  spice mill in batches and sift into a bowl.  Stir in 1 cup of the
  stock and mix well. Set aside. Simmer tomatillos in water to cover
  with the chilies (remove stems, seeds and membranes from chilies) and
  simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and place in the blender jar.  Add
  the onion, garlic, and cilantro. Grind the spices in a spice mill and
  add to the blender jar. Add the lettuce leaves and salt. Blend until
  the mixture is smooth. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan or
  casserole over medium heat. Add the nut or seed mixture and cook,
  stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Add
  the tomatillo mixture and cook again, stirring for about 5 to 10
  minutes, until the mixture is thick. Stir in the remaining 2 cups
  chicken stock, bring to a simmer, cover partially, and simmer for 30
  minutes. Taste and correct seasonings. If the mixture seems too
  thick, stir in a little more chicken stock. Yield: About 3 cups
  sauce. Serve with grilled or poached chicken breasts as main course.
  Use as a dip with crudites, as a topping for nachos or enchiladas.
  Add lime or lemon juice or vinegar and use as a salad dressing.
   Sauce freezes well.

      Title: GREEN TOMATO CHUTNEY
 Categories: Relishes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Green tomatoes
    1/2 lb Tart green apples
      6    Dried chili peppers (each
           1" long)
    1/2 lb Peeled shallots or small
           Onions
    1/2 c  Packed golden raisins
      1 c  Packed dark brown sugar
      1 tb Grated crystallized ginger
  1 1/2 ts Minced garlic (about 3
           Cloves)
  1 1/4 c  Cider vinegar
 
  Cut the tomatoes into 1/2 inch cubes, to measure about 6 cups. Peel,
  core, and slice the apples, to measure about 2 cups. If you are using
  dried whole chiles, break them up and remove some seeds, if you want
  a milder chutney. For easy peeling of the shallots or onions, first
  cover them with boiling water, stir, drain, and immerse in cold water
  to prevent their cooking. Drain again, and peel. Place all the
  ingredients in a wide 4-quart saucepan, bring to a boil quickly, and
  boil about 30 minutes, or until the chutney is as thick as jam.  Stir
  occasionally to prevent sticking. Ladle into hot, sterilized jars,
  seal, cool, label, and store. Makes 3 pints (Note: Shallots are
  preferred, but if you use onions, substitute either
  :       raw pearl onions or frozen small boiling onions)

      Title: GREEN-AND-GOLD RELISH
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables, Chinese, Relishes
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
     10 oz Greens; Spinach -OR-
           -- Garland chrysanthemum
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Cider vinegar
           -OR- Chinese dark vinegar
  1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
 
  NOTE: Buy 11 ounces of greens (if stems of garland chysanthemum are
  thick, buy 14 ounces) in order to have 10 ounces after trimming.
  Include stems of both vegetables; however, if garland chysanthemum
  stems exceed 1/4 inch in thickness, do not use them for this recipe
  since they may be too firm, tough, or stringy.
  
  Wilt the greens by immersing them in a large pot of boiling water for
  30 seconds (or steam in a vegetable basket, 1-1/2 minutes for
  spinach, 2-1/2 minutes for garland chysanthemum, stirring once or
  twice).
  
  Rinse in cold water to stop the cooking.  Divide into two or three
  bunches and firmly squeeze out the water. Chop each handful at
  1/2-inch intervals, then turn and chop in a cross direction. Squeeze
  again if the greens are still watery, then loosen them by a light
  crumbling motion and place in a bowl.
  
  Pour boiling water over the bamboo shoot to freshen it; rinse under
  cool water and dice finely (1/4 inch thick).
  
  Toss all ingredients together.  Let sit a few minutes at room
  temperature, and test for seasonings, adding perhaps an extra 1/4
  teaspoon sugar with garland chysanthemum. Serve chilled or at room
  temperature.

  Cut the aubergine and pepper into chunks; cut the onions into wedges;
  slice the courgettes into 1-to 1-1/2-inch lengths; leave the
  mushrooms whole. Mix together all flavouring ingredients.  Toss the
  vegetables in the flavourings and marinate for 2 to 4 hours.
     The sauce should be part-prepared well ahead.  Chop the onion and
  garlic roughly, then whizz them in a food-processor or blender with
  the coriander seeds. Add the chili, oil and anchovy essence and whizz
  again. Add the peanut butter, lemon juice and honey and process once
  more. Scrape the puree into a small saucepan, cover and set aside for
  at least 1 hour before cooking.
     Thread the vegetables on to skewers and grill under moderate heat
  for 10-15 minutes, basting with the marinade liquid as necessary.
  Meanwhile, add 5 tablespoons warm water to the pan of sauce and set
  it over medium heat.  Cook at a steady bubble, stirring often, until
  the sauce is hot and aromatic.  Reduce heat to a very low and cook
  for a few minutes longer, adding more water if necessary to achieve a
  good creamy consistency, and adjust seasoning to taste. Hand round
  the sauce separately.

      Yield: 50 Won tons
 
    1/2 lb Ground Beef and Pork mix
    1/2 c  Onion - finely chopped
    1/2 lb Cabbage - shredded
      1 cn Bean Sprouts - well drained
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Soy Sauce
      1 tb Peanut Butter(more to taste)
      1 ts Sugar
 
  Mix ingredients well.
  
  Spoon into egg roll wrappers (for fullsize egg rolls) or won ton
  skins (for smaller appetizers) following package directions. Deep fat
  fry in enough peanut oil to cover in batches until golden brown.
  
  I prefer more peanut butter (chunky) and to use the smaller won ton
  skins as they are easier to wrap and faster to cook.
  
  These do NOT have a pronounced peanut butter flavor but taste similar
  to Cashews which are commonly used in oriental cooking.

      Title: GREG'S FAVOURITE PASTA
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 4 -6 serving
 
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached flour;
           - (do not use all purpose,
           - it's too soft)
      1 c  Semolina flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Olive oil
      3 lg Whole eggs
      1 tb Warm water (if needed)
 
  Mix dry ingredients on a board forming a well in the center Add olive
  oil and eggs to well. Mix with a fork by gradually blending in the
  dry to the egg. When it gets too stiff to use a fork, begin to knead
  by hand to proper consistency (should be very stiff) If necessary,
  add warm water in small increments.
  
  Allow dough to rest while covered for at least 10 minutes. Using a
  floured board, cut off pieces of dough about the size of an egg.
  Flatten with the palm or your hand. Process through pasta machine by
  starting on the thickest setting. Roll through machine again at each
  progressively thinner setting to form long strips the width of your
  machine and the proper thickness for the desired style of pasta.
  (this helps to incorporate the ingredients) At this point I gently
  rub a small amount of flour on the surface and allow to air dry for
  about 30 minutes. (this makes cutting easier) Attach cutting head for
  the desired pasta type. Cut, lay-out on floured board, sprinkle
  lightly with flour and allow to dry further. Can be cooked now or
  rolled in freezer paper and frozen for later.
  
  Remember, fresh pasta cooks a lot faster than the cardboard box
  variety. Don't over-cook. If cut with a medium width head, these make
  great chicken and noodles or cut thin for spaghetti.
  
  By using 1 egg per cup of flour yields great looking and tasting
  slightly golden pasta.  For those more health conscious, I believe
  that the number of eggs can be reduced and replaced with water. A
  little Saffron will put back the great rich looking color.

      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    2/3 c  Finely chopped fresh parsley
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
  1 1/2 tb Grated lemon rind*
 
  *I coarsely chopped some I'd frozen, and processed in a
  mini-Cuisinart. Took about 3 pieces.
  
  Combine and mix all ingredients together thoroughly. Best if made at
  least 30 minutes in advance, to allow flavors to blend.
  
  Yield: 2/3 cup.
  
  Note: This stuff is delicious!  I keep some on hand most of the time.
  
  Ogden writes: "A traditional Italian condiment, we love it as a quick
  and healthy topping for lightly buttered baked potatoes, plain
  broiled chicken, or any mild-flavored veal dish." (Would also be good
  on fish or French bread, and possibly grilled hamburgers.)

      Title: GRENADINE (POMEGRANATE SYRUP)
 Categories: Beverages, Fruits
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      2    Pomegranates, medium-large*
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  ;Water
 
  *When choosing pomegranates, reject any with a brownish area on the
  blossom end; such discoloration indicates the beginning of spoilage
  and off-flavor. Cut pomegranates open crosswise and pry out the
  fleshy crimson seeds (the red part is actually the pulpy envelope
  around a seed), using the tip of a blunt knife. Be careful not to
  include any fragments of the cottony white pulp in which the seeds
  are embedded, as it is bitter. You should have about two cups of
  seeds. Using a food processor or blender, chop the seeds with the
  sugar and water just long enough to make a rough puree. Don't attempt
  to make a smooth mixture; it's necessary only to break open the pulpy
  membranes. Pour the puree into an earthenware or glass bowl; cover it
  with a cloth. Let stand at room temperature for 3 days, stirring it
  daily. If the weather is extremely hot, refrigerate the puree after
  24 hours. Line a sieve with dampened, very fine nylon net or two
  layers of dampened fine cheesecloth and set it over a saucepan of
  stainless-steel or other nonreactive material. Filter the pomegranate
  syrup into the pot, allowing it to drip without pressing on the pulp.
  This will take a few hours; you can speed matters up by tying the
  cheesecloth lining of the sieve into a bag and suspending it above
  the pot after the initial flow of juice has slowed down. When all the
  juice has dripped through, discard the seedy pulp. Bring the syrup to
  a bare simmer (180 F) over medium-low heat, then reduce the heat to
  very low and scald the syrup, using a candy/jelly thermometer and
  watching to be sure you keep the temperature below 200 F, for 3
  minutes. Skim off any foam, then funnel the syrup into a sterilized,
  dry bottle. Let the syrup cool, then cap or cork the bottle (use a
  new cork only) and store it in the refrigerator. To seal the syrup
  for pantry storage, funnel it into hot, clean half-pint canning jars.
  Seal with new two-piece canning lids according to manufacturer's
  directions. Following the method for a boiling-water bath, but
  keeping the water at simmering temperature (190 F), process the jars
  for 15 minutes. Cool, label, and store. Yield: About 2 cups. Keeps in
  either the refrigerator or, after canning, in the pantry for at least
  a year.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Portion Four-Way Sweet 1/2
           -cup grenadine syrup
 
  *Use Grated Raw Potato Starter
  
  Bread Dough                     1 cup Grape-Nuts Cereal
  
  As soon as the bread dough has started to rise mix the syrup and
  grape-nuts together so that the cereal will have time to soak up all
  the syrup. Roll the dough out quite thin to about 20 x 10 inches. Cut
  in two crosswise. Spread filling thinly over the surface leaving a
  2-inch strip along one side of each square. Fold over this bare strip
  onto filling and continue folding until a flat roll is formed. Lay
  both rolls lengthwise on 10 x 15 inch cookie sheet with seam on
  underside. Flatten them by rolling with the pin until they are about
  3-1/2 inches wide and as long as the pan. Do this gently so that the
  filling does not break through. Brush tops with soft butter.  Let
  stand in warm place until light. Bake in oven preheated to 325 about
  45 minutes until the crust has a beautiful bisque tint. Glaze while
  still warm with a powdered sugar and White Wine frosting. If
  available, decorate with a row of candy raspberries down the center
  of each roll so that there will be one on each 1- 1/2 inch to 2 inch
  slice. (If rolls are to be frozen for later use wait until they have
  been thawed and warmed to glaze and decorate.)
  
  White Wine Frosting: 2 Tbsp. soft butter 2 Tbsp. white wine 1 1/2 cup
  powdered sugar 3 drops Waldmeister Essence* and a drop or tow of green
  coloring or 1/4 tsp. Rose extract and a drop or two of red coloring
  
  Beat butter, wine and sugar together until smooth. Add preferred
  flavoring and carefully add the coloring for a very delicate tint.

      Title: GRIDDLE SCONES
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Self-rising flour
      1 pn Salt
      3 tb Butter or margarine
    2/3 c  Currants
    3/4 ts Groung nutmeg
      1    Egg
    1/3 c  Milk
 
  Keywords: Scones, sugar free, bread
  
  Preparation time  15 minutes, cooking time about 4 minutes per scone.
  
  Mix the flour and salt together, and rub in the butter until the
  mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
  
  Stir in the currants and nutmeg, then push the mixture gently to the
  sides of the bowl to form a well in the center.
  
  Beat together the egg and milk, and pour into the well in the center
  of the flour.
  
  Using a wooden spoon, mix the egg and milk mixture into the flour,
  stirring from the center of the bowl and drawing the flour in from
  the sides to form a smooth, thick batter. If batter is too thick, add
  a little extra milk until it becomes a soft dropping consistency.
  
  Heat a heavy-based frying pan on top of a moderate heat, and grease
  with a little butter or oil.
  
  Drop tablespoons of the batter into the hot pan, and cook for 2-3
  minutes, or until the bases are set and have turned golden brown.
  
  Turn the scones over and cook on the other side in the same way.
  
  Serve from the pan with sugar-free preserves.
  
  NOTE:  These scones freeze well, and can be re-heated by wrapping in a
  clean dish towel and standing in a warm oven until they are heated
  through.

  variations. Sometimes called empanadas, these turnovers have evolved
  through the years. Traditionally, masa dough is flattened and folded
  over to enclose a variety of fillings.

  1. In a deep medium skillet or a large saucepan, bring the chicken
  stock (or enough of a combination of chicken stock and water to cover
  the chicken) to a simmer. If you're using water only, add 1/2
  teaspoon salt. Add the chicken breast and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes
  or until just tender. Cool the chicken in the stock. Drain the
  chicken, remove the skin, and shred it into bite-size slices.
  
  2. Heat the oil in large non-aluminum casserole over medium-high

  15 minutes or until well softened.
  
  3. Add the beer, vinegar, sugar, and jalapenos to the onions and

  brown, then turn over and cook the other side until lightly brown.
  Place on a cutting board, slice into bite-size wedges, and keep warm
  under foil.
  
  5. Repeat to cook the remaining quesadillas. Arrange on a large

    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Garlic; minced
      1 tb Fresh ginger; minced
      1 tb Juniper berries; crushed
      1 tb Grated orange peel
      4    Boneless chicken breasts;
           -skinless (about 1-1/2 lb
           -total)
      2    Firm, ripe mangoes; (about
           -2 lb total)
      2    Oranges
      1 tb Ground coriander
      1 tb Chinese five spice powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
      1 tb Dijon mustard
      6 c  Frisee salad greens; (about
           -1/2 lb), root ends trimmed,
           -rinsed, and crisped (other
           -salad greens may be used)
      8 c  Butter leaves; (about 1 lb)
           -rinsed and crisped
    1/2 c  Raspberries (optional)
 
  In a large bowl, combine soy, oil, garlic, ginger, juniper berries,
  and orange peel.  Add chicken; marinate 15 minute, turning often.
  
  Meanwhile, with a sharp knife, cut skin from mangoes. Cut 2 rounded
  cheeks from each pit.  Trim remaining 1/2-inch of flesh from edge of
  each mango; mince these trimmings and reserve for mango vinaigrette.
  Cut and discard peel and white membrane from oranges.  Slice each
  orange crosswise into 6 rounds; set aside.
  
  Combine coriander, five spice, salt, pepper.  Lift chicken from
  marinade; place on a baking sheet (reserve marinade for basting). Set
  mango cheeks on a lightly oiled grill above a solid bed of hot coals
  in a barbecue with a lid, or use a gas grill on high heat (you can
  hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas
  grill. Baste chicken and mango with reserved marinade.  Using a
  spatula, turn chicken and mangoes when they start to brown, in about
  5 minutes. Baste again; cover barbecue. Let chicken and mango cook
  until no pink remains when chicken is cut in thickest part, about 15
  to 20 minutes; turn and baste chicken and mangoes every 5 minutes
  (depending on mango ripeness, cooking time may be less than for the
  chicken; remove mangoes when soft and seared).
  
  Meanwhile, combine minced mango with vinegar and mustard. Mix with
  frisee and lettuce.  Evenly divide among 4 dinner plates.
  
  Lay mangoes cut side down; slice each into 3/8-inch wide slices,
  starting 1/2 inch from top down through wide bottom end. With a wide
  spatula, transfer slices to plates atop greens. Gently fan slices
  apart. Lay chicken and oranges next to mangoes; sprinkle with
  raspberries.

 Categories: Veal, Grill
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Shallots
      2    Garlic cloves
      2    Sprigs fresh rosemary
      3 c  Balsamic vinegar; divided
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 ts Kosher salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      4    Veal chops; 10 oz each
      1 c  Balsamic vinegar
      4 ts Basil-infused oil
      4    Sprigs fresh thyme (garnish)
 
  To be served with Balsamic Ratatouille and Mashed Potatoes
  w/Mascarpone Cheese & Roasted Garlic
  
  1. Roughly chop shallots, garlic and rosemary. Place in a casserole
  dish large enough to hold the veal chops, along with 2 cups balsamic
  vinegar and the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Add chops, cover, and
  marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours.
  
  2. Remove veal chops from marinade. Place on a hot grill. Cook at
  medium temperature, turning once, for 9 to 13 minutes, until done to
  your liking. If using a gas grill, the barbecue experts who staff the
  Weber Grill Line (1-800-474-5568) recommend grilling the chops over
  medium heat using the indirect method until chops reach 160 degrees
  for medium and 170 degrees for well-done.
  
  3. Meanwhile, reduce remaining 1 cup balsamic vinegar by placing it
  in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring frequently, until
  thick and syrupy, about 8 to 10 minutes. (Do not let vinegar boil
  rapidly or it will burn.) You will get about 4 teaspoons.
  
  4. To assemble: On a warm plate, place 1/4 of the ratatouille in the
  center of each plate. Place 1/4 of the mashed potatoes on top of each
  serving of ratatouille. Drizzle 1 teaspoon basil oil over each
  serving of potatoes. Lay grilled chops over potatoes and drizzle 1
  teaspoon reduced balsamic vinegar over each. Garnish with thyme
  sprigs.

  the steaks with the oil.
  
  Grill steaks until well-seared on the surface, about 5 minutes. Turn
  over and cook until you reach desired doneness, about 4 minutes for
  medium-rare, depending on the thickness.
  
  Brush tops of steaks with a small amount of Red Wine Sauce, then
  press the steaks, top side down, into the pistachio mixture, coating
  the surface well.  Position the steaks on serving plates, spoon the
  remaining sauce around them, garnish with parsley sprigs and serve.
  
  Note:  The nut garnish/topping can be added to the sauce, just before

      Title: GRILLED BEET & SMOKED TROUT SALAD WITH CHIV
 Categories: Appetizers, Jaw, Salads, Fish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 lg Red beets
      3 c  Rice vinegar
      4 c  Water
      2 tb Mustard seeds
      1 tb Anise seed
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Cumin seed
      4 oz Grape seed oil
      1    Bunch fresh chives
           Salt to taste
      1 oz Lemon juice
     12 oz Whole smoked rainbow trout

MMMMM------------------------FOR GARNISH-----------------------------
      4 sm Bunches of baby leaf lettuce
           Zest of 1 lemon
 
  Peel the beets and slice into 1/4 inch thick rounds. In a nonreactive
  pot combine the venegar, seeds, and sugar. Bring to a boil and reduce
  by half. Add the water and bring back to a boil. Add beets and cook
  until done but still firm. Remove from heat and let beets cool in
  liquid. (The beets can be done a week ahead.)
  
  To make the lemon vinegar: Combine 2 ounces of the strained cooking
  liquid from the beets with the lemon juice. If necessary, remove the
  bones from the trout. Bones can be easily removed by taking out the
  backbone, and the pin bones for the most part will come with it. Peel
  skin off the fillets. Flake the fish gently into small pieces about
  the size of lump crab meat. Store the fish in the refrigerator or
  until ready to serve.
  
  To make the chive oil: Combine the chives with the grape seed oil in a
  blender. Puree until smooth; season with salt.
  
  To assemble the salad: Remove the beets from the liquid and cook on a
  grill or in a skillet until warmed. Place three slices of beet onto
  each plate. Drizzle about 1 T chive oil around beets; do the same
  with the lemon vinegar. Divide the trout into equal portions and
  place a small pile of trout on top of the beets. Finish salads by
  placing one small bunch of baby lettuce in the center of each plate
  and sprinkling with lemon zest.

  SPREAD EACH PIECE OF BREAD with thin coating of pureed chiles, or
  more if you like your sandwich really hot. Cover bottom slice with
  layer of cheese, tomato and onion slices and as much cilantro as you
  like. Top with second slice of bread and butter it. Place sandwich,
  butter-side down, in cast-iron skillet. Spread top piece of bread
  with butter as well and cook sandwich slowly. When golden brown on
  bottom, turn it over and cook on the other side. Covering pan will
  help melt cheese by the time bread is crisped and golden. Eat right

  LIGHT A GRILL OR PREHEAT a broiler. Pound the chicken breasts to an
  even thickness, and grill or broil on both sides until cooked
  through, but not dried out, about 4 minutes on a side. It makes sense
  to grill the peppers at the same time. Slice, and set aside. Combine
  the bell peppers, celery, onion, black beans and cilantro in a mixing
  bowl. Combine the vinegar, oil, orange juice, lime juice, garlic,
  coriander, pepper. Combine with salt and sour cream or yogurt in a
  jar with a tight-fitting lid. Shake well, and pour the dressing over
  the vegetables. Marinate the vegetables for 1 hour at room
  temperature. Place a large skillet over medium heat, and grill the
  tortillas for 30 seconds on a side to soften. To serve, divide the
  chicken among the tortillas, placing it at the center of the
  tortilla. Divide the vegetables and their dressing on top of the
  chicken, and roll the tortilla into a cylinder. Serve immediately;
  the dish should be at room temperature. Serves 6. Note: The chicken
  breasts, vegetable mixture and dressing can all be prepared a day in
  advance. Do not marinate the vegetables for more than 1 hour. Cover
  with aluminum foil to reheat. Reheat the chicken in a 300F oven for
  15 minutes.

      1    Boneless chicken breast,
           -skin on is best, but
           -skinless will work
      1 tb Mayonnaise
      1 ts Spicy mustard (I use

      Title: GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST SANDWICHES WITH ROASTE
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Chicken breast halves
           Without skin -- boned &
           Skinned
      5 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Black pepper -- cracked
      2 tb Fresh thyme
      2    Red bell peppers
    1/2 c  Mayonnaise
    1/4 c  Dijon mustard
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Red wine vinegar
      1 ds Salt
      3 oz Arugula leaves
      3    Red ripe tomatoes -- for
           Slicing
     12 sl Multi-grain bread
 
  STEP ONE: For the Chicken-- Rub the chicken breasts with 3
  tablespoons of the olive oil, the black pepper, and thyme leaves.
  Cover and refrigerate a minimum of 6 hours, preferably overnight.
  Remove from refrigerator
        1    hour before cooking.
  
  STEP TWO: For the Peppers-- Preheat oven to 500 degrees and place 2
  red bell peppers on the rack and roast. Turn the peppers occasionally
  until the skins are completely charred (20 to 30 minutes). Place the
  peppers in a paper bag and seal the top. This allows them to steam
  and aids in peeling. Remove the peppers from the bag and remove the
  skins with your fingers. Sometimes a little cold running water helps.
  Remove the cores and seeds and slice into 1/4-inch strips. Toss the
  peppers with 2 tablespoons olive oil and store in a glass container
  until ready to use.
  
  If a charcoal fire is available, you can roast the peppers directly
  on the coals. This can be very tricky, so you need to watch them
  constantly. As the peppers begin to char, turn them so they char
  evenly. Once you have an even char, proceed as in oven roasting. The
  charcoal roasting imparts a smoky flavor that enhances the sandwich.
  
  STEP THREE: For the Sauce-- Mix mayonnaise, Dijon mustard,
  Worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar, and dash of salt together
  well and refrigerate in a glass container until ready to use.
  
  STEP FOUR: Assembling the Sandwiches-- The chicken, peppers, and
  mustard sauce can be prepared to this point a day in advance. When
  you are ready to serve the sandwiches, prepare a charcoal fire or
  preheat the broiler for the chicken and bread. Grill or broil the
  breasts 6 to 10 minutes per side, depending on the heat of your fire.
  As they are cooking, brush a little butter or olive oil  on one side
  of 12 slices of the bread. When the breasts are cooked, transfer to a
  platter and allow to cool slightly, at which time you will need to
  either grill or broil the bread until slightly toasted. Spread a
  liberal amount of the mustard sauce on the oiled or buttered side of
  the bread slices so that the dry sides will be on the outside of the
  sandwich.
  
  Slice the breasts on a diagonal and place each sliced breast on a
  slice of toasted bread. Top with some of the roasted pepper strips, 2
  slices of tomato, some of the arugula, and the top piece of bread.
  Cut and serve as you would with any sandwich. Serve immediately.
  
  Can be served with cole slaw or "Roasted Potato Salad" (see recipe.)

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Chicken breast halves,
           -boneless
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Salad oil
      2 tb Honey
      2 tb Fresh, strained lime juice
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper

MMMMM------------------------MANGO SALSA-----------------------------
      2    Mangos (about 1 lb. each) **
    1/2 c  Finely diced red onion
    1/2 c  Cucumbers - see instructions
      2    Peppers, seeded and diced
           Juice of two limes
    1/2 ts Salt

MMMMM-------------------BASIC-CAPER MAYONNAISE------------------------
      2    Egg yolks
  1 1/2 tb Strained fresh lime juice
    1/4 ts SALT, HEAPING
 
  Cucumbers should be finely dice, unpeeled.-
  
  Trim the chicken breast halves of all fat and gristle and separate the
  tenderloin.  Mix soy, oil, honey, lime juice, salt, and cayenne in a
  shallow dish just large enough to hold the chicken in one close layer.
  Marinate the chicken in this mixture for 1 hour at room temperature
  or for several hours the refrigerator, turning several times. Grill
  the chicken breasts for 3 to 4 minutes per side, the tenderloins
  about 2 minutes per side.  The chicken may also be sauteed over
  moderate heat in a skillet lightly filmed with oil.  The bottom of
  the skillet will darken as the honey caramelizes but is easily
  cleaned.
  
  Cut the breasts in thick slices and fan on dinner plates, placing the
  tenderloins along side.  Spoon the salsa over the top and drizzle
  with the mayonnaise.
  
  MANGO SALSA
  
  Slice the mango flesh from each side of the pit.  One half at a time,
  make an inch cut just inside the skin, then score the flesh in
  3/8-inch cubes. Turn skin inside out and free the mango flesh with
  the knife. Cut the cubes in inch dice, reserving any mushy pieces for
  some other use. You should end up with about 1 1/2 cups. Combine
  mango with all remaining ingredients and let sit 30 minutes to blend
  flavor.
  
  **  Note:  1 1/2 Cups peach or papaya dice may be substituted for the
  mango.

    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1    Clove of Garlic, minced
      1    Problano Chili

           - Montery Jack cheese
      1 c  Salsa or guacamole -optional
 
  Preparation time:  20 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes
  
  [Note: the serving size (24) is the number of "peices you will get --
  not necessarily how many people it will feed.]
  
  1. Heat grill or broiler and cook chicken until done (approx. 5
  minutes on each side).  Cool to reoom temperature and shred inot
  1/4-inch peices. 2. Over gas burner or under broiler, place poblano
  pepper and char skin until black all over, rotate as necessary. Place
  pepper in a bag and close. After about 15 minutes remove pepper from
  bag and remove charred skin, seeds, and stem.  Cut pepper into
  1/2-inch strips. 3. Place 4 tortillas on table and top each with 3/4
  cup of cheese, a pinch of chili powder, 1/2 cup of shredded chicken
  and divided poblano strips. Top with remaining tortillas. 4. Heat an
  8-inch or larger skillet -- dry, no oil -- over medium high heat.
  Place quesadilla, one at a time in skillet and cook until golden
  brown (about 1 minute) Turn over and cook another minute. 5. Let cool

  [Another Note:  Now that I have typed this into the database, I see
  that nowhere in this recipe does it tell you when to add the spices
  ~- other than the chili powder (which was not listed in the
  "ingredients," originally -- I had to go back and insert that) or
  what to do with the vegetable oil.  I assume one might mix the spices
  in the cooking oil and smear it over the chicken breast before
  grilling or broiling. Suggestions, of course, will be appreciated.
  Complaints will be ignored.]

 Categories: Vegetables, Grill
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6 tb Butter, unsalted, room temp
      1 tb Cilantro leaves, chopped
    1/4 ts Chili powder
    1/8 tb Cumin, ground
      8 ea Corn on cob With husks
 
  Combine the butter, cilantro, chili powder and cumin, set aside.
  Carefully peel back corn husks to within an inch of bottom of the
  cob. Discard the silks.  Rub ears of corn evenly with the reserved
  butter mixture. Rewrap corn husks and tie at the top with kitchen
  string. Soak, covered, in cold water for 20 minutes. Preheat the
  grill to medium-high. Grill the corn 5 inches above the heat source
  for 15 minutes, turning occasionally. Remove from the heat and serve.

      Title: GRILLED CORN ON THE COB
 Categories: Vegetables, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Corn on the cob
 
  Buy the corn still in the husks. Strip back the husks without tearing
  them off.  Pull out all of the silks and kind of scrub at the ear to
  get the silks out (silks are the stringy parts for all of you
  non-midwesterners :)). Pull the husks back up over the ear to
  completely encase it. Soak the ears in a bucket of salt water
  overnight. Take the ears directly from the bucket and put them on the
  grill to cook. To eat, just pull back the husks and use them for a
  kind of a handle, butter and enjoy.
  
  The salt water acts both to salt the ears and also to moisten them so
  the corn doesn't dry out and burn on the grill. I've done this on the
  small scale with just a few friends but I've also seen it done with a
  large group where all of the ears were soaking in a large plastic
  garbage can.
  
  Other ways to do this involve buttering the ear before grilling
  rather than soaking in the salt water and some people wrap them in
  foil rather than grilling them in the husks.

  Corn, of course, is not native to China, but this Chinese way of
  cooking it is delicious.
  
  IN A SMALL PAN, combine the butter, dark soy sauce, Sichuan
  peppercorn and chiles. Make a charcoal fire and, when the coals are
  ash white, grill the corn. Baste them with the soy butter and cook

      1    2 Cornish Hens, per person
           Fresh or thawed if frozen
      1 sm Jar of Lime Marmalade
           (recommend the British
           Versions)
      1    2 Habaneros,seeded and
           Julienned, the thinner the
           Better
      1    Stripped rind (Green part
           Only!) from a lime
           Olive oil
           Tequila, rum, sherry or
           -water-use only enough to
           -slightly dilute if glaze
           -is too thick.
 
  On a kettle type grill pile the readied coals about the side of the
  grill. Oil lightly the poultry and place in the middle of the grill
  with clear space about them. Cover the grill for 5 minutes and cook
  the poultry without the glaze. While they cook mix the marmalade,
  chile, lime spritz and liquid of choice. If you heat this up in
  microwave or on stovetop it will be easier to work with. Using
  basting brush to stir and apply with. Uncover the C.H.'s and baste
  with sauce. Continue to cover,grill-bake, uncover and baste, and
  repeat until the birds are done. I won't say a time since grills and
  conditions vary but only cook until done. If the glaze gets too brown
  or charred it does not taste as good, either, so definately watch
  this as it cooks. and as we say here in Kentucky 'cornish hens is
  jes' a lil' chicken' (for which we pay a premium price!). I would
  guess that this glaze would work well with almost any poultry except
  the stronger flavoured ones like mallard or turkey.
  
  This dish can be done in a 350 degree oven, too. Adios.

      1 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper

      1 sm Onion, halved and sl
           Salt & Pepper to tas
           Veg. shortening
 
  Marinating the Ribs:
  
  Place country pork rib slices in a large container, such as a
  tupperware-type with a tight-fitting lid, add all ingredients for
  marinade. Cover and shake vigorously to mix. Refrigerate, overnight
  best but a few hours at the least.  This is an adaptation to the
  class "Fireman's Field Days" marinade.
  
  Preparing the potatoes:
  
  Spread out two 3 ft. sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil, splic
  together to form one wide one.  Rub vegetable shortening on center
  2/3 of foil to prevent sticking. Slice potatoes, skin still on, onto
  foil food processor works wonders..).  Season potato slices with
  remainder ingredients, slice butter over top.
    Carefully draw sides of foil together and crimp (don't pull apart
  seam on bottom!) and then roll up ends.
  
  Cooking:
  
  Get grill hot, place foil potatoes over high heat and cook for to 20
  min., then move to low-heat area, upper shelf, or keep warm in oven.
  (Check potatoes by unrolling top a bit and they should be soft,
  bottom layer browned well.)
  
  Keeping grill hot, lay out pork slices from marinade and grill Adjust
  temp for flaming/burning, not letting them fire or char. Turn baste,
  letting marinade cook on top of meat before turning again. The egg
  congeals on the hot surface of the ribs and helps to coat the ribs
  Continue turning and basting every few minutes until all marinade is
  g approx. 30-40 minutes. Cut into thickest part of a slice and check
  fo doneness - there should be no pink.  The object of turning and
  basting to build up a coating of the cooked marinade on the meat,
  almost like crust. Meat will have a well-cooked appearance but should
  not be char black (don't let flames ignite marinade and burn it).
  
  Serve foil potatoes hot from foil (mmm, get the crispy ones on
  bottom, like potato chips!) and dive into the ribs. Add your favorite
  vegetable or corn on the cob for a great meal, any time of the year!

      Title: GRILLED DRIED BEEF (THIT BO KHO)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Lean bottom round or
           -sirloin, in one piece,
           -about 6 inches in
           Diameter
      2    Stalks fresh lemon grass,
           -or 2 tablespoons dried
           -lemon grass
      2 sm Red chile peppers, seeded
  2 1/2 tb Sugar or honey
      1 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      3 tb Light soy sauce
 
  Here's a Vietnamese version of beef "jerky" made with red chilies and
  honey or sugar that sounds like it's off in the direction of your
  Chinese Dried Fried Beef recipe.
  
  This Vietnamese-style "beef Jerky" is delicious served with drinks.
  The Vietnamese enjoy eating it as a snack with glutinous rice. It is
  also an ingredient in Green Papaya Salad.
  
  Cut the beef across the grain onto very thin 3 by 3 inch slices. If
  you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper
  half of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you are
  using dried lemon grass, soak in warm water for 1 hour. Drain and
  finely chop.
  
  Combine the chiles and sugar in a mortar and pestle and pound to a
  fine paste.  Add the chopped lemon grass, fish sauce and soy sauce
  and stir to blend. (If using a blender, combine all of these and
  blend to a very fine paste.) Spread the paste over the beef pieces to
  coat both sides. Let marinate for 30 minutes.
  
  Spread out each slice of marinated beef on a large, flat wire rack or
  baking sheet.  Let stand in the sun until both sides are completely
  dried, about 12 hours. (You can also place a rack on a jelly roll pan
  and let the beef dry in the refrigerator for 2 days.)
  
  Grill the beef over a medium charcoal fire or transfer the rack from
  the refrigerator to the middle of a preheated 400F oven and bake
  until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes.
  
  Serve with glutinous rice.
  
  NOTE:  After cooking, the meat may be kept for up to 1 week in a
  covered jar at room temperature.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: GRILLED EGGPLANT & BASIL VINAIGRETTE
 Categories: Vegetables, Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Firm Japanese eggplant
           Olive oil
           Salt and pepper
           Balsamic vinegar
      3    Garlic cloves, plump
           - thinly sliced
      1 c  Basil leaves (about)
           - torn into small pieces
 
  This is a dish whose flavors improve with time, so make it when you
  have your grill going anyway. Grill the eggplant when the coals are
  dying, assemble the recipe, and it will be ready for a meal the next
  day. WIPE EGGPLANTS AND SLICE lengthwise or diagonally into pieces a
  little less than 1/2-inch thick. Discard the end pieces that are
  mostly skin. Brush each piece on both sides with oil and grill over
  the coals. (You can also fry the eggplant slices instead of grilling
  them, or even broil them, if you prefer.) To make crisscross grill
  marks, turn each slice just once at a 45-degree angle. Cook on both
  sides until eggplant is nicely colored and tender. As you work, make
  a layer of cooked eggplant in a non-corrosive dish. Season with salt
  and freshly ground pepper, scatter garlic and basil leaves on top and
  splash a little vinegar over all. Add the next layer of eggplant and
  continue until everything is used. The warmth from the eggplant will
  bring out the flavors of the garlic and the basil. It will smell
  wonderful. Cover the dish and refrigerate for several hours or
  overnight. Bring to room temperature before serving. ---

           Pico de Gallo
           Guacamole
 
  * Marinate the steak in the lime juice overnight . Lemon will do but
  the
    taste is not the same. * Prepare a hot fire. * Chicken breast will
  also work with this recipe.
  
  Julienne the bell pepper. Trim the onion top and bottom. Slice the
  onion from pole to pole so that each piece is about 2" long. It makes
  it better to pack it in the tortillas. Place the steak on the grill
  directly over the hottest part of the fire. Turn after about 5
  minutes and grill until done (about another 5 minutes.) Remove the
  steak, slice it across the grain about 1/4" thick and wrap in foil to

      Title: GRILLED FILLET WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Beef Fillet; About 4 1/2
           Pounds
    1/2 c  Red Wine
    1/4 c  Oil
    1/4 c  Onion; MInced
      1 tb Herbes de Provence Or Other
           Herb Blend

MMMMM-----------------------MUSHROOM SAUCE----------------------------
      2 tb Butter Or Margarine
      2 tb Onion; Minced
      2    Cloves Garlic; Minced
      8 oz Fresh Mushrooms; Cleaned
           And Sliced
      1 ts Meat Glaze (Bovril); OR
      1 ts Broth Seasoning Mix
           Reserved Marinade For Fillet
           Red Wine Or Beef Broth; If
           Needed
 
  Buy a prime grade fillet, if possible, and trim it well. Fold and tie
  the tail to the meat to form a roast of uniform thickness (or have
  the butcher do it for you). Place the meat in a plastic bag. Mix the
  wine, oil, onion, and herbs, blending well.  Pour over the meat,
  close the bag tightly, and turn it to coat the meat with the
  marinade. Place the bag in a dish and marinate the meat for 2 hours
  at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.  Drain the
  meat, reserving the marinade. Grill the meat 4 inches above hot
  coals, turning to brown on all sides. This takes about 10 minutes of
  undivided attention so you can put out any flash fires. Add damp
  hickory chips or small hickory sticks. Move the meat to the edge of
  the grill or cover the grill and cook for 15 to 20 minutes longer for
  rare, 20 to 25 minutes for medium rare. Slice and serve with the
  mushroom sauce.
  
  MUSHROOM SAUCE:
  
  In a medium skillet, melt the butter and add the onion and garlic,
  cooking until the onion is tender but not browned. Add the mushrooms
  and cook, stirring gently now and then, until well saturated with the
  butter and most of the juices cooked from the mushrooms have
  evaporated. Stir in the meat glaze.  Add the reserved marinade and,
  if needed, a few tablespoons of wine or broth to make a light sauce.
  Serve with the grilled fillet.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Swordfish -- fresh
      1    Spray oil
 
  Swordfish comes with skin.  Try Ono, a Hawaiian fish (comes
  skinless). With fish at room temperature, lightly spray or brush with
  oil. (Do this away from grill to prevent any possibility of flameup.)
  On hot grill, cook fish for 5 minutes. Carefully turn over and
  continue cooking, allowing about 10 minutes altogether per inch
  thickness of fish. Check for doneness in thickest part of fish,
  carefully pulling apart and looking to see if flesh is opaque.
  Remember, fish will continue to cook a bit even after it is removed
  from heat. Remove any skin, if desired. Serve on top of Grilled
  Smashed Red Potatoes; top with Papaya, Pepper Relish.

  NOTES : If you use your own fresh fish in this recipe, aim for about
  2 oz. of cooked, boned and skinned fish per person -- if you want to
  keep the protein values in line. If you are purchasing fish, fattier
  fishes such as swordfish and salmon lend themselves to grilling
  better than lean fishes such as halibut and tuna. In either case,
  take care not to overcook; fish will become dry, even tough, when
  overdone, especially if lean. Recipe By : Jane Rubey, 1996,

      3    Garlic cloves
      1 ts Black peppercorns
      2 tb Chopped fresh coriander root
      1 sl Fresh ginger, quarter-sized

      4    Whole Trout
      1 lg Banana leaf
           -(or more if needed)
           Vegetable oil
           -(for oiling leaf)

MMMMM----------------------CHILE LIME SAUCE---------------------------
      3 sm Green serrano chiles
           - seeded and finely chopped
      3    Garlic cloves
      2 tb Fresh coriander leaves
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Fresh lime juice
    1/3 c  Chicken stock
 
  This recipe illustrates the popular use of banana leaves as a food
  wrapper in Asia. Aluminum foil works well as a substitute.
  
  IN A MINI-FOOD PROCESSOR, add the garlic, peppercorns, coriander root
  and ginger; process into a fine mince. Transfer into a mortar and
  pound into a smooth paste; add soy sauce and blend thoroughly. Clean
  fish and pat dry with paper towel. Rub garlic mixture over entire
  fish; set aside for 30 minutes. Choose a banana leaf about 6 inches
  longer and 3 times wider than the fish. Rinse leaf with cold water to
  clean. Plunge leaf into a pot of boiling water for a few seconds to
  soften. Wipe dry. Using a knife or scissors, remove the thick spine
  in the leaf. Place the leaf with its glossy side down on a work
  surface. (Use more leaves if needed.) Brush oil on the leaf where the
  fish will lie. Set the fish with the marinade on the oiled surface.
  Fold over the wide sides overlapping at the top and secure with
  toothpicks. Turn over package, fold over ends to enclose sides, and
  secure ends with toothpicks to make a neat parcel. Set packet about 3
  inches above medium-high heat coals and grill each side for 8 to 10
  minutes. NOTE: If using trout, marinate the 4 fish together. Wrap
  each 1 individually and reduce the grilling time to about 3 minutes
  on each side. Serves 4 as part of an Asian multicourse menu. Transfer
  to a serving plate. Open leaf and serve with accompanying sauce.
  
  CHILE LIME SAUCE: In a mortar or a mini-food processor, add the
  chiles, garlic, coriander leaves, sugar and salt; pound (or chop)
  into a smooth paste. Put chile mixture into a saucepan with lime
  juice and stock; bring ~--

      Title: GRILLED FISH TACOS
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  Recipe by: Rich McCormack <macknet@CTS.COM> Marinate shark or fish
  fillets (tuna, swordfish, halibut, mahi-mahi, or whatever) in lime
  juice and salsa picante (as "picante" as you wish) for about 30
  minutes. Grill the fillets on a charcoal, electric, or gas BBQ grill
  (or a ribbed cast iron "grilling" pan on a stove top), sprinkling
  both sides with Rich's pico de gallo spice mix (see above) during the
  grilling. The grill can be brushed with olive, corn, or peanut oil to
  keep the fish from sticking. When done, slice the fish into approx.
  1/2 inch slices and serve as above.
  
  To be honest, when I suggest fish tacos to visiting friends or
  relatives from out of the So. Calif. area, I usually get some sort of
  a response such as "you ain't gonna put no fish on MY taco." But
  those who try 'em usually like 'em...

    1/4 c  White distilled vinegar
           Salt and pepper
    3/4 lb Fresh tomatillos *
      2 tb Salad oil
      1    Onion, cut into 1/2" slices
  1 1/2 lb Firm-fleshed skinned fish
           -fillets (lingcod, sea bass)
      4    Jalapeno chilies
      2 ts Lime juice
    3/4 c  Fresh cilantro leaves
      1    Clove garlic
     12    Warm corn or low-fat flour
           --tortillas (6-7 inch)
           Low-fat sour cream
           Lime wedges
 
  * Look for the small green tomatillos with papery husks in some
  supermarkets and Latino grocery stores. If unavailable, substitute
  small Roma tomatoes and add more lime juice to taste.
  
  Mix cabbage with vinegar and 3 tablespoons water.  Add salt and
  pepper to taste.  Cover and chill.
  
  Remove and discard husks from tomatillos; rinse tomatillos. Thread
  onto skewers.  Brush some of the oil lightly onto onion slices. Rinse
  fish and pat dry. Brush fish with remaining oil.
  
  Place tomatillos, onion, and chilies on a barbecue grill (high heat).
  Cook, turning as needed, until vegetables are browned, 8-10 mintues.
  Set aside to cool.
  
  Place fish on grill (med-high heat).  Cook, turning once, until fish
  is opaque but still moist-looking in thickest part (cut to test),
  10-14 minutes.
  
  Remove stems from chilies; remove seeds (if you want less heat). In a
  blender or food processor, whirl tomatillos, chilies, lime juice, 1/4
  c cilantro, and garlic until smooth. Chop onion. Add the chopped
  onion to salsa mixture, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour into small
  bowl.
  
  To assemble each taco, fill a tortilla with a little cabbage relish,
  a few chunks of fish, salsa, and sour cream. Add a squeeze of lime,
  and salt and pepper to taste.

  Cecila came up with this combination for actress Darryl Hannah, a
  vegetarian who cooks for meat eaters. The Philippines-inspired cold
  tomato and lime dressing is compatible with grilled fish or chicken
  as well as mushrooms.  To prevent the bamboo skewers from splintering
  in the heat of the fire, soak them in cold water for about half an
  hour and place them in the freezer for a few minutes before cooking.
  
  Combine all marinade ingredients in a glass or ceramic bowl. Add the
  mushrooms, toss to coat and set aside to marinate for 1 hour at room
  temperature.

      Title: GRILLED JERK CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Inner Beauty, or other
           -Caribbean hot sauce, OR
     10    Scotch bonnet chile; pureed
           -OR
     15    Chile, fresh; your favorite
      2 tb Rosemary, dried
      2 tb Parsley; chopped
      2 tb Basil, dried
      2 tb Thyme, dried
      2 tb Mustard seeds
      3    Scallions; finely chopped
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Black pepper
           Juice of 2 limes
    1/4 c  Mustard, cheap prepared
      2 tb Orange juice
      2 tb White vinegar
      6    Chicken leg quarter
 
  Combine all the rub ingredients in a food processor, or blender, and
  blend them into a paste, making sure that all the ingredients are
  fully integrated. The paste should be approximately the consistency
  of a thick tomato sauce. If it is too thick, thin it out with a
  little more white viegar.  Cover the paste and let it sit n the
  refrigerator for at least 2 hours for the flavors to blend together.
  Overnight is the ideal amount of time to give them to get acquainted.
  
  (**NOTE** If you want to avoid making a fresh batch every time you
  make this dish, you can multiply the amount of paste easily. Don't
  worry about it going bad, since it keeps almost indefinitely.)
  
  Rub the chicken leg quarters with paste and place them on the grill
  over very low heat.  If you have a covered cooker, put the coals to
  one side and the chicken on the other, and cover.
  
  Cook about 1 hour without a cover or 1/2 hour if covered. The key
  here is to use a very low heat.  You need to be patient and give
  yourself plenty of time. The chicken is technically done when the
  meat is opaque and the juices run clear.  However, the ideal is about
  10-15 minutes past that point, when the meat pulls away from the bone
  easily. It is very hard to overcook this. In fact you can only screw
  it up if you burn the paste by having the heat too high.  The longer
  the chicken stays on the grill, the more superior the smoky flavor.
  After cooking, separate the leg from the thigh by cutting at the
  natural joint between them. Serve one leg or thigh per person
  accompanied by a few spoonfuls of Banana-guava ketchup.
  
  Serves 4 as an entree or 6 as a light meal.

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           Grated zest of 1 orange
           Grated zest of 1 lime
      1 tb Fresh basil; minced OR

      1 lb Extra-large shrimp; about 18

MMMMM----------------------VEGETABLE SAUTE---------------------------
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      3 c  Vegetable; (use artichokes,

           -and zucchini) cut into
           -1/2-inch-wide sticks about
           -2 inches long
      1    Clove garlic; minced
           Salt and ground black pepper
      3 tb Balsamic vinegar

MMMMM------------------------CITRUS SAUCE-----------------------------
      1 tb Orange juice
      1 tb Grapefruit juice
      1 tb Lime juice
      2 tb Honey
      1 tb Dijon-style mustard
 
  For the marinade, combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add
  the shrimp and marinate for about 3 hours. (Note the recipe states to
  marinate at room temperature, but I would not leave it out for that
  amount of time. The safest thing to do is to marinate in the
  refrigerator.)
  
  When the marinating time is over, make the vegetable saute. In a
  saute pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the vegetables and
  garlic; saute for 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Season with salt
  and pepper. Add the balsamic vinegar and continue cooking for 1
  minute more.
  
  To make the citrus vinaigrette, combine all the ingredients in a
  mixing bowl.  Whisk to dissolve the honey.
  
  Remove the shrimp from the marinade and grill or broil for 2 minutes
  on each side.
  
  Divide the sauteed vegetables among 6 salad plates, put 3 shrimp on
  top of each, and pour on the citrus vinaigrette.

      1 c  Poupon Mustard
      1 ea Rack of Lamb
      1 c  White wine
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Shallots (minced)
      2 tb Rosemary (crushed)
 
  Mix jelly and mustard in saucepan and simmer on stovetop for 5
  minutes to melt jelly. Remove lamb chops from rach and French cut,
  being careful not to remove the fat from the eye (the fat will
  protect the meat from burning on the grill). Allow sauce to cool
  completely. Submerge lamb chops in sauce and allow to marinade
  overnight (place in refrigerator). Grill over Hickory coals 4 to 5
  minutes (for medium to medium-rare), basting with sauce as it cooks.
  Turn once half-way through cooking time. Prepare garnish sauce by
  browning shallots in butter and stirring in the white wine and
  rosemary. Serve lamb with garnish sauce and grilled potatoes and
  vegtables. NOTE: The marinade sauce also goes well with other foods
  including mushrooms.

      Title: GRILLED LAMB CUTLETS WITH PEA-POD & BASIL PUR
 Categories: None
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Pea pods
      1 oz Butter
      2 oz Cream
      4    Lamb cutlets
      1    Clove Garlic
           Olive oil
           Salt and Pepper
           Handful of basil leaves
 
  Steam the pea pods until just tender and pass through a sieve. You can
  liquidise them, but I found it allowed too much of the fibre into the
  puree. Reheat the puree gently with the butter and the cream.
  
  cut the garlic clove in two and rub over the surface of the meat.
  Brush the olive oil over the meat and season well with salt and
  pepper. Grill for a few minutes each side, depending on whether you
  like your lamb pink, or well done.
  
  Roughly chop the basil leaves with a sharp knife and stir into the
  puree off the heat, season with salt and pepper and serve with the
  meat.

      Title: GRILLED LOIN OF PORK WITH TART CHERRY SAUCE
 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      4 lb Boneless pork loin roast,
           -fat trimmed
           Salt
           Pepper
      1 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Orange juice
      3 tb Chopped shallots or onions
      1    Clove garlic, minced
    1/4 ts Minced ginger root
    1/8 ts Ground allspice
    1/8 ts Pepper
      3 tb Cornstarch
    1/3 c  Cold water
      1 lb Fresh or frozen cherries
    1/4    To 1/3 cup NutraSweet
           -Spoonful
 
  Dunno how you feel about NutriSweet and such ilk, but I'm posting a
  bunch of stuff from NutriSweets cookbook. Some of it looks right
  good. Tart cherries in a red wine sauce are the perfect complement to
  roast pork, while they give a dinnertime favorite new taste appeal.
  
  Lightly sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper; place on rack in
  roasting pan.  Insert meat thermometer so tip is in center of meat.
  Roast at 325F until thermometer registers 170F, about 2 hours.
  
  Heat the wine, orange juice, shallots, garlic, ginger root, allspice
  and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to boiling in medium saucepan; reduce heat to
  low and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.
  
  Heat to boiling once more.  Mix cornstarch and cold water; stir into
  boiling mixture.  Boil, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir in
  cherries; cook over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat;
  cool for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in NutraSweet Spoonful. Slice pork and
  arrange on platter; serve with Cherry Sauce.
  
  NOTE:  Tart Cherry Sauce is also excellent served with venison or
  other game.
  
  Makes 12 servings.

      Title: GRILLED MARINATED SKIRT STEAK
 Categories: Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Cumin seeds
      4    Jalapeno peppers, halved and
           -seeded
      3    Cloves garlic
      4 ts Cracked black pepper
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Lime juice (from about 4
           -limes)
      2 c  Coarsely chopped cilantro
           -leaves and stems
      1 c  Olive oil
      3 lb Skirt steak, trimmed of
           -excess fat and cut into 6
           -pieces
           Avocado Corn Relish
     12    Flour tortillas, heated
 
  1. In a small, heavy frying pan, toast the cumin seeds over
  moderately high heat, shaking the pan, until fragrant, about 30
  seconds. Transfer the cumin seeds to a blender.
  
  2. Add the jalapenos, garlic, black pepper and salt to the blender and
  puree with the lime juice until the cumin seeds are finely ground.
  Then add the cilantro and oil and puree until smooth.
  
  3. Rub the meat all over with some of the marinade and roll each
  piece into a cylinder. Arrange the meat in a shallow glass dish or
  stainless-steel pan. Pour the remaining marinade over the meat. Cover
  and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. About 30 minutes
  before cooking, remove the meat from the refrigerator and unroll each
  steak.
  
  4. Light the grill or heat the broiler. Grill or broil the steaks for
  3 minutes. Turn the meat and cook to your taste, about 3 to 4 minutes
  longer for medium-rare. Transfer to a carving board and let rest in a
  warm spot for 5 minutes. Slice the steaks across the grain and on the
  diagonal. The slices should be about 1/4 inch thick. Serve with the
  Avocado Corn Relish and warm flour tortillas.
  
  Look for a robust red wine that won't be overwhelmed by the strong
  Southwestern flavors of this marinated steak with its spicy relish.
  Try a recent bottling of garnacha from Spain.

 Categories: Appetizers, Vegan
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2    Round melon
    1/4    Cucumber, peeled
      1 tb Fresh summer herbs
           -(finely chopped)
      2 tb Brown sugar
 
  A summery starter. Light and herby, this can be served either hot or
  cold. In the latter case the sugar will crystallize and harden,
  forming a coat over the fruit.
  
  Scoop out the melon flesh with a 'baller'. Dice the cucumber into
  similar-sized pieces. Mix the herbs with the two fruits inside the
  melon shell. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the top, and leave under a
  hot grill until the sugar melts.

      Title: GRILLED MERGUEZ WITH CILANTRO-LIME RELISH
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
  1 1/2 lb Merguez sausage, separated
           -into links
      1 c  Coarsely chopped cilantro
      2    Limes, juice only
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped
 
  The article says merguez is a spicy North African lamb sausage and
  that it is available in Middle Eastern markets. She doesn't offer a
  substitute, but I'd think chorizo or hot links might work alongside
  the other dishes.
  
  Grill sausages, turning several times to cook evenly, until they are
  slightly charred on the outside, still juicy on the inside.
  
  Meanwhile, combine cilantro, lime juice and garlic.
  
  Serve hot merguez with cilantro-lime relish on the side.

 Categories: Sausage, Lamb, Moroccan
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/3 lb Lean lamb, ground with
    2/3 lb Lamb, pork or beef fat
      2 tb Water
  1 1/2 tb Minced garlic
      2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Paprika
  1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
  1 1/2 ts Ground coriander
  1 1/4 ts Cinnamon
    3/4 ts Cayenne pepper
  1 1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
      2    Feet hog casing
      2 tb Olive oil; optional
      1 lg Green pepper; optional
      2 md Onions; optional
 
  Combine all ingredients except the olive oil and the three optional
  items in a large bowl and mix well. If making sausages, use the
  sausage attachment on a heavy-duty mixer, stuff the casings with the
  mixture and twist and tie to make eight 4-inch links. Or shape into
  eight 3-inch-long lozenges, slightly fatter in the middle, formed
  around metal skewers or into 8 patties.
  
  Preheat grill or broiler.
  
  If the sausages are in casings, prick with a fork 2 to 3 times and
  brush with oil. Grill or broil 3 to 4 minutes on each side until
  cooked through. For lozenges, brush with oil and cook 3 to 4 minutes
  on each side. For patties, brush with oil and grill 4 to 5 minutes on
  each side or saute over high heat.
  
  If desired, sausages may be threaded on skewers alternately with green
  pepper pieces and onion quarters before grilling. Makes 4 servings.

    1/4 c  Fine-ground white cornmeal
      3 tb Whole wheat flour
  2 1/4 ts Kosher salt
  2 1/2 c  Unbleached flour (to 3 1/2c)
      1 tb Extra-virgin olive oil

MMMMM-------------------------TOPPING #1------------------------------
      3 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
      2 tb Grated Bel Paese cheese
      3 tb Tomato sauce (to 4 tb)
      1    Red pepper, seeded/julienned
      5    Thin slices prosciutto

MMMMM-------------------------TOPPING #2------------------------------
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      2 tb Grated Bel Paese cheese
      4 tb Tomato sauce
      2 oz Fresh mozzarella *
      1    Fresh jalapeno pepper **
      2 tb Calmata olives pitted/sliced
 
  * sliced 1/8-inch thick
  
  ** seeded and chopped
  
  PREPARE THE DOUGH: Place warm water in a small bowl, add yeast and
  sugar, stir until dissolved; set aside for 5 minutes. Add cornmeal,
  whole wheat flour and salt, beat to combine. Gradually add white
  flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until dough is stiff. Transfer
  dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.
  
  Brush dough on all sides with olive oil and place in an oiled bowl.
  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until double in bulk, about
  1 hour. Punch dough down; if dough is sticky, knead in a small amount
  of flour. Makes enough dough for four 12-inch pizzas.
  
  BASIC GRILLING INSTRUCTIONS: Prepare a charcoal fire. When coals are
  medium-hot, flatten pizza dough on an oiled surface to form a 10-12
  inch round that is about 1/8-inch thick. Gently lift dough and drape
  over grill surface just above the coals. Within a minute the dough
  will cook and brown. As soon as the underside is crisp and grill
  marks appear, pull the dough off the grill with tongs and flip over
  to the edge of the grill, away from direct heat. Quickly brush cooked
  surface with olive oil, add toppings...
  
  TOPPING #1: PARMESAN, PEPPER, AND PROSCIUTTO Evenly distribute
  Parmesan and Bel Paese cheeses over surface of grilled and oiled
  pizza dough. Spoon tomato sauce over cheese. Scatter red pepper and
  prosciutto over sauce. Continue with final grilling instructions...
  
  TOPPING #2: TOMATO, OLIVE, JALAPENO AND MOZZARELLA TOPPING Evenly
  distribute garlic on grilled and oiled pizza dough. Sprinkle with
  cheese and spoon tomato sauce evenly over surface. Cover surface with
  mozzarella slices and scatter jalapeno peppers over surface. Continue
  with final grilling instructions...
  
  FINAL GRILLING INSTRUCTIONS Drizzle surface of pizza with 1-2
  tablespoons olive oil. Slide pizza back toward source of heat. Rotate
  frequently with tongs until underside is brown and topping is bubbly
  hot. Serve at once.

 Categories: Side dish, Italian, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Water
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Yellow cornmeal
      2 ts Olive oil
 
  Prepare Basic Polenta: 1. Bring the water and salt to a boil in a
  heavy saucepan. Lower the heat so the water is just simmering.
  
  2. Pour the cornmeal in a slow and steady stream into the water. Stir
  constantly until all the cornmeal is absorbed, about 3 minutes/
  
  3. Turn the heat to very low; stir with a wooden spoon every 2-3
  minutes. The polenta is done when it adheres to itself and pulls away
  from the sides of the pot, 20-25 minutes.
  
  Prepare Grilled Polenta:
  
  1. Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with oil or butter.
  
  2. Pour the polenta into the pan and allow it to cool and solidify at
  room temperature, about 30 minutes.
  
  3. Preheat the broiler. Remove the polenta from the pan and cut into
  3/4-inch slices. Place them on a greased heatproof dish. Brush both
  sides with the oil or melted butter and broil close to the heat for a
  few minutes on each side until the polenta is crusty, about 5
  minutes. Serve immediately.

  Lettuce: Slice the Pancetta as thin as possible on a meat slicer and
  wrap lettuce with it. Heat a heavy skillet with olive oil and let

  the garlic cloves. Reserve half of the oil in the pan. Preparation of
  the Porcini Mushrooms: Slice the cleaned mushrooms into thick slices.
  Season well and brush with olive oil. Grill well on both sides until

  size. Keep warm. Preparation of the Vinaigrette: Heat the oil from
  cooking the lettuce in a skillet, add leaves of oregano until they
  fry. Add brown chicken sauce, sherry vinegar, and olive oil. Serve

      1 lg Chopped onion
      4    Cloves garlic, chopped
    400 g  Peeled tomatoes with juice
      1 tb Lemon juice
           Salt and pepper to taste

      1 tb Finely chopped fresh mint
      4    Serving size pieces
           -rudderfish
 
  Good capers are essential to this dish. If possible, visit a deli
  whose owners are of Mediterranean extraction and buy bulk capers
  which have been packed in salt. Rinse them to remove the salt before
  using. If you have to use the more readily available capers bottled
  in a vinegar solution, blot them dry of vinegar before using.
  
  In a tablespoon of olive oil. gently fry a large onion, chopped. until
  transparent. Add 4 cloves of garlic, crushed or finely chopped, and
  cook for a minute or so longer, then add a 400 g tin of peeled
  tomatoes. chopped, together with their juice, 1 tablespoon lemon
  juice and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for about 20 minutes, then
  add 2 heaped tablespoons of capers, the zest of a small lemon and a
  tablespoon of finely chopped fresh mint. Simmer again until the sauce
  is thick. Meanwhile heat the grill to very hot, dip 4 serving-size
  pieces of rudderfish in olive oil and put them under the grill for
  3-5 minutes, turning once if using a conventional grill. You may not
  need to turn the fish at all if you have a fan assisted grill.
  
  Spoon the sauce onto warmed plates, add the fish and serve,
  preferably with good bread to ensure no sauce is wasted.

    1/2 c  Rum, dark
      1 ts Garlic cloves, crushed

  Peel mangoes and slice fruit away from central pit. Dice the mango
  fruit, red pepper, green pepper and onion. Combine all the remaining
  ingredients in a bowl. Mix lightly then add diced mango, pepper and
  onion. Mixture will keep in the refrigerator for three days.
  
  Peel the shrimp and make a 1/4-inch deep incision on the top of each
  one (the side without the feet) from tail to the head. Under cold,
  running water, open the incision and wash away any brownish-black
  waste matter.
  
  In a large stainless steel bowl, combine the lime juice, pineapple
  juice, rum, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Add he shrimp.
  Cover and refrigerate for 2-4 hours - no longer, or the shrimp will
  start to cook in the lime juice.
  
  Remove the shrimp from the marinade and discard the liquid. Run a
  skewer through each shrimp so that each is pierced in two places. Put
  the skewer through the tail area, then bend the shrimp over and put
  the skewer through the thick section in the upper body area.
  
  You should be able to fit 4 shrimp on a 6-inch skewer or 8 shrimp on
  a 10 inch skewer.
  
  If you are using wooden skewers, be careful not to leave any gaps
  between the shrimp, or the skewer will burn through. Place the
  skewered shrimp on a grill over medium-high heat.
  
  Grill for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until the shells turn
  bright red.
  
  The meat should be an even opaque white. Remove the shrimp from the
  grill ad serve on a bed of Mango-Lime relish.

      Title: GRILLED SALMON WITH LEMON & THYME
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      4 lb Salmon fillet; skinned
      3 tb Cognac
    1/4 c  Lemon peel; minced
      2 tb Shallot; minced
  1 1/2 tb Kosher salt
  1 1/2 tb Sugar, brown
      1 tb Thyme, fresh; minced
    3/4 ts Pepper
 
  Place salmon fillets on heavy large baking sheet.  Rub Cognac over
  both sides of fish.  Mix together all remaining ingredients in small
  bowl. Rub over both sides of fish. Cover with plastic wrap. Top with
  another baking sheet.  Weight with heavy object. Refrigerate at least
  6 hours or overnight.
  
  Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill fish until cooked through,
  about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to plates and serve.
  
  Note: Bon Appetit recommends a sturdy red wine, such as a Beaujolais
  from Moulin-a-Vent.  They also recommend serving with sauteed zuc-
  chini. You could also diagonally slice thickly some zucchini with
  peel left on and brush with butter, lemon and thyme mixture and grill
  next to the fish; a Griffo grill would help but if you sliced the
  zucchini thick enough and on a strong enough diagonal, I don't think
  you would have problems with it falling through the grill. Some fresh
  steamed green beans with butter and freshly ground pepper would also
  be good.

      1 c  Thinly sliced red onion
      1 c  Seasoned rice vinegar
           About 1/2 pound watercress

  Soak the onions about 15 minutes in cold water to cover. Drain and mix
  onions with rice vinegar.  Cut potatoes in quarters; add to onions.

  the course stems to make 1/2 cup (discard extras or save for other
  uses). Mix chopped stems on a large oval platter with potato salad
  alongside; cover and keep cool.
  
  Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Place, skin side down, on a piece of heavy
  foil. Cut foil to follow outlines of fish, leaving a 1-inch border.
  Crimp edges of foil to fit up against edge of fish. Mix soy sauce
  with brown sugar and brush onto the salmon fillet.
  
  Lay fish on center of grill, not over coals or flame. Cover barbecue
  (open vents for charcoal) and cook until fish is barely opaque in
  thickest part (cut to test), 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer fish to
  platter with salad. Add salt to taste.  Serve hot or cold.

      Title: GRILLED SHARK
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Filet of Shark
      1    Slice apple per filet
           Oil
           Spicy chutney of your choice
 
  * Get rather thick slices of Shark and use 1 per person. Slice the
  filet along the side to make a pocket. Slice the apple slice so you
  can put it in the pocket. Oil the filet with canola oil to keep it
  from sticking and season with salt and pepper (or any other seasoning
  you like. I like to use curry powder. ) Grill on moderate coals for
  about 10 minutes per side. As always check and adjust as required.
  Serve with a spicy dressing or chutney of your choice. Submitted By
