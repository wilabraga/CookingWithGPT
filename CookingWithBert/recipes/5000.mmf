      1 c  Brown Sugar; Packed
    1/4 c  Milk
      2 c  Confectioners' Sugar; Sifted
 
  Sift the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, blending
  well and set aside.  Place the vinegar in a measuring cup. Add enough
  milk to make 2/3 cup and set aside. Cream the shortening and sugar
  together, in a large mixing bowl, until light and fluffy, using an
  electric mixer set on medium speed. Add the eggs, one at a time,
  beating well after each addition.  Add the dry ingredients
  alternately with the milk mixture and bananas to the cream mixture,
  blending well after each addition, using low speed on the mixer. Stir
  in the walnuts and pour the batter into a greased 13 X 9 X 2-inch
  baking pan. Bake in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven for about 45
  minutes or until a cake tester or wooden pick inserted in the center
  comes out clean. Cool, in the pan, on a wire rack until cold to the
  touch, then frost.
  
  PENUCHE FROSTING:
  
  Heat the butter in a 2-quart saucepan, over medium heat, until
  bubbling but not browned.  Stir in the brown sugar. Cook, stirring
  constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil.  Reduce the heat to
  low and cook, stirring constantly, another 2 minutes.  Stir in the
  milk. Increase the heat to medium and cook until the mixture returns
  to a boil. Remove from the heat and cool to lukewarm.  When the
  mixture is luke warm, stir in the Confectioners' sugar and beat with
  a wooden spoon until well blended and thick enough to spread. If
  necessary, place the pan in a bowl of ice water and beat with a
  wooden spoon until the frosting reaches a spreading consistency.  If
  the frosting becomes too stiff, warm over low heat.

      Title: BANANA CARAMEL CUSTARD
 Categories: Custard, Dessert, Desserts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      2 md Slightly overripe bananas,
           Peeled and cut into pieces
      8 lg Eggs
      2 cn Evaporated milk,(12 oz each)
      2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
    1/4 ts Salt
           Strawberries(garnish);
           -optional
 
  Recipe by: Woman's Day Cookbook 1. Fill a roasting pan or a 13x9-inch
  baking dish half full of hot tap water and place on an oven rack in
  the center of the oven.  Heat the oven to 350F.
  
  2.  In a small heavy saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the sugar over medium
  heat for about 5 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally until the
  sugar has melted and turns golden brown. (Watch the sugar carefully
  after it liquefies.  If it gets too dark it will taste burned.)
  Immediately pour the mixture into a 9x5-inch loaf pan so the sugar
  covers the bottom of the pan completely.
  
  3.  In a large bowl, beat the banana and the remaining 3/4 cup sugar
  with an electric mixer on high speed until completely liquefied with
  no lumps. Beat in the eggs.
  
  4.  Add the evaporated milk, vanilla, nutmeg, and salt. Beat with a
  mixer on low speed or stir just until blended. Pour the mixture into
  the loaf pan. (Don't worry if the caramel cracks.)
  
  5.  Carefully place the baking pan in the center of the pan of hot
  water. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes to 20 minutes, or until a knife
  inserted near the center comes out clean and the top is browned.
  Remove the pan from the water and set on a wire wrack to cool
  completely. When cooled, cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.
  
  6.  To serve,  run a thin knife around the inside edges of the
  custard. Invert a serving plate over the pan. Invert the pan and
  plate together. Lift the pan and allow the syrup to runonto the
  plate. Serve right away or cover loosely with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut into 10 slices.

      Title: BANANA COCONUT CREAM PIE *JB
 Categories: Desserts, Pies
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
MMMMM-------------------------PIE SHELL------------------------------
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      3 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Double-acting baking powder
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Cold/unsalted butter, cut up
  3 1/2 c  Sweetened flaked coconut,
           -toasted
      1 lg Egg, beaten lightly
           Raw rice for weighting the
           -shell

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/3 c  Sugar
      3 tb Cornstarch
      3 lg Eggs
      2 c  Milk, scalded
      1 ts Coconut extract
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Malibu or other
           -coconut-flavored rum

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
           About 5 to 6 bananas
    1/3 c  Apple jelly
      1 c  Well-chilled heavy cream
 
  Make the shell: In a food processor or bowl combine well the flour,
  the sugar, the baking powder, and the salt, add the butter, and blend
  the mixture until it resembles fine meal. Stir in all but 1
  tablespoon of the coconut, reserving the remaining 1 tablespoon for
  garnish, and the egg, stirring until the mixture forms a dough. Knead
  the dough lightly on a floured surface several times to blend it well
  and press it onto the bottom and up the side of an 11-inch fluted
  tart pan with a removable bottom. Chill the shell for 30 minutes,
  line it with foil, and fill the foil with the rice. Bake the shell in
  the lower third of a preheated 375°F. oven for 10 minutes, remove the
  rice and foil carefully, and bake the shell for 5 to 10 minutes more,
  or until it is golden. Let the shell cool completely in the pan or a
  rack.
  
  Make the filling: In a heavy saucepan whisk together the sugar, the
  cornstarch, and the eggs, add the milk in a slow stream, whisking, and
  bring the mixture to a boil over moderate heat, whisking constantly.
  Simmer the pastry cream, whisking, for 2 minutes, transfer it to a
  bowl, and stir in the coconut extract, the vanilla, and the Malibu
  rum. Chill the pastry cream, its surface covered with plastic wrap,
  for 4 hours, or until it is cold. The pastry cream may be made 1 day
  in advance and kept covered and chilled.
  
  Slice thin on the diagonal enough of the bananas (about 2 1/2) to
  cover the bottom of the shell in one layer, arrange the slices in the
  shell, and cover them with the pastry cream, spreading it evenly.
  Slice thin on the diagonal the remaining bananas and arrange the
  slices decoratively over the pastry cream in solid layers, making
  each layer gradually smaller. In a small saucepan melt the apple
  jelly over moderate heat, while it is still warm brush it over the
  banana slices, coating them completely, and chill the tart for 1
  hour. The tart may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and
  kept covered loosely and chilled.
  
  Just before serving, in a chilled bowl beat the cream until it holds
  stiff peaks, transfer it to a pastry bag fitted with a medium star
  tip, and pipe it decoratively around the edge of the tart. Sprinkle
  the cream with the reserved 1 tablespoon coconut and remove the side
  of the pan.

    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Baking soda
      6 tb (3/4 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
      2 tb Honey
      2 tb Warm water
    2/3 c  (1 large) mashed banana
 
  "These flavorful crackers are an obvious choice for a breakfast
  snack. A wonderful fruit cobbler crust can be made by finely
  crumbling these crackers, moistening them with melted butter, and
  pressing them into a baking dish. 350~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the
  oven to 350~F.
  
  Combine the flour, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl or in the
  food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse
  meal. Add the banana and blend well.
  
  In a separate bowl, dissolve the honey in the warm water. Slowly add
  the sweetened water to the flour-banana mixture and blend to form a
  dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, at most 1/8 inch. With a cookie
  cutter or a small glass, cut into 2- to 2-1/2-inch circles. Arrange
  the circles on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
  
  Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake
  for 15 to 20 minutes, turning over once during baking. These crackers
  should be medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 60-70.

      Title: BANANA CRUNCH CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
 
  :          For The Topping-----
        1 c  Dried Banana Chips --
  :          unsalted but sweeten
        1 oz Unsalted Butter
      1/2 c  Light Brown Sugar --
  :          (packed)
      3/4 c  Pecans -- coarsely chopped
  :          For The Banana Cake-----
    1 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour --
  :          unbleached
      3/4 ts Baking Powder
      1/2 ts Salt
        1 ts Ground Cinnamon
        3 oz Unsalted Butter -- softened
        1 c  Sugar
        2 lg Eggs
        1 ts Vanilla Extract
        2 ts Dark Rum
      3/4 ts Baking Soda
      1/2 c  Sour Cream
    1 1/2 c  Mashed Bananas -- (about 3)
  
  * plus extra for pan.
  
  For the topping:  Put the banana chips between 2 pieces of wax paper
  and crush them into approximately 1/2-inch pieces with a rolling pin
  or the flat side of a meat pounder. You should have about 3/4 cup
  banana chips pieces.  Melt the butter and brown sugar in a small
  saucepan over medium heat.  Bring the mixture to a boil and cook for
  30 seconds, stirring constantly. Remove the pan from the heat and
  stir in the banana chips and chopped pecans until they are well
  coated with the brown sugar mixture. Set aside.
  
  Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to
  325 F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 2-inch deep, 9-inch layer
  pan. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment or wax paper and
  butter the paper.
  
  For the cake:  Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon
  together. Set aside.  Put the 6 tablespoons softened butter in the
  large bowl of an electric mixer and beat on medium speed 15 seconds.
  Slowly add the sugar and beat 2 minutes.  The mixture will be thick.
  Add the eggs and beat for 1 minute.  Stop the mixer and scrape the
  bowl's sides down once during this beating.  Add the vanilla and rum.
  
  Gently stir the baking soda into the sour cream.  Stir the sour cream
  mixture into the mashed bananas.  The banana mixture will be lumpy.
  Decrease the mixer's speed to low and add the flour mixture and the
  banana mixture alternately, beginning and ending with the flour
  mixture (3 additions of flour, 2 of banana). Stop mixing as soon as
  the last addition of flour is incorporated.
  
  Spread half the batter in the prepared pan.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the
  topping evenly over the batter.  Spread the remaining batter evenly
  over the topping. Sprinkle the remaining banana crunch topping evenly
  over the batter.  Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick
  inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.
  Cool the cake in the pan on a wire cooling rack for about 2 hours.
  Use a small sharp knife to loosen the sides of the cake from the pan.
  Place a flat plate on top of the cake and invert the cake onto the
  plate. Carefully remove and discard the paper liner.  Place another
  flat plate or a moisture-resistant cardboard cake circle on the
  bottom of the cake and invert the cake. The cake is now right-side
  up.  Replace any of the topping that may have fallen off the top.
  
  To freeze:  Wrap the cooled cake tightly with plastic wrap then heavy
  aluminum foil.  Label with date and contents. Freeze up to 3 months.
  
  Serves 10.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Ripe Bananas
 
  Slice and dry full grown bananas. Use only the fruit that is full
  grown as green bananas contain too much starch. After drying, grind
  or pound in a mortar, then pass the powder through a sieve. This
  flour can be used in equal parts with regular flour in making
  desserts where a starchy substance is used.

    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
  1 1/2 c  Mashed bananas
 
  Recipe by: Rose Murray, The Christmas Cookbook Great Canadian Prepare
  two 2 Litre (9" x 5") loaf pans. Preheat oven to 300 F. In a large
  bowl combine the fruit, dates, pineapple and walnuts. Dredge them
  with 1/4 cup of the flour.  Sift the remaining flour together with
  the baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.
  Set aside. Cream the butter, add the sugar and beat until the mixture
  is light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Beat in the
  orange rind, orange juice and orange extract. Mash the bananas with a
  fork.  (A food processor will tend to liquefy the bananas and this
  will change the texture of the cake.) Alternately stir the bananas
  and the flour mixture into the creamed mixture. Stir in the floured
  fruit and nuts. Turn into the prepared pans and bake for 2 hours and
  15 minutes, or until  a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake
  comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 20 minutes, then turn out onto
  racks. Yields about 5 pounds of cake.

  banana mixture to the saucepan. Add the remaining 2/3 cup vinegar, 3
  cups water, brown sugar, salt and cayenne pepper.
  
  Bring the mixture in the saucepan to a boil over medium-high heat,
  stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and cook the ketchup,
  uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/4 hours. If the ketchup
  threatens to stick to the bottom of the pan at any point, add some of
  the remaining water, up to 1 cup.
  
  Add the corn syrup, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper and cloves to
  the ketchup.  Cook the ketchup over medium-low heat, stirring
  frequently, for 15 minutes longer, or until it is thick enough to
  coat a metal spoon. Stir in the rum.  Remove the ketchup from the
  heat and let it cool a few minutes.
  
  Force the ketchup through a fine sieve to strain it, pressing down
  hard on the solids.  Remove the ketchup from the heat and let it cool
  to room temperature. Store the banana ketchup, covered in the
  refrigerator for up to 1 month.
  
  Makes about 3 1/2 cups.

      Title: BANANA LOAF (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 md Ripe bananas, mashed
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 tb Ground flax seed, mixed with
      2 tb Water
    1/4 c  Applesauce
      1 c  Packed brown sugar
  1 1/2 c  Flour (use up to 1cup whole
           Wheat ..half WW and half
           White works best...all WW
           Doesn't cook quite right)
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  "Cream" applesauce and brown sugar, add flax mixture. Mash bananas and
  baking soda together, add to the other mixture. Mix dry ingredients
  together. Stir wet and dry to moisten. Use a 9 x 5 inch loaf ban
  (nonstick or sprayed with Pam). Cook at 350 (175C) for about an hour
  until it passes the toothpick test.
  
  Note: I usually add some vanilla as well. It's supposed to make 16
  servings, but they are paper thin slices--so I'd guess 8-10 real
  people servings. I haven't tried freezing it yet.

      Title: BANANA MALT
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    To 2 frozen very ripe
           Bananas
      1    To 2 Tbs Malt powder
      1 c  Rice Milk (maybe more?)
      1 ts Vanilla (optional)
 
  Break or slice the banana into small chunks and put in a blender. Add
  malt powder.  Add a small amount of the rice milk and start to blend.
  Add more rice milk as necessary until the banana goes from chunks to
  puree, then blend for another minute or two before adding the rest of
  the rice milk and optional vanilla.
  
  If you try to blend all the ingredients at once you're likely to end
  up with un-blended banana chunks.
  
  This recipe is a good way to use over-ripe bananas, which we peel and
  freeze when they've been on the counter for a bit too long.

    1/3 c  Granulated Sugar
 
  +------------------------------ FILLING
  ~-------------------------------- +------------------------------
  MERINGUE ~-------------------------------- To make pastry, combine
  flour, sugar and butter in a food processor. Process until the
  consistency of fine meal. Add beaten egg; continue to process just
  until dough starts to come together. Gather into a ball, wrap and
  refrigerate for one hour or place in freezer for 15 minutes to chill.
  Roll out dough on a floured surface or roll out between two sheets of
  plastic wrap to an 11-inch circle. Dough is sticky and falls apart
  easily; just patch together and fit into a nine-inch flan pan with
  removable bottom; trim edges. (If you don't have a flan pan, a pie
  plate can be used.) Chill for 30 minutes. Bake pastry at 375 degrees
  for 12 minutes until light golden in color. Thinly slice five of the
  bananas and arrange on bottom of pastry shell. Mash the remaining
  banana and combine with warm cream, 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch and
  vanilla. Pour over banana layer. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 - 40
  minutes or until filling is set. Let pie cool slightly. To make
  meringue, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form.
  Gradually beat in 1/3 cup sugar until meringue is stiff and glossy.
  Spread meringue over warm pie; bake at 350 degrees for 12 - 15
  minutes or until browned. Let cool; refrigerate until serving time.

      Title: BANANA PUDDING WITH MANDARINE CREAM
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4 lg Bananas
    200 g  Caster sugar
      6 tb Mandarine juice
      3 tb White rum
      4    Eggs, separated
      1 pn Salt
      3 tb Sugar
    210 ml Mandarine juice
 
  Loosely related to a dessert from the English-speaking islands of the
  West Indies, this makes a wonderful - and legal - winter fruit
  pudding. Despite its richness, it has next to no fat and, if you use
  eggs modified with omega 3 oil, it couldn't be more nutritionally
  sound.
  
  Mash 4 large bananas (if anything, slightly overripe) with 200 g
  caster sugar, 6 tablespoons mandarin juice and 3 tablespoons white
  rum. Separate 4 eggs and beat the whites with a pinch of salt until
  they stand in stiff peaks. Fold the whites through the banana mixture
  gently and turn the mixture into a serving dish or dishes. Chill for
  several hours until set.
  
  Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks with 3 tablespoons of sugar until thick
  and creamy. Tip the mixture into the top of a double boiler or a
  basin over simmering water, add 210 mL of mandarine juice and whisk
  over a gentle heat until it reaches coating consistency. Don't let it
  boil. Chill for several hours. Serve with the pudding.

      Title: BANANA SHORTCAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2    To 1 ripe banana
      1 ts To 2 ts lemon juice OR a
           -pinch of unbuffered,
           -corn-free vitamin C
           Crystals, to taste, optional
      2 sl Buckwheat Banana Bread (see
           -recipe)
 
  Servings: 1
  
  This Banana Shortcake makes a satisfying, whole breakfast - it's not a
  dessert shortcake.  Because the Banana Bread is made in advance - and
  probably frozen ~ the shortcake is quick and easy to put together. I
  (Marjorie Hurt Jones) sometimes serve it for "normal eating" house
  guests who devour every last crumb!
  
  Directions:
  
  Mash banana with a fork; whip until light and frothy. If you enjoy a
  little tang, add the lemon juice or the pinch of the vit C. Toast the
  bread lightly either in a toasster oven or in a dry frypan - homemade
  quickbreads don't do well in a traditional pop-up toasster.
  
  To assemble: Lay toasted bread on a plate; top with a dollop of
  masshed banana.
  
  Note:  If your Banana Bread is frozen be sure to take it out the
  evening before you want it for breakfast. Use a serrated bread knife
  for slicing.

      2 c  Peanut butter
      2 c  Ripe bananas

      Title: BANANA TEA LOAF
 Categories: Diabetic, Breadmaker
      Yield: 18 Servings
 
      2    Bananas; ripe, mashed
    1/2 c  Canola oil like Crisco;
      2 lg Eggs;
      2 tb Frozen orange/pineapp. conc.
  1 3/4 c  Flour;
      2 ts Baking powder;
    1/4 ts Baking soda;
    1/2 ts Orange peel;
           Cooking spray;
 
  Adapted from The Joslin Diabetes Gourmet Cookbook, 1993 which used 1
  large egg white plus 6 tbsp. egg substitute, 1/8 tsp almond extract,
  orange juice concentrate, 2 cups unbleached flour and no orange peel.
  
  Original nutritional info. 1/18 recipe = 1 bread, 1 fat Joslin
  Exchanges 122 calories, 2 grams protein, 14 grams carbohydrate, 6
  grams fat (44% of calories), trace cholesterol, 61 mg sodium, 105 mg
  potassium.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Line a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan with waxed paper
  and spray with cooking spray.
  
  In a large bowl, combine bananas, oil, beaten egg, juice concentrate
  and orange peel.  Stir dry ingredients together and then stir them
  into banana mixture until just blended.
  
  Spread the batter in the pan and bake for 45 minutes or until the top
  is lightly browned.  Cool in a pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a
  wire rack.  Slice the first sample while the loaf is still warm.
  Comment in the original recipe states that the well-wrapped loaf
  keeps in the refrigerator and freezes well. Slice is smaller than a
  slice of regular bread (about half size).
  
  Tested with changes noted by Elizabeth Rodier, Jan 1994. To cut down
  on cholesterol use 1 whole egg and 2 whites, or home made egg
  substitute.
  
  When comparing bread recipes, consider serving size as well as
  calories. Does the serving taste good alone or would I add 1 tsp
  margarine (1 fat)?
  
  1 tb peanut butter would add 1 fat exchange + 1 meat or 95 calories, 3
  grams carb. 4 grams protein, 8.2 grams fat, 98 mg sodium
  
  1 tb regular strawberry jam made of equal parts fruit and sugar would
  add 54 calories, 14 grams carbohydrate or 1 fruit exchange

      Title: BANANA-CHEESE EMPANADAS
 Categories: Side-dish, Spanish, Tex-mex, Fruit, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Unbleached white flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Water
           Medium banana, just ripe
    1/4 lb Jack or mild cheddar cheese*
      2 tb Butter
 
  *cut in small thin slices.
  
  Note: the empanadas may be sauted or baked. If you are going to bake
  them, preheat oven to 375F and butter a cookie sheet.
  
  1)Combine flour and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Make a well in the
  center. 2)Pour in the water and stir until reasonably well combined.
  Then turn out on a floured surface and knead until smooth (5
  minutes). 3)Divide the dough into 8 equal parts, and knead each one
  into a small ball. Set the balls aside. 4)Peel the banana and cut it
  laterally into quarters. Cut each quarter in half lengthwise. 5)Roll
  out each ball of dough into a circle approximately 5 inches in
  diameter. Place a couple of small cheese slices near the center, and
  cut a 1/8-inch piece of the banana into several small strips on top
  of the cheese. Lightly brush the edges of the dough with water, and
  fold the dough over the filling, as you would a turnover. Crimp the
  edges securely with a fork. Set the finished empanada aside and
  repeat until you have 8. 6)To Saute: for every four empanadas melt 1
  TB butter in heavy skillet and saute over medium heat for about 5
  minutes on each side..
  
  To Bake: arrange the empanadas on the buttered cookie sheet, making
  absolutely sure they are securely closed. (If cheese creeps out during
  baking, it will burn.) Brush the tops lightly with melted butter, and
  bake at 375F for 12 to 15 minutes.
  
  Serve hot.

      Title: BANANA/PINEAPPLE TROPICAL SORBET
 Categories: Low-fat, Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Pineapple
      2    Chopped bananas
      3 tb Sugar
      1 c  Plain nonfat yogurt
      1 tb Honey
 
  Because this sorbet is frozen in the pineapple shell, you must cut
  out the flesh according to the following special method. First, slice
  off the top, just at the point where the edges begin to straighten.
  Now stand the pineapple up on its bottom end. Insert a long,
  thin-bladed knife into the exposed flesh, next to the pineapple's
  outer skin. Push the knife in tin the entire length of the pineapple,
  stopping just above the bottom - CAREFUL - you don't want to
  penetrate through the bottom. Cut in a circle around the edge just
  inside the skin. You've now created a long cylinder of pineapple
  flesh that's connected to the shell only at the bottom.
  
  To separate the bottom of this fruit cylinder, insert the knife into
  the side of the pineapple, about 1 inch from the bottom. Without
  enlarging the hole that is the knife's entry point into the fruit,
  fan the blade back and forth, cutting through the inside fruit
  cylinder in a large "V". Repeat this procedure on the opposite side.
  Now the long, central p pineapple cylinder is free.
  
  Invert the pineapple over a bowl to catch the juice. Plunge a fork
  into the pineapple cylinder's top end and, with firm determination,
  pull it out into the bowl. Remove the tough central core of the fruit
  by cutting the cylinder into quarters and then trimming off the
  center strip of eac each piece. Remove any "eyes".
  
  Roughly chop the remaining pineapple flesh and put it into the bowl
  with the reserved juice. The rest is easier!!
  
  Puree pineapple flesh and juice with bananas in food processor,
  gradually adding the sugar, yogurt and honey. Transfer to ice cream
  maker and process according to directions. Scoop sorbet into hollowed
  out pineapple shell, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least
  an hour.
  
  To serve: Remove from freezer just before serving. Slice the
  pineapple from top to bottom into 6 wedges.
  
  Of course, one needn't go to all that trouble...but it's a lovely way
  to present the sorbet. If you don't want to do it, then skip all the
  hard part, and just chop up the pineapple flesh and go from there and
  serve directly out of the ice cream maker!! :)
  
  This will also get posted in the low fat topic, as it only has 1 gm

 Categories: Low fat, Desserts
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1 lg Or 1-2 small bananas per
           Person
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Calvados, grand marnier or
           Cointreau
      5 fl Oz orange juice
      2 tb Molasses sugar
      1    Egg
      4 oz Flour
     10 fl Oz lager beer
 
  Make pancakes with lager, flour and egg, and cook in the normal way
  (I used a cooking spray to grease a non-stick frying pan). Fold each
  pancake in half, and then in half again, so it forms a quarter-circle
  (if you're as bad at cooking pancakes as I am, they'll come out in
  bits anyway - if so, pretend it didn't happen!), and place them in a
  large flan dish.

      1 lg Or 1-2 small bananas per
           Person
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Calvados, grand marnier or
           Cointreau
      5 fl Oz orange juice
      2 tb Molasses sugar
      1    Egg
      4 oz Flour
     10 fl Oz lager beer
 
  Make pancakes with lager, flour and egg, and cook in the normal way
  (I used a cooking spray to grease a non-stick frying pan). Fold each
  pancake in half, and then in half again, so it forms a quarter-circle
  (if you're as bad at cooking pancakes as I am, they'll come out in
  bits anyway - if so, pretend it didn't happen!), and place them in a
  large flan dish.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Bananas
      3 tb Butter
      1 c  Sugar
      2 oz Rum
 
  Peel bananas, splitting lengthwise and cutting in halves. Place
  bananas in a buttered, shallow, oven-proof baking dish and dot with
  butter. Sprinkle sugar over bananas. Bake uncovered at 325'F for
  about 35 minutes. Set dish on stove, being careful to keep warm. Pour
  rum in a long-handled spoon, which has been warmed by dipping in
  boiling water. Set a match to the rum and as it flames pour over
  bananas. As it runs down in the dish, ladle it up and over the
  bananas until the flaming ceases. The secret of this dessert is to
  have all ingredients warm, otherwise it will not flame well.
  
  This old recipe, as good today as years ago, was brought to Louisiana
  by a distant relative of Empress Josephine, at whose table this was
  often served.

      Title: BANANAS FOSTER-NEW ORLEANS
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits, Cajun
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter (1/2 stick)
      1 c  Dark brown sugar
      2    Bananas
      2 oz Banana liqueur
      4 oz Dark rum
           Ground cinnamon
           Vanilla ice cream (opt)
 
  A quintessential New Orleans dessert, and a favorite among most
  locals. This dish cannot be prepared in the kitchen. It must be
  performed, in front of your guests. Use a chafing dish, and some kind
  of portable heat like Sterno. Don't be sloppy, and keep a fire
  extinguisher handy. There's no need to burn the house down just for
  dessert, but this really must be done right. I learned to cook this
  dish from Chef Joe Cahn at the New Orleans School of Cooking, and he
  spun dire tales of what befell those who dared sequester themselves
  in the kitchen when making Bananas Foster. Seriously, bad gris-gris
  will befall you if you deprive your guests of the spectacle. Plus,
  they'll talk for years about how cool you are to have made this for
  their dessert.
  
  First, you should make some preparations. Peel a thin strip of peel
  from the bananas, and use your knife to slice the banana crossways
  into coins. Then replace the banana peel so that it looks untouched
  (as best as you can, anyway). This way, you can pretend to "peel"
  your bananas, and dump them into the put already cut, as if by magic.
  Cheesy, you ask? Well, it still looks cool, particularly if you're
  really nonchalant when you do this in front of your guests. If you
  insist, you can slice the bananas the classical way, quartering them
  by slicing thm lengthwise and then in half. I still think the other
  way is cooler.
  
  Put your ground cinnamon into some kind of non-standard container, or
  even a little muslin bag, the better to "convince" your guests that
  it is, in fact, not cinnamon but voodoo dust, scraped from the tomb
  of Marie Laveau at midnight on All Soul's Day ... some kind of
  delightfully corny crap like that. Also, I recommend taking a
  cinnamon stick and grinding it fresh in a spice or coffee grinder
  instead of using pre-ground cinnamon. Sieve the result through a tea
  ball strainer to remove the larger pieces which won't grind finely.
  This will maximize the fresh, aromatic cinnamon flavor. If you use
  your coffee grinder, it'll also make your coffee taste great.
  
  Now, to business ...
  
  Melt the butter and add the brown sugar to form a creamy paste. Let
  this mixture caramelize over the heat for about 5 minutes. Stir in
  the banana liqueur and rum. Heat until the liquor is warmed, about
  three minutes. Add the bananas, cook for about 1 - 2 minutes, then
  ignite with a flourish. Here's the best way to do this:
  
  Using a long, bent-handled ladle, scoop up some of the warm liquor.
  Hold it a foot or two above the chafing dish and ignite the liquor in
  the ladle. VERY CAREFULLY, pour the liquor into the dish. A column of
  flame will descend from the ladle into the dish, which will ignite
  with a marvelous *poof*! Keep a pal nearby, subtly wielding a fire
  extinguisher. Try not to become a human torch in the process.
  
  Agitate to keep the flame burning, and add a few pinches of "voodoo
  dust" to the flame. The cinnamon will sparkle orange in the blue
  flame, and looks really neat.
  
  Let the flames go out. Serve over ice cream if you wish, but some
  hardcores like me like it just like it is. Yum.
  
  Variations: one may substitute any fruit for this dish that has a
  correspondingly flavored liqueur -- peaches, pears, whatever. Walt MM

  Source: Food & Wine - November 1996 Description: Crunch banana
  brittle tops a banana cream pie with
  :            chocolate and coconut.
  
  Preparing the Pastry: ==================== 1. In a bowl, combine the
  flour, sugar and salt. Cut in the shortening until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal. Add the water and stir just until the dough
  comes together. Shape into a disk, cover with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes or overnight.
  
  2. Preheat the oven to 375øF. On a floured surface, roll out the
  dough to an 11" round. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the
  overhang to 1/2", fold it under itself and crimp decoratively. Freeze
  until firm, about 10 minutes. Bake the pie shell for about 25 minutes
  at 375øF. for about 25 minutes or until golden. Let cool on a rack.
  
  Preparing the Filling: ===================== 3. In a small saucepan,
  heat the cream just until boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in
  the chocolate until melted. Transfer to a bowl and add the salt.
  Refrigerate, sitrring often, until cooled and thickened, about 45
  minutes. Arrange the banana pieces vertically on the pie shell in
  concentric circles. Pour the choclate over them and refrigerate until
  firm, about 2 hours.
  
  4. Meanwhile, heat the milk in a heavy saucepan. In a bowl, combine
  the sugar and cornstarch. Stir in the egg yolks, then whisk the
  mixture into the milk. Whisk over low heat until the custard thickens
  and almost boils, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, add the
  coconut and vanilla and let stand until cooled, stirring. Refrigerate
  until chilled, about 20 minutes.
  
  5. Spread the coconut custard over the pie and refrigerate until firm,
  about 2 hours. Just before serving, arrange the Banana Brittle over
  the top of the pie.
  
  BANANA BRITTLE: ============== This sweet, crunch brittle makes a fun
  snack on its own or a clever decoration for sundaes, cakes and pies.
  
  Preheat oven to 350øF. On a large baking sheet, melt the butter in
  the oil. Spread to coat the pan evenly and sprinkle with 3 Tb. of the
  sugar. Cover with the banana slices in a slightly overlapping layer.
  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 Tb.sugar, the cinnamon and peanuts.
  
  Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the slices around the edge are
  crisp and golden. Let cool slightly so they firm up. Transfer the
  browned slices to a plate and bake the remaining slices for about 3
  minutes or until browned.
  
  (MAKE AHEAD): The brittle can be wrapped in wax paper and kept in an
  air-tight container for up to 5 days.

 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Ethnic, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 ts Tumeric
    1/2 lb Potatoes; 225 g. chopped in
           -small cubes
      1 ea Onion; finely chopped
      1 ea Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Cumin, ground
    1/2 ts Ginger, ground
    1/4 ts Chili powder
      4 ea Tomatoes; chopped
      1 c  Cabbage; finely sliced

           Oil
           -Salt
 
  "In Bangladesh, cabbage is usually available in the market during the
  winter season, as are tomatoes, peas and carrots. So this dish appears
  quite frequently at Bengali dinner tables during the winter. In the
  markets where such vegetables are available year round, banda is a
  popular standard." Meghna Guharthakurta, Dhaka, Bangladesh
  
  Start by heating the oil in a heavy pan and put in the tumeric and
  some salt. Fry for a few seconds and then add the cubed potatoes,
  turning frequently so that they turn yellow from the tumeric. Cook
  them for 5-10 minutes (they will complete their cooking later) and
  remove them from the oil and set aside. Adding more oil if necessary,
  now saute the onion slices until they are soft and transparent. Then
  add the bay leaf, cumin, ginger and chili powder. Stir well and put
  in the tomatoes. When they have begun to break down, add the cabbage
  bit by bit, stirring it in well so that it is sauteed in the spices.
  Cover and cook gently for 3-5 minutes. Finally put in the peas and
  semi-fried potatoes and seasoning.Mix well, replace the cover and
  continue to cook for 5-10 minutes or until potatoes are ready.

      Title: BANGIN' BART
 Categories: Entrees, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lg Eggplants, unpeeled,
           -diced
      2 lg Tomatoes, diced
      2 lg Onions, finely chopped
      2 tb Oil (or clarified
           -butter)
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Black pepper
 
  In a large frying pan, saute the onion in the oil until it is
  translucent. Add the spices and stir for 1 minute. Add the eggplant
  and tomato, stir well and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until
  vegetables are mushy (about 1/2 hour).
  
  Remove the lid and continue cooking until most of the liquid
  evaporates (about 15 minutes). The finished dish should be thick
  enough that you could use it as a dip.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indian eggplant, onion and tomato casserole -- This is an Indian
  dish, called Baigan Bartha in Hindi.  We make it a lot and call it
  "Bangin' Bart." It is eggplant, onions and tomatoes, but not in the
  usual way.
  
  In this recipe, the vegetables are cooked to mush, with only a small
  amount of tomato, just enough to flavor it. Yield: serves 6-8.
  
  *  I don't make this with any spices but salt and pepper. The genuine
  Indian version of the recipe adds various Indian spices; try about 1
  t of fresh ginger, about 1/2 t of turmeric, about 1/2 t of cayenne,
  and about 1 t of garam masala for a more authentic Indian flavor.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  three hours. Rub the beans to remove the hulls, rinse well and pour
  them off. Cook with 1 cup water until the  beans are done and the
  water evaporated. Stir cooked mung beans with a wooden or plastic
  spatula until it is smooth. Dissolve sugar in coconut milk over low
  heat. Pour mixture into mung bean puree. Add vanilla. Stir well to
  make a smooth mixture. Pour into a preheated greased baking dish 8
  inches in diameter and 3 inches in depth. Bake uncovered in a medium
  oven (350^F) until golden brown (about 1 hour). NOTES: Cooked mung
  beans, sugar, cornstarch, coconut and vanilla can be mixed in a
  blender. After mixing, bake as indicated above. Source: Vietnamese

      Title: BANH DUA CA RA MEN (COCONUT FLAN WITH CARAMEL
 Categories: Vietnam, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Dessert
 
MMMMM--------------------------CARAMEL-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Hot water

MMMMM--------------------------CUSTARD-------------------------------
      1 c  Fresh or canned coconut milk
      1 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  This is the ultimate coconut dessert++an adaptation of the classic
  "Creme renversee", or "Flan au caramel". The technique used is
  distinctly French but the flavors are all Vietnamese.
  
  This custard is at its best when prepared a day in advance and
  refrigerated so the flavors can mellow. If you just can't wait, you
  might try the Vietnamese method of rapid cooling for dishes such as
  this: place a small scoop of shaved ice on top of each custard before
  serving!
  
  Preheat the oven to 325F.
  
  Make the caramel:  Cook the sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low
  heat, swirling the pan constantly, until brown. Stir the hot water
  into the caramel, being careful to guard against splattering (the
  mixture will bubble vigorously).  Boil the mixture, swirling the pan
  occasionally, until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, about 2
  minutes.
  
  Pour the caramel syrup into a 1-quart souffle dish or five 4-ounce
  ramekins.  Tilt the molds to coat all of the surfaces with caramel.
  
  Make the custard:  Combine the coconut milk, milk and sugar in a
  medium saucepan over low heat.  Scald until the sugar dissolves
  completely. Remove from heat.
  
  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla. Gradually whisk the hot
  coconut milk mixture into the eggs, blending thoroughly.
  
  Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl. Carefully pour
  into the caramel-lined souffle dish or ramekins.
  
  Line a large roasting pan with 2 layers of paper towels (see Note).
  Put the souffle dish in the roasting pan and add hot water to reach
  halfway up the side of the dish.  Bake in the center of the oven for
  50 minutes (30 minutes if using ramekins), or until a knife inserted
  in the center comes out clean.  Be careful not to let the water boil;
  do not disturb the custard while baking.  This is the only "secret"
  to producing a smooth and velvety custard.
  
  Remove the souffle dish immediately from the hot water. Allow to cool
  in a cold-water bath.  Chill thoroughly.
  
  To serve, run a knife around the edge of the custard and turn out onto
  dessert plates.  Serve with shaved ice or whipped cream, if desired.
  
  Note:  The paper towels in the roasting pan serve a twofold purpose:
  First, they allow the hot water to circulate under the souffle dish
  while baking to distribute the heat evenly; second, if using small
  ramekins, it stabilizes them and keeps them from moving around while
  baking.
  
  Yield: 5 servings.

  "Bannock, a simple type of scone was cooked in pioneer days over open
  fires. Variations in flours and the additional of dried or fresh
  fruit make this bread the simple choice of Canadian campers even
  today. Oven baking has become an acceptable alternative to the cast
  iron frypan. McKelvie's restaurant in Halifax serves an oatmeal
  version similar to this one. For plain bannock, omit rolled oats and
  increase the all purpose flour to 1 cup.... One of the earliest quick
  breads, bannock was as simple as flour, salt, a bit of fat (often
  bacon grease) and water. In gold rush days, dough was mixed right in
  the prospector's flour bag and cooked in a frypan over an open fire.
   Indians wrapped a similar dough around sticks driven into the ground
  beside their camp fire, baking it along with freshly caught fish.
  Today's native _Fried Bread_ is like bannock and cooked in a skillet.
     Newfoundlander's _Damper Dogs_ are small rounds of dough cooked on
  the stove's dampers while _Toutons_ are similar bits of dough deep
  fried. At a promotional luncheon for the 1992 Inuit Circumpolar
  Conference, Eskimo Doughnuts, deep fried rings of bannock dough, were
  served. It is said that Inuit children prefer these "doughnuts" to
  sweet cookies.
     Red River settlers from Scotland made a frugal bannock with lots of
  flour, little sugar and drippings or lard. Now this same bread plays a
  prominent part in Winnipeg's own Folklorama Festival.
     At Expo '86 in Vancouver, buffalo on bannock buns was a popular
  item at the North West Territories ' restaurant. In many regions of
  Canada, whole wheat flour or wheat germ replaces part of the flour
  and cranberries or blueberries are sometimes added. A Saskatchewan
  firm markets a bannock mix, and recipe books from coast to coast
  upgrade bannock with butter, oatmeal, raisins, cornmeal and dried
  fruit."
  
  Stir together flours, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add melted
  butter, raisins (if using) and water, adding more water if needed to
  make sticky dough. With floured hands, pat into greased pie plate.
  Bake in 400F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until browned and tester
  comes out clean. Cut into wedges. SERVES:6 VARIATIONS: In place of

      1 ts Cornstarch
 
  1. Heat oil in pan. Dice onion, add to pan. Brown onions over high
  heat, add garlic, if desired. Stir as needed, so the onion doesn't
  burn. When onion turns clear, add the following and quickly stir in
  vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses and mustard. When these have
  mulled together, stir in catsup and cold water with cornstarch
  stirred in.
  2. Simmer sauce over low heat, for at least ten minutes. Take care it
  doesn't burn. More water can be added, to thin, or to make more
  sauce. The corn starch will thicken the sauce as it simmers.
  3. This sauce can be used as a marinade for beef, pork or chicken.
  Remove meat from sauce to BBQ, or bake in sauce in oven at 350'F.
  Usually marinade enough chicken for 6-8 people in half of this recipe
  and freeze the other half of the sauce, for another time.

 Categories: Breads, Ethnic

      6 oz Dried fruit
      8 oz Dark brown sugar
    1/2 pt Strong hot tea
     10 oz Self-raising flour
      1    Egg
 
  This is Wales' traditional rich fruit bread.  South Wales makes it
  with baking powder; Northerners prefer yeast as the raising agent.
  Either way it's delicious.
  
  Soak the dried fruit and sugar overnight in the tea. You can use
  either fresh tea, or the cold dregs from the teapot (this gives a
  good strong colour).  Next day, sieve the flour and fold it it into
  the fruit. Mix in the lightly beaten egg.  Line a small loaf-tin with
  buttered paper then tip in the mixture, smoothing it well into the
  corners.
  
  Bake in a gentle oven at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for 1 1/2 hours.
  Cool and store for at least 2 days in a tin so that it matures moist
  and rich. Traditionalists say you should never butter the Bara Brith,
  but Dorothy says do, as it's lovely that way.

      1 pt Warm water
    1/2 ts Mixed spice
      2 lb Plain flour

      2    Eggs
 
  Oven: 450F, Gas Mark 8 for 15 minutes: 375F, Gas Mark 5 for 45
  minutes. Soak the fruit and candied peel in the water with the spice.
  Leave to steep in a warm place and use the warm spicy, strained water
  to mix the dough. Sift the flour and salt and rub in the lard; cream
  the yeast with the sugar and a little of the spiced water; mix this
  into the flour, together with the eggs and use enough of the water to
  give a firm, yet elastic dough. Knead well, leave to rise and knock
  back;  blend in the drained fruit and knead again. Shape the dough
  into loaves and set into greased 1 lb tins in a warm place to prove;
  bake, reducing the temperature after the first 15 minutes.
  Originally, in some recipies, the fruit content would have been fresh
  currants or blackberries. Bara Brith is often served as part of the
  traditional Welsh tea.  It can also be purchased at many of the small
  bakeries found throughout Wales. British Cookery (BTA/BFPC)

  Number of Servings:   6
  
  homemade garlic croutons (optional)
  
  Core the 5 medium tomatoes and coarsely chop them. Whiz the garlic in
  a blender or food processor, add the tomatoes and puree until smooth.
  Strain the puree into a large non-reactive bowl.
  
  Coarsely chop 1 of the cucumbers, 1/2 of the onion, and 1/2 of the
  green and red bell peppers.  Add the chopped vegetables to the
  processor (if using a blender, add 1/2 cup of the tomato or vegetable
  juice as well). Process until liquified; strain into the large bowl,
  pressing down with the back of a spoon to extract all liquid.
  
  Add to the bowl the remaining juice, olive oil, red wine vinegar,
  vodka or vermouth if using, lime juice, worcestershire, Tabasco,
  cayenne pepper, celery salt and pepper. Stir well. Cover and
  refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
  
  Finely dice the Roma tomatoes, remaining 1/2 onion, 1/2 green and red
  peppers and 1 cucumber.  Add the finly diced celery. Reserve,
  refrigerated in small mixing bowl.
  
  To serve, ladle soup into chilled individual bowls. Sprinkle with the
  chopped vegetables and croutons, if using.
  
  Note:  If this is just for the family, I toss all of the diced
  vegetables right into the soup as it's chilling (it doesn't last long
  enough for the veggies to get limp). And I might go to the trouble of
  making croutons, or maybe not.

      Title: BARB'S CHINA CHICKEN RICE
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------BARB DAY-------------------------------
      1    Chicken breast; boned,
           - skinned cut in bite-size
           -pieces
      1 sl Ginger; fresh, diced
           -fine
      1    Garlic clove; pressed
      2 tb Soy sauce
  1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Canola oil
    1/2 c  Onion; chopped
      4    Mushrooms; fresh, diced fine
      2    Zucchini; cut into cubes
      1 tb Cilantro; fresh, chopped
           - fine
      1 c  Rice; cooked
    3/4 c  Chicken broth; or as needed
    1/4 c  Slivered almonds
           Soy sauce; to taste
 
    Place chicken pieces in a bowl with the garlic, ginger, sesame oil,
  and 2 tablespoons soy sauce. stir to coat and let stand while
  preparing the remaining vegetables.
    Put the canola oil into a medium sized skillet (or wok). Saute the
  onions until they are limp.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they
  give up their juice. Remove the vegetables and reserve.
    Put the chicken and it's spices in the skillet, being careful to
  drain most of the liquid and cook until it it cooked through and
  slightly browned. Add the zucchini and cilantro, and stir fry 3
  minutes. Add the rice, the reserved vegetables and enough of the
  chicken stock to keep the rice from sticking.
    Cook only briefly to allow everything to heat through. Add the
  almonds and serve immediately.
    Note:  This is a dish I often make when I have leftover rice, and I
  very often use up different cooked vegetables in this dish. With
  cooked vegetables, simply cut them into small cubes, or julienne and
  add them just early enough so that they will be well heated. Try not
  to use vegetables that will become mushy with the heating, you will
  want them to still be tender-crisp. We often use carrots, broccoli,
  even spinach. If you are having Denise Bradshaw over to dinner, throw
  in a few peas.

     12 oz Jar creamy peanut butter
    2/3 c  Softened margarine
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 lb Confectioner's sugar
      6 oz Package semi-sweet chocolate

  Mix together.  Use hands to make into smooth 1 inch balls. Chill. With
  toothpick, dip all but the very top of balls into melted warm

      Title: BARB'S POTATO SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------BARB DAY-------------------------------
      4 sl Bacon; diced
      1 lg Onion; diced (See note)
      2 tb Butter
  1 1/2 c  Cabbage; chopped
     12 oz Chicken broth
      3 lg Potatoes; peeled, diced
           -Salt and pepper to taste
      1 c  Egg noodles
      2 c  Milk
      1 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Butter
 
   Note: I like to prepare onion by placing it in a covered vessel and
  placing it in the microwave on high, (skin on) for about 5 minutes.
  When the onion is done, the skin can be slipped off easily, and the
  onion chopped.  This is equivalent to sauteeing to the point where
  the onion is translucent, but for this dish the onion still needs to
  be sauteed. Using this method cuts out the tears and most of the
  odor, not to mention, no use of fat! Cook the bacon in the butter
  until it is lightly browned, then add the onion and cook for a few
  minutes, until the onion just begins to brown. Add the cabbage, and
  cook until it is very limp. Now add the diced potatoes, and chicken
  stock. Salt and pepper to taste.
   Cover and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender. Add the
  noodles on top of the mixture, and cover again. Cook for about 6 to
  eight minutes, or until the noodles are almost done.
    Add the milk and cream, and the 2 tablespoons of butter, and correct
  seasonings. Stir and cover the pan again. Cook over low heat just
  until warmed through.
    Serving Note:  You might like a little crisp fried, crumbled bacon
  and/or chopped chives or green onion tops as a tasty garnish.

      Title: BARBACOA DE CABEZA
 Categories: Beef, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Cabeza, beef head
      4    Onions
           3heads garlic
      2 bn Cilantro
 
  corn or flour tortillas
  
  Before you actually get the cabeza (beef head), understand that it
  won't look very nice -in fact it will look pretty gruesome.
  Therefore, I suggest purchasing the thing the day you cook it.
  
  In the Rio Grande Valley, barbacoa de cabeza is traditionally eaten on
  Sunday mornings.
  
  Clean the cabeza, removing eyes, ears, etc.  Discard the tongue.
  Leaving it will impart an odd taste to the meat. Wrap the cabeza in a
  paper sack, along with onions, garlic, and cilantro. Wrap THAT in
  burlap.
  
  Dig a hole 2 feet deep and build a driftwood fire in it. Wait until
  the fire goes to coals, then cover them with ashes, followed by the
  cabeza, then about 2 inches of dry dirt or sand. Fill up the hole.
  Add 6 to 8 inches of dirt or sand over it.  Build a fire on top of
  the ground. Use slow-burining wood such as oak or mesquite.
  
  Leave the cabeza in the hole 12 to 18 hours.  For example, if you
  begin cooking it at 4:00 p.m., it should be ready by the next
  morning. Serve with tortillas.
  
  Serves one vanload.
  
  If you want to try barbacoa de cabeza at homne, try wrapping the
  cabeza in foil and bakinng it in an oven or over a charcoal grill.
  Using foil in place of the paper bag keeps the cabeza slightly
  moister while

      Title: BARBACOA MEXICANA (BARBECUE FROM MEXICO CITY)
 Categories: Mexican, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Lamb, cut into pieces *
           Maguey leaves
           Ingredients for Barbecue
           -Consomme
 
  * backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs, and head
  
  To further explore the international links of various cuisines, check
  out this one and remember a few months back when we were talking abou
  the Pacific Island custom of cooking in pits. I didn't realize that
  the Mexicans also had such a practice.  Here's a series of recipes
  revolving around Mexican Barbacoa or BBQ.
  
  To be very authentic, use a lamb which has been slaughtered the day
  before the cookout and hung overnight. On the day of the big event,
  the animal is split into sections:  backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs,
  and head.
  
  METHOD:
  
  We assume that no one would tackle this kind of barbecue without a
  large number of guests-the kind who really like to pitch in. So, the
  first thing to do is to set one group of your guests to digging a
  hole about four feet by two feet across.  Other members of the party
  can scout up kindling and others can be set to work cleaning each
  maguey leaf.
  
  Once the hole is dug, it is plastered with mud to keep the walls firm.
  Large porous stones should then be placed in the bottom of the pit
  (beware of little hard rocks; they'll split open). Over the stones
  put enough dry wood to fill the pit, then set fire to the wood and
  let it burn to the smokeless coal stage. While the fire is burning
  down, the maguey leaves should be toasted until limp, for this will
  enable them to release precious juices needed to season the meat.
  
  When the fire has burned down sufficiently, line the pit with the
  maguey leaves, making sure that all of the mud is covered so meat
  will not stick to pit.  The leaves should be suspended vertically,
  the tips overlapping all the way around and held down with stones for
  the moment.
  
  The next step is to lower a grate into the hole and on it place the
  casserole with soup ingredients.  On top of the uncovered casserole
  ingredients, arrange the lamb pieces, starting with the backbone,
  then the legs, shoulders, rib sections, and the head.  Do not salt
  meat before it is cooked, for this can toughen it.
  
  After meat is in the pit, fold the tips of the maguey leaves into the
  hole to cover the meat well.  Over this place a metal sheet to keep
  any earth from seeping into the pit and then seal the pit with a coat
  of fresh mud and build a large fire over the metal sheet and mud
  cover.
  
  Keep the fire blazing for 5 or 6 hours, depending upon the age of the
  meat. Open the pit, salt the meat before serving it, and accompany it
  with Salsa Borracha*.   The broth is served in small cups.

 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Frozen corn
           Canned Kidney beans
           Chopped cilantro
           Onions, chopped
           Balsamic Vinegar
           Lemon Juice
 
  My favorite is frozen corn added to a can of kidney beans, chopped
  cilantro, chopped onions, balsamic vinegar and some lemon juice. You
  can use your imagination after this point. For example, add some
  white beans and/or frozen green peas which have been just cooked
  slightly, about one minute.

      Title: BARBARA'S MILK CHOCOLATE BISCOTTI
 Categories: Cookies, Italian, Rcrockett
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Whole blanched almonds -- (7
           Ounces) skinned
      7 oz Milk chocolate
           (Heatter uses
           Hershey's Symphonybar)
  1 3/4 c  Sifted unbleached flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
           (Heatter uses
           Dutch-process cocoa)
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      4 lg Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Toast the almonds in a shallow pan in a preheated 350- degree oven
  for 12 to 15 minutes, until lightly colored, shaking the pan once or
  twice. You can tell when they are done by the strong smell of toasted
  almonds when you open the oven door. Set asid e to cool.
  
  Cut or break the chocolate into small pieces and place it in the bowl
  of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Let stand.
  
  Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cocoa and sugar. Add
  about 1 cup of the flour mixture to the chocolate. Process for about
  30 seconds, or until the chocolate is fine and powdery.
  
  In a large bowl, mix together the processed ingredients with the
  remaining sifted dry ingredients. Stir in the almonds.
  
  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the vanilla just to mix. With a
  large rubber or wooden spatula stir the egg mixture into the dry
  ingredients. You may think there is
  
  Now place two 20-inch lengths of plastic wrap on the work surface.
  
  To shape two loaves, spoon a strip of the dough down the middle of
  each piece of plastic wrap. Each strip should be 13 to 14 inches
  long. Flatten the tops. Lift the two long sidesof the plastic wrap
  (hold them together as close as hands, press on the plastic wrap to
  smooth the dough and shape it into an even strip 14 to 15 inches
  long, 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide and 3/4 inch thick (no thicker), with
  squared ends. If the strips of dough are t hicker than they should
  be, the baked strips will not slice neatly.
  
  Transfer to a cookie sheet and place in the freezer for about 2 hours
  (or as much longer as you wish), until firm enough to retain the log
  shape when the plastic wrap is removed.
  
  To bake, adjust two racks to divide the oven into thirds. Preheat
  oven to 300 degrees. Line two large cookie sheets with baking
  parchment or aluminum foil, shiny-side up.
  
  To transfer the frozen dough to the sheets (the dough may still be a
  bit sticky; if so, it is okay ), open the two long sides of plastic
  wrap on top of one strip of dough and turn the dough upside down on
  the lined sheet, placing it diagonally on the sheet. Slowly peel off
  the plastic wrap. Repeat with the second strip and the second sheet.
  
  Bake the strips in the preheated oven for 1 hour, reversing the
  sheets top to bottom and front to back once during baking to ensure
  even baking. During baking the strips will spread out (7 to 8 inches
  wide).
  
  After 1 hour of baking, reduce the oven temperature to 275 degrees and
  remove the sheets from the oven. Immediately, with a wide metal
  spatula, release a strip from the parchment or foil and place it on a
  board. Repeat with the second strip.
  
  Use a pot holder or a folded towel to hold one of the hot strips in
  place, and use a serrated French bread knife to cut the strip
  crosswise into slices 1/2 to
      3/4    inch wide.
  
  Repeat with the second strip. Place the slices, standing upright, on
  unlined cookie sheets with a little space between them.
  
  Return to oven to bake at 275 degrees for 40 minutes, reversing the
  sheets top to bottom and front to back once during baking.
  
  Let cool and store in an airtight container.

  After mixing and being shaped, the dough has to spend about 2 hours

  bakings, which will total about 1 hour and 40 minutes.

 Categories: Side dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Dried navy beans
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2 md Onions, cut into small dice
      1 cn Italian plum tomatoes,
           -drained and coarsely
           -chopped (28 oz; reserve
           -1/2 cup juices)
    1/2 c  Ketchup
    1/4 c  Dark molasses
    1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 ts Dry mustard
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
 
  The secret to tender baked beans is to leave the salt out until they
  are finished cooking. For some reason, salt toughens them. To pamper
  your tummy, rinse off the beans when they are finished soaking in
  several changes of cold water. This recipe is easy to prepare ahead
  and cooks in only two hours.
  
  1. Place the beans in a bowl, cover with cold water and soak
  overnight. Drain and rinse beans very well under cold water.
  
  2. Place the beans in a large, heavy pot. Add enough water to cover
  the beans by 2". Bring water to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and
  cook for 45 minutes, or until beans are tender but not mushy. Skim
  off any foam that rises to the surface. Drain the beans.
  
  3. Place the oil in a large, heavy ovenproof casserole. Add the
  onions and wilt over medium-low heat until transluscent. Remove from
  heat and stir in the beans.
  
  4. Stir in the tomatoes and reserved juices along with all remaining
  ingredients except the salt and pepper.
  
  5. Bake, covered, for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 30 minutes
  more. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

      2 c  Dried great northern beans
      5 c  Water
      6 sl Bacon
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      2 cl Garlic crushed

      1 tb Prepared mustard
      1 tb Vinegar
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 ts Pepper
 
  When camping or planning a bean supper when no oven is available, try
  this version of baked beans, which is cooked over a camp fire or on a
  barbecue.
  
  Prepare beans using quick soak method. combine soaked and drained
  beans in a heavy saucepan with 5 cups water. In small skillet fry
  bacon until crisp. Drain and crumble. Saute onion and garlic in bacon
  drippings. add crumbled bacon , onion mixture and salt to beans.
  bring to boil; reduce heat. cover and simmer until tender,
  approximately 1 hour. drain beans reserving liquid. combine remaining
  ingredients with 1/2 cup bean liquid. add to beans mixing well. cover
  and simmer additional 30 minutes.
  
  Yield: 6 servings.
  
  To make beans darker, add 1-2 tsp browning sauce. Browning sauce may
  be used to darken any bean casserole...add a little at a time until
  desired colour is obtained.
  
  POINTER: At high altitudes, beans take longer to rehydrate and cook.
  cooking times will increase substantially at 3,500 feet or more,
  above sea level. Difficulty in cooking beans to desired tenderness
  within specified cooking times is usually caused by hard water. some
  cooks add a small amount of baking soda to counteract the problem,
  hovever, this is not recommented as it will destroy the thiamin and
  reduce the nutritional value. One solution to the problem is to use
  purified bottled drinking water for soaking and cooking.

      Title: BARBECUED BEEF SALAD WRAPPED IN RICE PAPER
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lb Boneless beef round (1 inch
           -thick)
      2    Stalks fresh lemongrass *
      2    Shallots
      3    Cloves of garlic
      1    Fresh serrano chili
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc
           -mam)
      1 tb Asian sesame oil
      1 tb Sesame seeds
      2 oz Dried rice stick noodles
           Boiling water
     12 lg Red lettuce leaves
      1 sm English cucumber, peeled and
           -julienned
     24    Fresh mint leaves
     36    Fresh coriander leaves, each
           -with a little stem
           Nuoc cham dipping sauce (see
           -below)
     12    (12-inch) dried rice-paper
           -circles
 
  * or 2 tablespoons dried lemongrass soaked in warm water for 1 hour
  
  This "fresh" Vietnamese spring roll is not fried, which makes it
  lighter and very refreshing. The filling, though herbaceous and
  hearty, is also light. Note that the beef needs to be marinated for
  at least
        3    hours before cooking.
  
  1. Cut the beef into 4- by 3/4-inch pieces. Slice each piece across
  the grain into 1/4-inch thick strips.
  
  2. Remove and discard the tough outer leaves of the lemongrass. Slice
  the tender white heart into 1-inch lengths and put them in a food
  processor with the shallots, garlic, chili and sugar; process into a
  paste. Transfer the paste to a bowl and mix in the fish sauce, sesame
  oil and sesame seeds. Add the beef slices, mix, and marinate for at
  least 3 hours or overnight.
  
  3. In a medium bowl, cover the rice stick noodles with boiling water;
  let stand 1 minute, then drain. Arrange the rice stick noodles,
  lettuce, cucumber strips, mint and coriander in separate piles on a
  platter, leaving space for the beef. Refrigerate.
  
  4. Just before serving, preheat a grilling rack over hot coals. Grill
  the beef strips for 30 seconds on each side, just until nicely
  seared. Or place the beef strips on the highest oven rack under a hot
  broiler and broil on each side until seared. Arrange the beef on the
  platter.
  
  5. Have a dish of dipping sauce and one or more wide bowls of warm
  water on the tables. Each guest dips a rice paper circle into a water
  bowl and immediately spreads it flat on a dinner plate or a damp
  towel. The circle will rehydrate and become pliable in a few seconds.
  It is then ready to be filled and rolled.
  
  6. To make a spring roll, lay a lettuce leaf on the bottom third of
  the moistened circle. Top it with 2 or 3 slices of beef, a large
  tablespoon of noodles, several strips of cucumber and a few leaves of
  mint and coriander. Fold the near edge of the paper over the filling,
  then roll up the paper around the filling, keeping it taut. Halfway
  through, fold one end over to enclose the filling; then continue
  rolling. Dip the open end of the roll into the sauce and eat it with
  the fingers. Serves 6.
  
  Note:  To make Vietnamese nuoc cham dipping sauce: Grind 4 garlic
  cloves, 2 fresh chilis (preferably serrano) and 2 tablespoons sugar
  into a paste in a mortar, blender or mini food processor. Stir in 6
  tablespoons Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam), 4 tablespoons fresh
  lime juice and 6 to 8 tablespoons water. Strain into a dipping bowl.

      Title: BARBECUED CHICKEN (S.DAVIS)
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      3 lb Chicken, cut into 8 pieces,
           -skin and fat removed, or:
      8    Skinless chicken breasts or
           -thighs
    1/3 c  Tomato ketchup
    1/4 c  Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Cider vinegar
      1 tb Unsulfured molasses
      1 ts Reduced-sodium soy sauce
      1 ts Chinese chili paste with
           -garlic
 
  Precooking the chicken in the microwave or gently poaching it on the
  stovetop before finishing it on the grill ensures that the meat is
  cooked through but the sauce is not charred If you like a hotter
  sauce, increase the amount of chili paste.
  
  Arrange chicken pieces in a micro-proof dish, with the thickest parts
  toward the outside of the dish. Cover with vented plastic wrap and
  microwave at HIGH (100%) 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender, turning
  pieces twice.
  
  Alternatively, in a wide sauce-pan, cover chicken with cold water and
  bring to a simmer, skimming off any froth. Simmer gently until
  chicken is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the grill or preheat the broiler. In a small bowl,
  whisk together remaining ingredients.
  
  With tongs, remove the chicken from the dish or sauce pan and brush
  both sides generously with barbecue sauce. Grill over medium-high
  heat or broil, basting with the barbecue sauce often, until the
  chicken is glazed on the outside and no longer pink inside, about
        5    minutes on each side.

 Categories: Seafood, Barbeque
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Chinese oyster sauce
      1 tb Hoisin sauce
      2 ts Ketchup
    1/2 ea Serrano chili, seeded and
           -finely chopped
     12 md To large fresh shiitake caps
           Olive oil
     12 ea Fairly large oysters,
           -shucked
 
  Preheaeet oven to 325. Combine the oyster sauce, hoisin sauce,
  ketchup and serrano chili.  Let the mixture sit for several minutes
  to let the serano flavor the sauce.  This step may be done well
  ahead. Make sure the stems are completely cut off the mushroom caps.
  Paint the caps with a little oil and a little of the sauce. Place
  them on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 2 minutes.
  While the caps are baking, roll the oysters in the rest of the sauce
  so that they are evenly coated. Remove the caps from the oven and
  place an oyster on each cap. Return them to the oven for about 6
  minutes. Remove and place on serving dishes and serve immediately.

      Title: BARBECUED PIG'S TAILS
 Categories: Mennonite, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Dozen pigs' tails
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Tomato sauce
    1/4 c  Tomato paste
    1/4 c  Brown sugar or syrup
           -[Maple, perchance? S.C.]
      2 tb Wine vinegar
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
           Juice of 1 lemon
      1    Clove garlic, finely chopped
      1 ts Dry mustard
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper to taste
    1/2 ts Rosemary (optional)
 
  We attribute this recipe to the Mennonite colony of Ontario. It's
  often served at picnics and is known as one of the favorite foods at
  stag parties.
  
  Prepare pigs' tails according to Step I in basic instructions; cut in
  3-inch pieces.  Place pigs' tails on a rack and bake in a 300F oven
  for 2 to 3 hours, until meat is tender and most of the fat has baked
  off. An alternate method to this is to simmer the pigs' tails in
  acidulated water for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Combine all other ingredients for barbecue sauce, coating tails well.
  Grill over hot charcoal, turning and basting, until crisp. If fresh
  rosemary is available, break off several branches, tie them together
  and use as a basting brush.  For barbecuing, we prefer leaving the
  tails uncut or halved so as to have fewer piece to constantly turn.
  
  Serve with traditional barbecue accompaniments such as corn-on-the-
  cob, French bread and green salad.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

      2 lb Boneless pork butt

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      2 tb Light soy sauce
      2 tb Chinese rice wine
           -or dry sherry
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Minced garlic
      1 tb Brown bean sauce

      1 ts 5-spice powder

MMMMM-----------------------BASTING LIQUID----------------------------
      3 tb Malt sugar or honey
      3 tb Boiling water
 
  CUT THE PIECE OF PORK BUTT in half. Cut the two halves into 3/4-inch
  strips. Put the strips in a bowl with the marinade and mix well to
  coat them thoroughly. Marinate at room temperature for 3 hours, or
  overnight in the refrigerator. Remove the pork from the marinade and
  baste the strips with the malt-sugar mixture. Use curved skewers
  (available in Chinese cookware shops and some restaurant- supply
  stores) to hang the meat from the top shelf of the oven over a large
  pan filled with water to a depth of 1/4 inch. Roast the pork at 350F
  for 45 minutes, basting occasionally with the malt sugar or honey.
  Increase the heat to 425F and roast for 20 minutes to finish the
  pork. When the pork is cool enough to handle, cut it into 1/2-inch
  slices. Arrange the pork slices on a platter. Serves 4 to 6 as a main
  course accompanied by vegetables, 8 to 10 as an appetizer.

      1 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Ground allspice

      6    Salmon fillets, 5 oz each
           Olive oil for the salmon

MMMMM--------------------FOR THE VINAIGRETTE-------------------------
      1 lb Organic field greens
  1 1/2 c  V8 or other vegetable juice
      1 tb Balsamic vinegar

  1 1/2 tb Barbecue rub
           -(reserved from above)
      4 tb Olive oil
 
  From Will Greenwood, not-quite White House chef.
  
  For the rub: Combine the chili, garlic and onion powders, the sugar,
  salt, allspice, cumin, white pepper and paprika in a food processor
  until thoroughly mixed. Sprinkle all but 1 1/2 tablespoons of the rub
  on all sides of the salmon. Let fillets marinate for 6 hours.
  
  To cook the salmon: Prepare a very hot grill. If you are using wood
  chips on the hot coals, first soak these in water so they will smoke
  more. Add soaked chips 5 minutes before starting the salmon.
  
  Rub the fillets with a thin film of olive oil. Grill them
  approximately 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness.
  
  For the field greens and vinaigrette: Clean and refresh the greens in
  cold water. Spin dry. Mix the vegetable juice, vinegar and tomato
  together with the reserved barbecue rub and olive oil. Toss with the
  greens.
  
  To serve: Divide greens among plates. Top each plate with a salmon
  fillet. Spoon the remaining vinaigrette in the bowl over the salmon.
  Serve hot.

      Title: BARBECUED SHORT RIBS
 Categories: Meats, Bar-b-q
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Short ribs (or chicken)
      2 c  Chicken broth
      2 c  :Water, or enough to
           -barely cover ribs
      1 tb Brown sugar
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
    1/4 c  Catsup
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 tb Dry mustard
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Chili powder
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  THE DAY BEFORE GRILLING THE RIBS, put the sugar and vinegar in a pot
  large enough to hold the ribs and place over medium heat on top of
  the stove. Cook until the vinegar reduces and forms a syrup with the
  sugar, about 8 minutes. Watch carefully, as the syrup will suddenly
  darken in color. Immediately add the broth, water, catsup, tomato
  paste, mustard, Worcestershire, cloves, chili powder and pepper and
  bring to a boil. Add the ribs and cook 20 minutes. (If using chicken,
  cook for 10 minutes.) Remove from heat, remove the ribs from the
  liquid and place covered in the refrigerator. Cook the liquid over
  medium heat until it becomes thick and syrupy. The next day, light a
  charcoal grill. Place the ribs on the grill so they are not directly
  over the coals and cover the grill so that smoke collects inside. If
  your grill does not have a cover, improvise one out of aluminium
  foil. Cook for 40 minutes, basting with barbecue sauce every 10
  minutes. When ribs are well heated, remove to a platter and serve.
  Offer any additional barbecue sauce on the side.

           -shrimp paste
      8    Ounces extra-thin rice
           -vermicelli
 
  The allied recipes for this rather complex operation follow in the
  next post. Although this dish can be baked in an oven, I strongly
  suggest you grill it over charcoal, for the result is far superior.
  The dish may be prepared over 2 consecutive days.  On day one,
  prepare the dipping sauce and condiments.  The Vegetable Platter and
  shrimp paste can be assembled the following day. Fresh sugar cane may
  be obtained at Caribbean markets; canned sugar cane is available at
  Asian grocery stores. Prepare the roasted rice powder, scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and roasted peanuts. Set aside. Shell and devein
  the shrimp. Sprinkle the salt over the shrimp and let stand for 20
  minutes. Rinse the shrimp thoroughly with cold water. Drain and
  squeeze between your hands to remove excess water. Dry thoroughly
  with paper towels.  Coarsely chop the shrimp. Boil the pork fat for
  10 minutes. Drain and finely dice. In a food processor, combine the
  shrimp, garlic, shallots and sugar. Process until the shrimp paste
  pulls away from the sides of the container, stopping as necessary to
  scrape down the sides. The paste should be very fine and sticky. Add
  the pork fat, roasted rice powder, fish sauce and black pepper to
  taste to the processor. Pulse briefly, only enough to blend all of
  the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate. Meanwhile, prepare the Peanut
  Sauce and Vegetable Platter. Cover the rice papers with a damp towel
  and a sheet of plastic wrap; keep at room temperature until needed.
  Peel the fresh sugar cane; cut crosswise into 4-inch sections. Split
  each section lengthwise into quarters. (if using canned sugar cane,
  split each section lengthwise in half only, then thread 2 pieces
  lengthwise onto a skewer.) Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a small
  bowl.  Oil your fingers. Pick up and mold about 2 tablespoons of the
  shrimp paste around and halfway down a piece of fresh sugar cane.
  Leave about 1 1/2 inches of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a
  handle. (If using canned sugar cane, there is no need to leave a
  handle. The skewers will serve as handles.) Press firmly so that the
  paste adheres to the cane. Proceed until you have used all the shrimp
  paste. Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the oven to broil.
  Meanwhile, steam the noodles, then garnish with the scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and ground roasted peanuts. Keep warm.  Pour the
  peanut sauce into individual bowls and place the Vegetable Platter
  and rice papers on the table. Grill the shrimp paste on the sugar
  cane over medium coals, turning frequently. Or Broil, on a baking
  sheet lined with foil, under the broiler, about 6 inches from the
  heat, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer to a
  warm platter. To serve, each diner dips a rice paper round in a bowl
  of warm water to make it pliable, then places the paper on a dinner
  plate. Different ingredients from the Vegetable Platter, some noodles
  and a piece of the shrimp paste, which has been removed from the
  sugar cane, are added. The rice paper is then roiled up to form a
  neat package.  The roll is dipped in the Peanut Sauce and eaten out
  of hand. The remaining sugar cane may be chewed. Note: If both types
  of sugar cane are unavailable, use skewers. Shape the shrimp paste
  into meatballs and thread 3 or 4 on each skewer. Yield: 4 to 6
  servings. From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart,

      Title: BARBECUED SQUID
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Squid, cut into rings
           Lemon-garlic butter [posted
           -in another post. S.C.]
 
  Serve this with a Thai sweet/hot chili sauce.  Had it like that in
  Bangkok and it was one of the best meals I had there.
  
  This recipe sounds too easy to be true.  It isn't.  As with any
  grilled seafood, the fresher the ingredients and the simpler the
  cooking, the better the end result. Barbecued squid and an anise
  flavored aperitif like Pernod, ricard, ouzo or raki, make a wonderful
  combination. Make a fire, preferably with firewood or Mexican
  charcoal, started from paper and kindling.  Skewer the squid.  When
  coals are red hot, barbecue the rings for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or
  until they are brown.
  
  Some recipes for grilled squid suggest marinating them. I omit this
  procedure because it adds flavor at the expense of softening the
  flesh. Serve hot with lemon-garlic butter.
  
  NOTE:  Commercial charcoal and lighter fluid are petroleum products.
  They impart an oily flavor to food. Hardwood, or Mexican charcoal, a
  commercial product, which is made by burning down mesquite, both give
  a nice flavor and are certainly less toxic than petrochemicals.
  Mexican charcoal is available in Northern California through Lazzari
  Fuel Company, San Francisco.

      Title: BARBECUED SQUID WITH HOT DIPPING SAUCE (SQUID
 Categories: Vietnamese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Squid, cut into rings
      1 c  Coconut milk
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
      6 tb Fish sauce
      3 tb Peanuts, finely chopped
           Juice of 1 lime
           Cayenne to taste
      1 ts Sugar
 
  No country of origin, but I'm betting on Vietnam this time, mainly
  from the dip.
  
  Coconut milk is easily made if you have a blender or food processor.
  
  Boil 1 1/2 cups water.  Pour it over 1 1/2 cups of fresh or dry grated
  coconut.  Beat it in the food processor or blender for at least 1
  minute. Strain it through a sieve or through cheesecloth. Marinate
  the squid for 1 hour in coconut milk to which you have added the
  garlic. Prepare the coals and skewer the squid.
  
  To make the dipping sauce which makes this dish so distinctive,
  combine the fish sauce, peanuts, sugar, lime juice and the cayenne.
  
  Grill the squid for about 3 minutes on one side.  When brown, turn
  over and barbecue 3 minutes more.
  
  Serve accompanied by the dipping sauce.
  
  This recipe will produce tasty grilled fish if you use firm varieties
  such as swordfish, sea bass or halibut, cutting the steaks or fillets
  into large squares.
  
  This dish serves 4 to 6 as part of a larger meal.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      9 lb To 13 lb turkey
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
      2 tb Chopped fresh sage, or:
      2 ts Dried sage, crushed
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary, or:
      2 ts Dried rosemary, crushed
      1 tb Chopped fresh thyme, or:
      1 ts Dried thyme, crushed
           Salt
           Cracked black pepper
 
  Use indirect heat, as explained in the recipe to cook a whole turkey
  or turkey breast. Allow 1 3/4 to 3 1/4 hours' cook- ing time,
  depending on the size of your turkey and heat of the coals.
  
  Prepare coals and grill.
  
  Remove neck and giblets from turkey. Rinse turkey under cold water;
  drain and pat dry with paper towels.
  
  Combine oil, herbs and seasonings in a small bowl. Generously brush on
  cavities and outer surface of turkey, reserv- ing some mixture to use
  as a baste.
  
  Pull turkey skin over the neck; secure with a skewer. Tuck wings
  under back and tie legs together with kitchen twine.
  
  Arrange medium-hot briquettes on two sides of a large metal or foil
  drip pan. Fill the pan halfway with hot tap water.
  
  Place turkey, breast side up, on grill, directly above the drip pan.
  Cover grill and cook turkey 11 to 15 minutes per pound, or until an
  instant-read meat thermometer registers 180 degrees F, basting
  occasionally with reserved herb mixture.
  
  Add a few briquettes to both sides of the fire every hour or as
  necessary to maintain a constant temperature.
  
  Garnish with additional fresh herbs, if desired.

  1 1/2 tb Light soy sauce
  1 1/2 tb Dry sherry
 
  This aromatic barbecued game hen can be easily served West- ern style
  with rice, cole slaw or a green salad. [But it would be better with
  Thai cucumber salad or Vietnamese carrot salad. Mmmm... S.C.] Halve
  the hens through the breast. Flatten with the palm of your hand. In a
  mortar or food processor, pound or mince garlic, shallots and sugar.
  Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Pour mixture over hens;
  marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight in refrigerator. Set hens,
  skin-side down, on grill and barbecue over medium coals for 15
  minutes. Turn and barbecue 15 minutes longer or until they are
  thoroughly cooked. Serve with Nuoc Cham dipping sauce.

 Categories: Rubs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 tb Cumin
      4 tb Thyme
      4 tb Garlic powder
      4 tb Black Pepper, freshly ground
      2 tb Cayenne Pepper

           -(optional)
 
  In a small bowl or glass jar with a lid, combine all the ingredients.
  Stri or shake to mix.  Use immediately or store in a cool, dark place
  for several months.
  
  This rub is pretty strong and so I do not recomment it for thin cuts
  (like ribs).  Bit it is swell on heavier cuts of meat such as beef
  round, prime rib, pork shoulders, and even the whole hog. With this
  recipes, you have enough for five shoulders or four hams. Best if you
  let the meat marinate, losely covered, in the refrigerator for a good
  twenth-four to forty-eight hours after being rubbed.

      Title: BARBEQUE PORK (FAMILY)
 Categories: Crockpot, Pork, Bar-b-q, Sandwiches, Family
      Yield: 32 Sandwiches
 
           -JEAN POLZIN
      4 lb Pork Butt or Shoulder Roast;
           -lean, boneless
      2 lg Spanish onions; (sweet)
      1 lg Bottle Kraft Honey BBQ Sauce
           -OR KC Masterpiece BBQ Sauce
      1 c  Ginger Ale (or Coke)
      4 pk Sandwich buns (8 per pkg.)
 
   Cut onions in half lengthwise, slice in 1/4" slices, halve the
  slices and separate into rings.  Trim all possible fat from roast and
  sprinkle with garlic salt and seasoned pepper. Place half the onions
  in crockpot, put in roast and top with rest of onions. Pour 1 cup of
  soda over all, cover and cook on LOW for 10 to 12 hours, or overnight
  until pork can be easily shredded with two forks.
   Remove pork from pot, shred in a bowl, removing all possible fat.
  Remove onions with slotted spoon and add to bowl. Discard juice in
  pot. Return onions and pork to pot, add BBQ sauce to all and mix.
  Continue to cook on LOW for 5 to 6 hours, adding more BBQ sauce as
  needed. Serve as sandwiches in buns.  (I use Pepperidge Fram Sandwich
  rolls).
   Leftovers may be cooled, made into  sandwiches, wrapped in heavy
  plastic wrap and frozen individually for later use. (I store them in
  the sandwich roll bags, 8 to a bag, sealed with the tab that came
  with the bag). They keep well and may be unwrapped, rewrapped in
  paper towels and heated in a microwave at 50% for a few minutes.
   NOTE:  Idea from Laurie Robinson (SNMJ29D) 01/14/93: "I made up a
  batch of BBQ pork but did not have enough rolls to freeze it with. I
  put globs of it on cookie sheets and froze them for a day. Then I put
  the globs into zip lock baggies and popped them in the freezer. I
  have used a glob on a baked potato for lunch (terrific), and sent
  some to work with my hubby with fresh rolls for the microwave.  These
  globs take very little space in the freezer and are very convenient
  for use." Wonderful idea!

 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Split fryer chicken
           White vinegar
      5 ts Salt
      2 ts Dry mustard
      2 ts Coarse grind garlic powder
      2 ts Cracked black pepper
      2 ts MSG
      1 ts Crushed thyme
      1 ts Celery salt
    1/2 ts Dried ground lemon peel
 
  I let the chicken stand in the fridge for a good hour before cooking
  on the Weber with a combination of charcoal and hickory (plain tap
  water in the drip pan.) I personally thought it was a tad bit on the
  salty side, but the family said it was fine. Must have been me. Next
  time I might back off some on the plain salt and the garlic powder
  and make up the difference with Lawry's (Coarse Ground with Parsley)
  Garlic Salt, which I happen to like a lot.

           None
 
  When I get invited to a bar-b-q, my favorite things to bring are
  portobello mushrooms and corn on the cob. They're easy to deal with.
  Marinate the portobellos in balsamic vinegar for an hour beforehand
  and then throw 'em on the grill like burgers.  I remove the stem and
  cut slits on the cap. In a group of non-vegetarians, the sight of 5"
  diam. mushrooms on the grill is a conversation-starter.

           SEE DIRECTIONS:
 
  Lay the rabbit in salt and water half an hour, scald with boiling
  water, wipe dry, grease with butter, and sprinkle with pepper and a
  little salt. Lay it on the gridiron, turning often so that it may
  cook through and through, without becoming hard and dry.  When brown,
  lay on a hot dish, butter plentifully on both sides, and add a little
  salt and pepper. Set in the oven, while preparing four teaspoonfuls
  of vinegar, one of made mustard, and one of currant jelly or brown
  sugar. Pour this over the rabbit, rubbing it in, then pour over the
  gravy and serve hot.

 Categories: Pork, Barbeque
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Cumin, ground
      2 tb Pepper, black, fresh ground
      2 tb Chili powder
      4 tb Paprika
      2 ea Racks of 3/down pork ribs**

MMMMM-----------------------BASTING SAUCE----------------------------
  1 3/4 c  Vinegar, white
      2 tb Hot pepper sauce
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Pepper, black, fresh ground
 
  The term "3/down" refers to the weight of the ribs. In this case, it
  is three pounds or less for each slab of 10 to 12 ribs.
  
  Combine salt, sugar, cumin, pepper, chili powder and paprika to make
  barbeque rub.  Rub ribs thoroughly with this mixture. Place ribs on
  baking sheets and cook in 180 degree oven for 3 hours. Do not turn;
  solow cooking infuses spices.
  
  Remove from oven.  (ribs may now be covered and refrigerated up to 2
  days before grilling)
  
  Use very low charcoal fire with rack set as high as possible. Grill
  ribs 5 minutes to 30 minutes per side, depending on heat and
  temperature of ribs. Ribs should have light outer crust and be heated
  throughout.
  
  If you prefer juicy ribs, coat with basting sauce just before
  removing from grill.  Otherwise serve dry with sauce on side. Remove
  ribs from grill, cut in between bones and serve.
  
  Note:  Recipe is easily halved or doubled.  Keep 2:1 proportion of
  sauce to rub.

      Title: BARKSHACK GINGER MEAD
 Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      7 lb Light honey
  1 1/2 lb Corn sugar
      1 oz To 6 oz fresh ginger root
  1 1/2 ts Gypsum
      3 ts Yeast nutrient OR...
    1/4 oz Yeast extract
    1/4 ts Irish moss powder
      1 lb To 6 lbs crushed fruit
      3 oz Lemongrass, or other spices
      1 pk Champagne yeast
    3/4 c  Corn sugar (bottling)
 
  Boil 1 1/2 gallons of water, the honey, corn sugar, grated ginger
  root, gypsum, citric acid, irish moss, and yeast nutrient for 15
  minutes. Turn the heat off. If you're going to add fruit (this is
  entirely optional, as are the spices) then fish out as much of the
  ginger root shavings as you can.  Then add your crushed fruit or
  concentrate and let it steep for 10-15 minutes.  Some ideas for fruit
  are:  Sour cherries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries,
  chokecherries, rhubarb, grapes, grape concentrate... go wild here.
  Pour the entire must (unsparged if fruit is added) into an open
  primary fermenter and add about 3 gallons of cold water.  When cooled
  to 70 to 78 degrees, hydrate and pitch your yeast. After the specific
  gravity has fallen to 1.020 or within 7 days, whichever comes first,
  rack the brew into a secondary fermenter. Leave the fruit behind.
  Age 1 to 1 1/2 months in the secondary fermenter. Bottle with 3/4
  cups priming sugar. If using spices or herbs as a flavoring, add them
  now by making a "tea" and adding them at bottling time. The flavors
  will be fresher and sharper. Some suggested spices are lemon grass,
  citrus peel (just the zest, not the white part), etc. If using
  cloves, cinnamon, or hops go lightly on these. Adding flavors in this
  manner also allows you to use different flavors in the same batch,
  since you're just adding a "tea" to the mead at bottling time. You
  can bottle two or three flavors at once this way! This mead should
  age from 3 months up to a year to allow the harsh flavors to mellow
  out. Tasting at 6 months will show approximate flavor profile. Serve
  well chilled.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish

      1 md Acorn squash, or another
           -winter squash of a similar
           -size
    1/3 c  Almonds; chopped
      1 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 c  Onions; chopped
    1/2 ts Thyme
      1 c  Barley; cooked
      1 tb Tamari
 
   Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Discard the seeds and membrane and
  place the squash cut-side down on a lightly oiled baking dish. Bake
  at 350 degrees until the squash is still firm, but tender enough to
  easily scoop out with a spoon, about 45 minutes.
  
   After the squash has been baking about 25 minutes, place the chopped
  almonds in a pie tin or another small ovenproof container and bake
  until they turna toasty light brown (10-15 minutes). Check boththe
  almonds and the sqash occasionally so you will know when they are
  done.
  
   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onions and the thyme.
  Saute over low heat until the onions are well done. Add the cooked
  barley, tamari, and toasted almonds to the sauteed onions.
  
   Using a small spoon, scoop bite-sized chunks out of the cooked
  squash, leaving enough flesh around the shell so that it stays strong
  enough to hold its shape. Add the scooped out squash to the barley
  mixture. Mix well. Fill the empty squash shells with this mixture,
  mounding it as high as possible.
  
   Place the stuffed squash in a baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil
  and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.

      Title: BARLEY BROTH WITH CHICKEN
 Categories: Soups/stews, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 oz Pot barley
  2 1/2 pt Good quality chicken stock
      1    Lemon
      1    Fat garlic clove
      2    Leeks
    1/4 lb Mushrooms
      2    Chicken livers, if available
           Cold cooked chicken meat *
      5 tb Coarsley chopped parsley
      1 sm Knob butter
 
  *Note: The recipe calls for 1-2 chicken livers, if available, and
  "shreds of cold cooked chicken meat, if available".
  
  Grate the zest of the lemon very finely and reserve it. Put the
  barley into a soup pan, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and cold chicken
  stock. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for about 40 minutes until
  the barley is tender with just a hint of bite to the centre of the
  grain. Add the chicken meat, if used, to the pan towards the end of
  this time to heat it through gently but thoroughly.
  
  When the barley is nearly ready, slice the mushrooms thickly, and
  slice the leeks (tender green parts as well as the white) very thinly
  indeed so that the leaves fall into ribbony shreds. Cut the chicken
  livers, if available, into 2 to 3 pieces and saute them briefly in
  the butter until crusty on the outside but still pink within. Fry the
  mushrooms in the fat remaining in the pan then reduce the heat and
  cook the leeks gently for 2 to 3 minutes, just shaking occasionally.
  Then add contents of the frying pan to the soup pan.  Add the
  mushrooms and check seasoning.
  
  Put the chicken livers into a warmed soup tureen and crush with a
  fork to make a coarse paste.  Add the finely chopped garlic, the
  lemon zest and most of the parsley. Pour on the piping hot soup, stir
  to mix well, sprinkle the rest of the parsley on top and serve.
  
  Note: If the soup is not served straight away, but allowed to get
  cold, the barley will go on swelling and softening; when reaheated
  the dish then seems more like a stew than a soup. I like it this way
  but you may prefer to lift out the grain and cool it down separately
  from the rest of the soup.

      Title: BARLEY CHIPS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 55 Servings
 
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Barley flour
    1/2 c  Rolled barley (barley
           Flakes)
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      8 tb (1 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  "Very few people really know the taste of barley. Rolled barley looks
  like oatmeal, but has a slightly sharper taste and less nutty flavor.
  These sweet barley crackers have a tender texture. Try them with just
  a cold glass of milk. 325~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to
  325~F.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, stir together the flours,
  barley, sugar, and salt.
  
  Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add enough
  of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
  ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut into 2-inch
  circles or squares and place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined
  baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a
  fork.
  
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until medium brown. Cool on a wire rack.
  Yield: 45-55.
  
  VARIATIONS: For a richer cracker, substitute 2 Tablespoons barley malt
  syrup for the sugar and reduce the amount of milk slightly.
  
  This recipe can be made with oatmeal (rolled oats) and oat flour for a
  distinctive oat flavor.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Big muffin
 
  2 1/2 c  Barley flour
      2 ts Baking powder
        ds Salt
      2    Eggs
    1/4 c  Rich cream
    1/4 c  Honey
 
  Sift together the barley flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat eggs
  slightly.  Combine eggs, cream, and honey with dry ingredients and mix
  well.  Pour batter into muffin tin and bake at 400 F for 25 minutes
  The same book says barley flour can be substituted for white flour
  and make an all-barley bread.  So it seems one could substitute oats
  for some of the barley in this recipe to make Barley/oats muffins.

      2 pk Instant broth/season
  2 1/2 c  Water
           Salt and pepper; to taste
  5 1/4 oz Barley; 3/4 cup
 
  Add your favorite spice to this casserole, if you wish. Try 1/2
  teaspoon of either curry powder, basil, oregano, dill or thyme or
  enjoy it as it is with the delicious subtle flavor of mushrooms. In a
  medium saucepan over medium heat cook onions & mushrooms till tender
  about 10 min adding small amounts of water if necessary to prevent
  drying. Add broth mix, water and salt & pepper and bring to a boil.
  Stir in barley, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 50min until
  barley is tender and liquid is absorbed. Stir occassionally while
  cooking and add more water if necessary. Note: I eliminated the 2T+2t
  of reduced calorie margarine to reduce the 5g per serving of fat in
  the original recipe.

      Title: BARLEY RISOTTO WITH ROASTED TOMATOES & NICO
 Categories: Rice and gr, Side dishes, Texas, Tomatoes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Tomatoes (about 1 1/2
           Pounds) -- cut crosswise
      5 c  Water -- more if needed
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock -- homemade or
           Canned
      1 tb Olive oil
      1    Onion -- chopped fine
  1 1/2 c  Pearl  barley (about 11
           Ounces)
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Butter
      6 tb Parmesan cheese -- grated
      2 tb Heavy cream -- optional
      3 tb Nicoise olives -- chopped
 
  Heat the oven to 300 degrees.  Put the halved tomatoes, cut-side up,
  on a baking sheet.  Dry the tomatoes in the oven until shriveled but
  still juicy, not hard and dry, about 2 hours. Let cool and then cut
  into 1/2-inch pieces.
  
  In a medium saucepan, bring the water and stock to a boil. Remove
  from the heat and keep covered.
  
  In another medium saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the
  onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5
  minutes.
  
  Add the barley and stir to coat.  Add about a third of the hot stock
  mixture and cook at a gentle boil, stirring occasionally, until
  absorbed. Add another third of the stock and cook, stirring
  frequently, until absorbed.  Add the remaining stock and the salt and
  cook, stirring frequently, until the barley is tender, about 1 hour
  and 15 minutes total cooking time. Any stock that has not been
  absorbed should be thickened by the starch from the barley.
  
  Stir the barley vigorously to make the texture creamier. If it is
  dry, add more water.  Stir in the butter, Parmesan, the cream, if
  using, and three quarters of both the tomatoes and the olives.  Serve
  the barley risotto topped with the remaining tomatoes and olives.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      7 tb Olive oil
      1    Shallot; minced
      2 c  Pearl barley
      8 c  Vegetable stock
      3    Japanese eggplant
     10    Lg shrimp; peeled cut 4 piec
    1/4 c  Grated pecorino cheese
 
  In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add
  shallot and cook, stirring, until translucent. Add barley; stir to
  coat with the oil. Reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking barley,
  stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes; take care not to let it
  brown. While barley is cooking, bring vegetable stock to a boil. Add
  vegetable stock to barley, a cup at time. Cook, stirring frequently,
  until liquid is almost absorbed before adding more liquid. Keep
  adding liquid, stirring frequently until barley pearls are al dente,
  about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes. Heat 4
  tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute
  eggplant, stirring frequently, until soft, about 12 minutes. Set
  aside. Using skillet in which eggplant was cooked, add remaining
  tablespoon of oil. Saute shrimp until pink. When barley is done, stir
  in eggplant and shrimp. Add grated pecorino cheese. Serve. Source:
  Odette Fada, Rex Il Restaurante, Los Angeles Fada's barley risotto is
  easy to make. It's a great way to offer the luxury of shellfish.
  Because the shrimp is cut into pieces, you only a half-pound of it to
  make risotto for 6-8 people. Despite the shrimp, this dish is
  predominantly grain. It's high in complex carbohydrates and fiber,
  and low in fat. But it's so exciting that one hesitates to label it
  with the stigma of "healthy eating." Best of all, here's a dish that
  fits the proverbial champagne taste on a beer budget; in total,
  ingredients for this risotto cost about $10. Add a salad and a cheese
  course and you can feed a small dinner party for about $5 a head.

  bowl or in the food processor, mix the oats with the flour, salt, and
  baking soda. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse
  meal.
  
  In a small bowl, dissolve the honey in the warm water and slowly
  blend this sweetened water into the flour mixture until the dough
  will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/8 inch. Cut out 2-inch crackers
  with a cookie cutter, juice can, or knife and arrange on a lightly
  greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
  
  With the tines of a fork, prick each cracker 2 or 3 times. Bake for 10
  minutes. Turn the crackers over and bake another 5 to 10 minutes, or
  until very lightly browned. The flavor of these crackers is best if
  they are not allowed to become more than pale brown.
  
  Cool the crackers on a rack. Yield: 60-70.

  Melt butter in a 6-quart (or larger) stockpot.  Add onions; cook,
  uncovered, over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. (The
  long cooking time makes the onions mellow and sweet.) Stir in pepper,
  paprika and bay leaf; saute over low heat 10 minutes more, stirring
  frequently. Pour in 6 cans broth and wine.  Increase heat and bring
  to a boil. Dissolve flour in remaining 1 can broth.  Stir into
  boiling soup. Reduce heat and simmer slowly for 2 hours. Adjust color
  to a rich brown with caramel coloring, season with salt. Refrigerate
  overnight. To serve, heat soup in microwave or on stove top. If
  desired, pour into ovenproof crocks or bowls. Top with a slice of
  breat and a sprinkling of grated cheese. Heat under the broiler until
  cheese melts and bubbles, about 5 minutes. Leftover soup can be

      Title: BASEL BRUNSLI (BASEL CHOCOLATE-SPICE COOKIES)
 Categories: Cookie/bars, Sweden
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Blanched whole almonds
           -(about 7 ounces)
  1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
  3 1/2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
  2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
      3 oz Bitterswet (not unsweetened)
           -or swmisweet
           Chocolate, chopped fairly
           -fine
    1/4 ts (generous) almond extract
      2 lg Egg whites
      2    To 5 Tbl confectioners'
           -sugar for rolling out
           -cookies
 
  Heat oven to 325F.  Line several baking sheets with aluminum foil.
  
  In a food processor, process the almonds and 1 cup powdered sugar
  until the almonds are powder-fine but not oily; stop the processor
  and scrape down the sides several times. Add the cocoa powder,
  cinnamon, cloves, and chocolate; continue processing until the
  chocolate is finely ground. Add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar,
  the almond extract, and egg whites; process until the mixture is
  blended and just forms a mass. Set the dough aside for 5 to 10
  minutes to stiffen slightly.
  
  Generously dust a work surface with powdered sugar. If the dough
  seems too soft to roll out easily, dust it with more sugar and knead
  until the consistency is manageable, but avoid adding any more sugar
  than absolutely necessary.  Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness,
  lifting it with a spatula frequently and redusting the surface and
  rolling pin with powdered sugar to prevent sticking.  Cut out the
  cookies using a 2 1/4-inch heart-shaped (or similar) cutter.  Use a
  spatula to transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets, about
  1 inch apart.
  
  Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes or until almost firm on top and
  slightly puffy.  Let them stand on the foil lined baking sheets until
  completely cooled. Peel from the foil. Store airtight for 3 to 4 days.
  Freeze, airtight, for longer storage.
  
  Makes about forty 2 1/4-inch cookies.

      Title: BASEL HONEY-SPICE COOKIES (BASEL LECKERLI)
 Categories: Cookies, Swedish
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Clover honey
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
      1 tb Kirsch (cherry brandy) or
           -orange juice
  2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
           Finely grated peel (yellow
           -part only) of one
           Large lemon
    1/4 c  Finely chopped candied lemon
           -peel
    1/4 c  Finely chopped candied
           -orange peel
    2/3 c  Finely chopped blanched
           -slivered almonds
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose or unbleached
           -white flour (or more)
  1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
    1/8 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Heat the oven to 350F.  Generously grease two 10-by-14-inch or larger
  baking shets.  Stir together the honey, sugar, and kirsch in a
  medium-sized saucepan over medium heat.  Heat the mixture, stirring,
  until the sugar completely dissolves and the mixture is hot but not
  boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the spices, lemon peel,
  candied peels, and almonds until completely incorporated.  Stirring
  vigorously, gradually ad 2 1/4 cups of flour to the pan; the mixture
  will become very stiff. If the mixture feels sticky and too soft to
  roll out, stir or knead in a bit more flour, but be careful not to
  overflour. Set the mixture aside until cooled to barely warm.
  
  Sprinkle a work surface generously with flour.  Divide the dough in
  half. Roll out half of dough into an 8 1/2-by-13-inch rectangle,
  frequently running a spatula under the dough and dusting the work
  surface. As needed, also dust the top of the dough and the rolling
  pin with flour. Transfer the dough to a prepared baking sheet. Repeat
  with the second half of the dough. Prick the dough lightly all over
  with the tines of a fork.
  
  Stagger the baking sheets on racks in the center third of the oven;
  switch positions halfway through the baking to ensure even browning.
  Bake for 13 to 16 minutes or until the dough top is just tinged with
  brown and slightly darker on the edges; avoid overbaking, as cookies
  will become crunchy and hard. Carefully run a spatula under the dough
  rectangles to loosen them from the pans.
  
  When just cool enough to handle, transfer the rectangles to a cutting
  board and cut away any uneven, dry edges using a large serrated
  knife. Deeply score the rectangles, but do not cut completely through
  the surface, lengthwise and crosswise, to yield 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars.
  Return the scored rectangles to the baking sheets. In a small
  saucepan stir together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons
  of water until thoroughly blended.  Bring the mixture to a boil,
  stirring. Boil, stirring, for 20 to 30 seconds, until smooth, very
  fluid, and translucent. Divide the mixture between the rectangles,
  pour over the top and quickly spread the glaze over the entire
  surface.  Let stand until the glaze sets and turns white again, about
  1 hour.  Bend the rectangles to break apart or cut through the score
  marks to separate into bars. Let stand until the glaze is dry and
  hard. Pack airtight. Store for up to 3 weeks or more.
  
  Makes 50 to 60 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars.

      Title: BASIC AREPA DOUGH
 Categories: Breads, Columbian, Venezuelan
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
      2 c  Pre-cooked masa flour
           -(yellow or white)
      1 ts Salt
      3 c  ;water, boiling
           Butter; softened
 
  Arepas are simple corn cakes first made by the Indians of Colombia and
  Venezuela. They were an important part of their diet, like corn
  tortillas were to the Aztecs.
  
  Over the centuries, the poor people of Colombia and Venezuela
  continued to use them as inexpensive, easy-to-prepare source of
  nourishment. Today, these humble corn cakes are a comfort food for
  the rich and poor alike, a heart-warming tribute to simplicity,
  tradition, versatility, and good taste.
  
  Originally, arepas were made from dried corn kernels that were soaked
  overnight in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, drained
  and ground into masa (dough). Thanks to modern technology, a
  pre-cooked harina de masa is now available at most Latin American
  markets. An instant masa can be made by simply mixing this corn flour
  (either white or yellow) with a little salt and enough boiling water
  to make a stiff dough.
  
  The dough is then shaped into flat round cakes of varying thicknesses,
  depending on the intended use, and cooked on a griddle or deep-fried.
  In parts of Colombia, arepas are cooked atop a flagstone slab that is
  first heated and then brushed with fat. Another Colombian specialty
  ~- arepas de chocolo -- are made from fresh corn and cooked on top of
  banana leaves.
  
  Colombian arepas are generally thinner than their Venezuelan
  counterparts. The standard Venezuelan arepa looks somewhat like a
  flat bread roll, crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside. They
  can be split open and buttered, or spread with cream cheese or fresh
  goat cheese. Made this way, they are served for breakfast or as an
  accompaniment for grilled fowl, fish, meat stews, or sausages.
  
  In Venezuela, the doughy inside is sometimes scooped out, and the
  shell is filled with savory mixtures of ground or chopped pork, beef,
  ham, chicken, seafood, vegetables, or beans. They are excellent first
  courses. Venezuelan mandocas, for example, are cheese arepas shaped
  into rings and deep-fried. Another specialty is bollos pelones --
  balls of arepa dough stuffed with seasoned ground meat, either fried
  or poached in water, then served with tomato sauce.
  
  A popular snack in Colombia consists of arepas served with fresh
  cheese and fried chorizo (sausage). Colombians also make tasty soups
  using fresh masa or leftover arepas. Arepitas dulces make great
  desserts.
  
  The versatile arepa indeed proves that umpretentioius food can be not
  only satisfying but also delicious.
  
  Directions:
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add water, stir with a
  wooden spoon to make a soft dough. Let stand for 5 minutes, then
  knead for 3 minutes. Dough is ready to be shaped into standard
  arepas, or to be mixed and kneaded with other ingredients such as
  cheese, chicharrones (pork rind), etc.
  
  Venezuelan arepa is 3 inches in diameter, 3/4 inch thick. Columbian
  arepas are larger and thinner, about 4 inches in diameter, 1/4 inch
  thick. To make arepas, oil or wet hands lightly and shape dough into
  balls. Place between 2 pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap and
  flatten into a circle; shape the edges to form a smooth disc.
  
  To cook arepas: Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium heat;
  grease lightly and cook arepas on both sides, turning a couple of
  times until a crust is formed. Colombian arepas are ready to be
  served at this point, spread with butter. Venezuelan arepas have to
  be baked in a preheate 350-degree oven for 15 minutes. To check for
  doneness, tap the arepa lightly ~- if a hollow sound is heard, it's
  ready. Split open, add butter and serve hot.
  
  Arepas freeze well if frozen while still warm. Freeze in layers
  separated by plastic wrap. Reheat frozen arepas wrapped in aluminum
  foil in a preheated 350-degree oven for 10 minutes or until heared
  through.

 Categories: Indian, Sauces, Balti
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      4    Onions, chopped
           Small piece of ginger,
           Peeled and grated
      1    Large garlic clove, crushed

    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Cumin (ground)

      1 ts Chili powder
           Fresh chopped coriander
           (a handful)
           Salt to taste
 
  Heat the oil in a large saucepan over moderate heat. Fry the onions,
  ginger and garlic until the onions are translucent. Add the tomato
  and stir-fry, breaking it up with the spoon. Pour in 300 ml / 1/2 UK
  pint water, and stir in the other ingredients.  Bring to the boil.
  Lower heat, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and
  allow to cool. Pour into a blender or food processor and liquidize.
  
  (Note:  this is only one formula of thousands possible. There's no
  more a single recipe for Balti sauce than there's a single recipe for
  chili. Some cooks like more garlic, some more chili powder;  some use
  fresh chilies as well:  some add yogurt, coconut, cream...you name
  it.)

  Continue cooking until carrots and potatoes are tender but not mushy,
  about 20 minutes. Heat any remaining bacon fat in a large skillet,
  add pearl onions and cook, stirring, until onions are golden on all
  sides. Stir onions into stew. Cook five minutes. Sprinkle stew with
  crisp bacon pieces and chopped parsley. Sevre over cooked noodles or

      Title: BASIC BISCOTTI
 Categories: Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 72 Servings
 
      4 oz Blanched almonds
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      3    Eggs
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and toast them
  in oven until lightly golden. Let cool. Coarsely chop half the nuts.
  Butter 2 large baking sheets. Mix flour, sugar, salt and baking soda.
  Beat in eggs, then whole and chopped nuts. Mix to obtain a firm
  dough. Knead briefly, then divide dough into 4 pieces. On a floured
  work surface, roll each piece under your hands into a cylinder 15
  inches long and about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place 2 rolls, well
  separated, on each baking sheet and bake 15 to 20 minutes, until very
  lightly browned and firm to the touch. With a spatula, carefully
  transfer the rolls to a cutting board and slice each one diagonally
  into cookies about 1/2-inch thick. Set wire racks on the baking
  sheets and lay out the biscotti on them. Return them to the oven for
  20 to 30 minutes, or until very firm and crisp. Cool on the racks,
  then transfer them to a tin for long keeping. Try adding 1 1/2-to-2
  tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to this recipe for a nice
  variation.

      2 lb Jerusalem artichokes
           Salt
           Ulsalted butter -- melted
 
  1.  Wash and gently scrub the artichokes under cook, running water.
  If they have just come out of the refrigerator, let them until they
  warm to room temperature, about an hour. 2. Put just enough cold
  water to cover the artichokes in a kettle that will comfortably hold
  them. Turn on the heat to medium-high and bring the water to a boil.
  3. Throw in a small handful of salt and add the artichokes. Let the
  water return to biling and reduce the heat to medium. Simmer,
  uncovered, until they are to the level of tenderness that the
  individual recipe requires. To eath them plain or in salads, they
  should be just tender and may take as little as 10 minutes ; for
  creamed, or mashed, artichokes, they should be as soft as boiled
  potatoes and may take as long as half an hour. 4. Drain them well and
  serve warm with lots of melted butter following a recipe for mashed
  potatoes.

      Title: BASIC BREAD & ROLLS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Milk
      1    Fresh Cake Yeast
    1/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Shortening
      1 ts Salt
      1    Egg
  3 1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Lukewarm Water
 
  Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, & salt. Let it cool to
  lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water.
  When soft, add the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg
  mixture into the milk mixture and stir them together. The flour may
  be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large spoon, stir until
  flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm, but not stiff
  dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough with a
  plate or towel and set aside to rise until double in bulk (about 2
  hrs depending on the temperature in the kitchen). Instead of letting
  the dough rise at this point you may put it in the refrigerator and
  use it later, or the next day.  Watch to make sure it doesn't spill
  out of the bowl.  If it starts to spill before you're ready to use
  it, punch it back down. Refrigerated dough is easier to handle but
  takes longer to rise. BREAD: If you want to make bread, dump the
  dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface and with more flour as
  needed to keep it from sticking, knead it until springy and easy to
  handle. This dough does not require a lot of kneading; only enough to
  make it easy to handle. For 2 medium size loaves cut the dough in
  half and knead/shape each into loaves and put into greased baking
  pans. Allow about 2 hours for the dough to double again. Bake in a
  375 degree oven until lightly browned on top (if uncertain whether or
  not bread is done, tip out of pan and see if bottom is browned too).
  ROLLS: To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily
  handled. Roll out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter
  and fold over and place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse
  rolls), or break dough into small pieces, make into little balls and
  place 3 in each section of a greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls).
  SWEET ROLLS: For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as
  for Parkerhouse rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a
  round. Spread it with raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.
  Dot with butter and roll as for a jelly roll.  Slice and place on a
  greased pan or make into a circle and make slashes through the dough
  at intervals. Let rise and bake as for loaves. Top with an icing made
  of confectioners' sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla or rum
  flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls while hot. Decorate
  with nuts or fruits. If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use
  half white and half whole wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of
  white.  The amounts above will yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of
  bread, or 2 dozen large rolls.

      Title: BASIC BREAD MACHINE RECIPE
 Categories: Breads, Low-fat, Breadmaker
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
  2 3/4 ts Yeast
      1 ts Malt
     11 oz Water (110 - 120 deg.F)
      3 c  Whole Wheat flour
    1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
      2 tb Sugar, honey, molasses...
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Gluten
 
  put yeast and malt into machine with several oz. of water. Use a
  thermometer for the water. Too hot will kill the yeast. The yeast
  will now proof (start to multiply) In a separate bowl, measure out
  all dry ingredients and mix. After a few minutes, yeast should be
  bubbling, add dry stuff and any liquids including the water. start
  the machine and see how it looks. If too dry, add until it looks
  right. Should be one big mass not several. Flour:  I often substitute
  1 cup of corn or rye + 1 heaping T of gluten for a cup of WW flour.
  For sweet breads, add another few T of sugar (I commonly use honey,
  molasses, or malt powder) and may some raisins. 3 T of carroway seeds
  or sesame seeds in a non sweet bread is great. I have also added 2
  mashed bananas, then cut the water.

      Title: BASIC BREAD SPONGE
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 ts Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Water -- 105-115 degrees
      4 c  All-purpose flour --
           Unbleached
 
  Whisk the yeast into the water.  Allow to sit for about three
  minutes. Add the flour, mixing for another three minutes. Place in a
  nonreactive bowl and cover. Allow to sit in a draft-free spot until
  it rises and gets thick and sticky.  This will take about eight hours.
  
  Use a spoon to stir the sponge down before measuring for use in a
  bread.
  
  Once risen, refrigerate for up to three days.  Allow to come to room
  temperature before using.  If it goes beyond three days, discard all
  but 1 cup of the sponge and make the recipe, adding the reserved
  sponge with the flour.  Stir for two or three minutes before using.
  
  For all of the breads based upon this sponge, allow two days since the
  doughs require overnight refrigeration.
  
  For the best results, use as little of the kneading flour as possible.
  
  To allow yourself to slide the loaves into the oven, form them on a
  baking sheet without sides or on the bottom of one with sides that is
  turned upside-down.
  
  If you do not have a stone or tiles, bake directly on the baking
  sheet(s) upon which you formed the loaves (be sure to use either
  cornmeal or parchment between the dough and the sheet).
  
  All of the breads based upon the sponge can be frozen for up to two
  weeks. Don't freeze until the bread has cooled thoroughly - then wrap
  in foil and freeze. When ready to use, thaw them, still wrapped, at
  room temperature overnight.  Then, unwrap and warm at 350 degrees for
  5 or 10 minutes. Alternatively, you could warm the frozen and wrapped
  loaves at
      300    for 35 to 40 minutes.

  While this very basic sauce is excellent by itself over beef,
  noodles, and some game, such as venison and bear, it is generally
  used as a base for other more complex sauces. It may seem very time
  consuming to make a brown stock, then this basic brown sauce and then
  a finished sauce, but the result is well worth the effort. Both the
  stock and this sauce can be frozen for up to three months, which
  means you can make your own instant bases to have on reserve, which
  will speed up the process.

  1 1/2 c  Crushed graham crackers
           -(1 package)
    1/4 c  Sugar
      5 tb Melted butter
 
  Mix the graham crackers and sugar, then add butter and mix with a fork
  until completely moistened.  Press mixture into the bottom and up
  1/3rd of the side of a 9-inch springform pan. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
  
  Variations:  Use ginger snaps instead of graham crackers for a spicier
  crust or for cakes like pumpkin. Use chocolate wafers instead of
  graham crackers for a chocolate, white chocolate, or certain
  fruit-flavored or ~topped cheesecakes like raspberry, cherry, or
  orange. For a sweeter, moister crust (do this only if the cheesecake
  is going to get eaten quickly, because it gets mushy faster) use
  brown sugar instead of white.

      Title: BASIC CHEESECAKE FILLING
 Categories: Cheesecake, Kooknet, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      1 lb To 2 lb cream cheese
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      2    To 3 eggs
    1/2 c  Yogurt or sour cream
    3/4 c  Liqueur or fruit/vegetable
           -puree
      1 tb Vanilla
      1 ts Or more other flavored
           -extracts,
           -if desired
 
  Here's where it gets fun.  The more cream cheese you use, the denser
  the cheesecake will be (but not dry!) The more eggs you use, the
  fluffier it will be. There's a delicate balance here - 1 lb cheese
  and 3 eggs will give you a fluffy cheesecake, but if you use 2 lbs
  cheese, 3 eggs is an absolute must if you don't want it to be flat.
  More eggs than 3, and you'll taste the eggs.  1 lb cheese and 2 eggs
  is a nice balance, too, but going any lower than that you'll just end
  up with something flat.
  
  The powdered sugar works best for two reasons - number one, powdered
  sugar contains corn starch, which acts as a thickener, and number
  two, you don't have to worry about the grittiness of undissolved
  sugar in your cake. The yogurt or sour cream adds moistness and a
  little bit of tang to the cake. It's not necessary, but it adds oomph
  to either a bland cake or a citrus-flavored cake.  For liqueur, add
  no more than 1/2 cup if you're using the yogurt or sour cream, and
  make sure you're using the three eggs. If you eliminate the
  yogurt/sour cream, you can increase the liqueur to 3/4 cup, and 2
  eggs will work (but three is still better - two works best only if
  you're not using the yogurt/sour cream >and< your liqueur is only 1/2
  cup.)  A fruit or vegetable puree should be relatively dry - drain
  off the liquid in a sieve, or put it in a saucepan, mix in some
  cornstarch, and heat it until it's thick. You can use an entire cup
  of puree if you eliminate the yogurt/sour cream. Either mix in the
  puree with the batter, or reserve a cup or so of batter, mix it with
  the puree, then swirl it into the cheesecake.
  
  The vanilla is a must, in my opinion.  Lots of times, I'll throw in an
  extra teaspoon for good measure. Other extracts can enhance the
  flavor - banana extract in a strawberry cheesecake, coconut extract
  or almond extract in an Amaretto cheesecake, etc.
  
  Another addition would be cocoa or chocolate.  Cocoa mixes in nicely
  without making the cheesecake gooey - 4-6 Tbsp will do it. Melted
  chocolate or white chocolate chips shouldn't really exceed 6 oz, even
  4 oz will usually do enough for the flavor.  If you're doing the
  swirl thing, use only 2-3 oz melted chocolate for the batter that's
  being swirled in. Make sure the melted stuff is cooled before you mix
  it in.

  Let cream cheese sit out until it's room temperature, nice and soft.
  Beat the cream cheese and sugar together until fluffy. Add eggs one
  at a time (break them into a separate cup - one teensy bit of shell

  Jam may be melted and poured evenly over the top of the cooled cake.
  
  Fruits may be arranged on top of a cooled cake, then covered with a
  melted jam glaze.
  
  4 oz chocolate or white chocolate chips, melted with 2-3 Tbsp butter
  and maybe 1 -2 Tbsp whipping cream (if desired) can be poured on top
  of the cooled cake.
  
  For a yogurt or sour cream topping, cook the cake only 50 minutes,
  cool the cake 15 minutes, mix together 1 cup yogurt or sour cream
  with 1/4 cup sugar (regular is OK since this is so liquid) and 1 Tbsp
  vanilla or other flavoring (lemon juice, extract, etc.) raise the
  oven temperature to 475 and bake another 10 minutes.

  forming. Set pudding off heat and let partially cool while preparing
  the egg whites.  Pour pudding into cooled crust.  Top with stiffly
  beaten egg whites. Bake at 350 F. until whites begin to brown, about

 Categories: Vegetarian, Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 md Onion
      1 md Celery stalk
      1 md Garlic clove
      1 tb Olive oil
      4 c  Vegetable; chopped in 1/2 to
           -1-inch pieces:
           Cauliflower
           Asparagus
           Broccoli
           Any other vegetable
      5 c  ;water
      2 tb Miso, light OR
      2    Vegetable bouillon cubes
           Pepper, freshly ground, opt.
 
   1. Bring water to a boil in a tea kettle. Coarsely chop the onion and
  celery. Thinly slice the garlic.
  
   2.  In a soup pot, heat oil, onion, garlic and celery.
   Cook and stir 1 minute over medium heat, then add vegetable. Continue
  cooking and stirring 1 minute longer.
  
   3. Add boiling water and bring back to a boil over high heat. Stir
  briefly and reduce heat to medium.
   Cover and cook 8 minutes. Lift cover, stir in miso, and continue
  cooking and stirring for another 2 minutes, until miso is dissolved
  and vegetables are tender. (At this point, you may puree soup
  directly in the pot with a hand blender, liquefying a small amount of
  soup with the tahini in a separate bowl and returning it to the pot.
  Or, follow steps 4-6.
  
   4. Pour soup into a bowl to cool. Remove 1/2 cup of broth from soup
  and stir remaining soup to cool it.
   While soup is cooling, place tahini and 1/2 cup broth in a blender.
  Blend to a smooth cream. Set aside.
  
   5.  Place three-fourths of soup in blender and liquefy to a cream.
  Pour into original soup pot. Place remaining one-quarter of unblended
  soup in a blender.
   Pulse-blend for 2 to 3 seconds, allowing mixture to remain lumpy and
  textured. Pour it into creamed portion in the original soup pot.
  
   6. Place soup over medium heat and stir in tahini mixture. Gently
  reheat soup, taking care not to let it boil and stirring frequently.
  Add pepper to taste.
  
   Variations:
  
   If you don't have light miso, substitute 2 vegetable bouillon cubes,
  2 tbs powdered vegetable broth, or 5 cups of homemade stock in place
  of 5 cups water.
  
   Creamed soups can be served hot or cold. If serving cold, skip the
  reheating.
  
   Add 1/2 tsp dried thyme, basil or marjoram to the sauteeing
  vegetables for fuller flavor.
  
   Add 1 tbs nutritional yeast to the soup pot when you add the water.
  
   Note: After the tahini mixture has been added to the cream soup,
  boiling will make the tahini itself thicken and the soup will be too
  thick. Take care to reheat it GENTLY, _not_to_boil_!

      Title: BASIC CREAMED CORN
 Categories: Corn, Starters
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 tb Butter or margarine
      3 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Warmed lowfat milk, whole
           -milk or light cream
      3 c  Fresh corn kernels, cut
           -from about 5 ears of corn
           Salt to taste
           White pepper to taste

MMMMM----------------------ADD FOR VARIETY---------------------------
           Chopped chives
           Julienne red pepper strips
           Julienne green pepper strips
           Shredded carrot
           Sauteed button mushrooms
        pn Curry powder
           Crumbled bacon
 
  Melt butter, stir in flour. Add milk slowly, stirring with whisk until
  completely blended, thickened and gently bubbling. Add kernels and
  simmer about 3 minutes. Season with salt and white pepper.
  
  Leftover Creamed Corn; pureed in blender or food processor, makes a
  quick sauce for shrimp, scallops or crab. Mix cooked seafood into
  corn sauce, simmer gently and spoon over a toasted English muffin.
  
  Although any variety of fresh corn will do, white, thin-skinned
  kernels make a superb creamed vegetable dish.

      Title: BASIC CREME BRULEE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Whipping Cream
      5    Egg Yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 tb Vanilla Extract
    1/2 c  Light Brown Sugar -- firmly
           Packed
 
  Combine the first 4 ingredients, stirring with a wire whisk until
  sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth. Carefully pour the egg mixture
  evenly into 5 (5x1) round baking dishes or custard cups. Place in a
  roasting pan large enough to accomodate the dishes and add 1/2-inch
  of water to the roasting pan. This step creates a water bath to
  prevent curdling. Bake at 275 for 45 to 50 minutes or until almost
  set. Cool the custards in the water in the pan set on a wire rack.
  Remove from pan when cooled, cover and refrigerate overnight. When
  ready to serve, sprinkle about 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar evenly
  over each custard; place each custard on a cookie sheet or jelly-roll
  pan. Broil 5 inches from heat. If using an electric oven, leave door
  partially open. Broil until the sugar melts. Let stand 5 minutes to
  allow sugar to harden.
  
  NOTES:
  
  Handle with care. These are extremely hot. Place custards as close to
  heat source as possible. To achieve a "cracked" effect, broil
  custards in a pan full of ice. Dixie Crystals sugar is reputedly the
  best for making this dessert. ***When finished cooking, the center
  will still be slightly liquid.

      Title: BASIC CREME BRULEE-WASHINGTON POST
 Categories: Dessert, France, Pudding
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Whipping cream
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1    Vanilla beans, split
           Or
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      5    Egg yolks
 
  Preheat oven to 325 F. Combine cream, half the sugar and vanilla in a
  heavy saucepan and scald (bring just to a boil). Remove from heat. If
  using a vanilla bean, cover and let infuse for 10 minutes, then
  remove bean. Meanwhile, wisk the egg yolks with the rest of the sugar
  until slightly thickened. Slowly wisk a small amount of the cream
  mixture iinto the egg yolks. (This will warm the egg yolks and
  prevent them from curdling.) When the yolks have warmed up , wisk the
  yolk mixture back into the rest of the cream. Strain this cream
  mixture into four 6 oz ovenproof ramekins. Put the ramekins into an
  ovenproof pan and put it in the oven. Fill the pan 1/3 to 1/2 full of
  water. Bake until barely set, about 40 to 45 minutes. (When gently
  shaken, the custard should jiggle but not be too loose.) Remove
  ramekins from water bath, wipe bottoms and chill in refrigerator
  several hours to overnight. To serve: Spread an even layer of sugar
  on each crreme brulee and melt the sugar carrefully with a small
  propane torch. Allow sugar to harden for a few minutes, then serve.
  To use a broiler instead of a torch, place ramekins in a large pan
  surrounded by ice (this keeps the custard ffrom overcooking.) Broil
  as close as possible to the heat source until the sugar melts and
  caramelizes, about 2 to 3 minutes. Once the sugar has hardened serve
  immediately.

  2 1/2 lb Dry Candy Fondant
      1 c  Butter

MMMMM----------------------------ADD---------------------------------
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
 
  Mix first 2 ingred. & let set overnight <or for several hours> tightly
  covered. Add cream & whip with heavy duty mixer or by hand. Divide
  dough into separate bowls. <I divide into 3>. Makes nice batch of
  each. For each bowl, add whatever color/flavor, etc you like. Below
  are some ideas: Vanilla cremes: add vanilla ****to taste. Chocolate
  cremes: add melted dark chocolate to taste. Mint center: add drops of
  peppermint oil & pink coloring. Black Walnut center: add drops black
  walnut oil & bl walnuts. Peanutbutter cremes: add smooth or crunchy
  peanut butter. Pineapple cremes: add drops pineapple oil, chopped
  candied pineapple & chopped pecans. Jelly: add fruit "flavored" jelly
  into candy mold with matching flavored oil w/creme center. Nut
  center: wrap creme center mix around a nut meat as filling; dip in
  white/tinted, or milk chocolate. Chocolate covered cherries <cream
  type:> wrap creme center  mix around a well-drained marachino
  cherry...be sure the cherry is SEALED in the dough, chill & dip in
  choc.* Be sure to dip as soon as removing from fridge. The acid in
  the cherry causes it to start cordialing <liquifying> quickly. Will
  liquify some, but some will remain "creamy" because of the butter.
  Coconut cremes: add maccaroon coconut & drops or coconut oil For any
  dipped cremes: Form 1" balls, let crust over & dip in compound
  coating chocolate. This is also called "dipping chocolate." I prefer
  the brand "Merckens." It seems to take more abuse/ reheating, or
  getting too hot, etc. Dolores McCann, Hamilton Ohio

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      1 ts Sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter or oil; melted/cooled
 
  Mixing crepes by hand.
  
  Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl.  Break the eggs into another
  bowl and mix until yolks and whites are blended. Make a hole in the
  middle of the dry ingredients and pour in beaten eggs. (French chefs
  often break the eggs right into the dry ingredients but this makes
  mixing more difficult.
  
  Stir the flour mixture into the eggs little by little. The dough will
  be difficult to work and it may be necessary to add a little milk (or
  whatever liquid is used in the particular recipe) to incorporate all
  the flour. Add the liquid a spoonful at a time and mix it in
  thoroughly before adding more liquid.  When the mixture becomes easy
  to work (when about half of the liquid has been used) the remainder
  can be added in two portions.
  
  Add melted butter (and flavorings if indicated).
  
  Mix again, cover and set aside for at least an hour but not more than
  6 hours at room temperature.  Crepe batter can be held overnight in
  the refrigerater.  If necessary, the crepe batter can be cooked
  immediately, but the "resting" time allows the flour to absorb more
  liquids, makes the mabber easier to handle, and gives the crepes more
  flavor. Since flours vary in their ability to absorb liquid, if the
  crepe batter seems too thick when you are ready to cook it, a small
  amount of extra liquid can be added at this time.  The consistency
  could be at least as thin as heavy cream.

      Title: BASIC CREPES
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    Egg substitutes
  1 1/4 c  Water
      1 c  Rice milk
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour or
           Unbleached white flour
 
  Put all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend at high
  speed for 1 min.  Refrigerate, covered for 2 hrs. before cooking.
  Batter should have consistency of heavy cream. If necessary, thin
  with more liquid.
  
  To cook crepes, heat an omelet or crepe pan on low heat for a few
  minutes. No need to add oil, these cook fine without it. Remove from
  heat, pour in 3 or 4 tablespoons of batter and tilt pan so batter
  coats the bottom. Put pan on burner, cook crepe for a few minutes
  over medium low heat until lightly browned or batter begins to
  bubble. Flip crepe over and cook other side for about 30 sec.  Gently
  remove and place on a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter,
  stacking crepes as they're cooked. Use with favorite breakfast,
  dinner or dessert crepe filling.
  
  Note:  I didn't notice this until I started typing this in, but I
  didn't cook mine on med-low heat.  I heated my pan on med-high and
  turned it down a notch when ready to cook. They turned out fine,
  didn't stick and the edges were just a little crispy (the way I like
  'em).

MMMMM---------------------------BASIC--------------------------------
      2 qt Cold water
      1    Med. onion, (see note)
      1    Large clove garlic (note)
           Bones, excess meat (notes)

MMMMM--------------------FOWL AND GAME STOCKS-------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Backs, necks, bones (notes)

MMMMM--------------------BEEF OR TURTLE STOCK-------------------------
      2 lb Beef shank (see notes)

MMMMM-------------------------PORK STOCK------------------------------
      2 lb Pork neck bones (see notes)

MMMMM-----------------------SEAFOOD STOCK----------------------------
      2 lb Rinsed shrimp heads (notes)
 
  Notes:  To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable trimmings from
  the recipe(s) you are serving, in place of the onion, garlic and
  celery. The recipe calls for the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and
  quartered.
     Also, you may include bones and any excess meat (excluding livers)
  from meat or poultry, or shells or carcasses from seafood, used in
  the recipe(s) you're cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2
  pounds backs, necks and/or bones from chickens, guinea hens, ducks,
  geese, rabbits, etc. FOR BEEF OR TURTLE STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds
  beef shank (preferred) or other beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK:
  1-1/2 to 2 pounds pork neck bones (preferred) or other pork bones.
  FOR SEAFOOD STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds rinsed shrimp heads and/or
  shells, or crawfish heads and/or shells, or crab shells (2-1/2 to 3
  quarts), or rinsed fish carcasses (heads and gills removed), or any
  combination of these. (you can also substitute oyster liquor for all
  or part of seafood stock called for in a recipe). NOTE: If desired,
  you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350F until
  thoroughly browned. Then use them to make your basic stock. (When you
  brown the bones and vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes
  on the surface, which gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color
  when it dissolves in the stock water.) Always start with cold
  water--enough to cover the other stock ingredients.
   Place all ingredients in a stock pot or a large saucepan. Bring to a
  boil over high heat, then gently simmer at least 4 hours, preferably
  8 (unless directed otherwise in a recipe), replenishing the water as
  needed to keep about 1 quart of liquid in the pan. The pot may be
  uncovered, or set the lid on it askew. Strain, cool and refrigerate
  until ready to use.
   (Note: Remember if you are short on time, using a stock simmered 20
  to 30 minutes is far better than using just water in any recipe..) TO
  MAKE A RICH STOCK: Strain the basic stock, then continue simmering
  until evaporation reduces the liquid by half or more. For example, if
  your recipe calls for 1 cup "Rich Stock," start it with at least 2
  cups of strained basic stock. (Rich stocks are needed when a sauce
  requires lots of taste but only a limited amount of liquid, for
  example, "Oyster Sauce for Beef." From The Prudhomme Family Cookbook

           Pounds
           Optional: lemon wedge, about
           1/4 of medium lemon
           Salt and pepper to taste
           (see Cook's Note)
           Optional: 1 bay leaf
           Optional: 2-4 sprigs, fresh
           Thyme
 
  Cook's Note: If you plan to serve the chicken cut into serving pieces
  rather than cutting it up and using it in other dishes, sprinkle the
  top of the chicken with seasoned salt, such as Lawry's, to give it
  more color.
  
  1. Remove giblets from interior of chicken.  Remove fat pads on
  either side of the opening to the interior cavity.  Wash chicken with
  cold water and shake off excess water.  Place in a 3-1/2 or 4 quart
  crockpot, breast side up.
  
  2. Place lemon wedge and bay leaf inside cavity, if using.  Season
  top of chicken with salt and pepper to taste.  Scatter sprigs of
  thyme around chicken.
  
  3. Cook on low power for 7 to 8-1/2 hours.

      2    Onions, chopped
      2    3 cloves garlic
      1 lb Dried beans, soaked 4 hours
           Or over night
      1    2 bay leaves
           Water to cover.
 
  Put in crockpot and cook about 4-6 hours on high or overnight on low.
  Beans should be soft (small white beans take longest, pinto beans
  shorter)
  
  Add spices, veggies, etc. (see below) cook about another hour.
  
  Spices:, veggies, etc:
  
  1) 1 tsp dried cumin, 1 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1-2
  Tbsp. soy sauce,   a few chili peppers, chopped, chopped green
  pepper, can chopped tomotoes, some frozen corn. (Good with black
  beans) 1/2 tsp liquid smoke tastes good added.
  
  2) 1 tsp cumin, 1 can chopped green chilis, chopped green pepper, 1
  Tbsp soy sauce (good with white beans).
  
  3) 1-2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1/4 cup molasses, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp
  dried mustard, (good with pinto or black eyed peas)
  
  Garbanzo beans I usually use as a substiute in chicken recipes, so
  I'll freeze them with just the onions and garlic. Frozen black eyed
  peas are also a good staple to have on hand (for some reason that's

      Title: BASIC CRUMPET
 Categories: British, Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
           OR 1 cake compressed yeast
    1/4 c  Water*
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Butter or margarine
      1 c  Milk, scalded
      1    Egg
      3 c  All purpose flour
 
  *Use very warm water (105-115 degrees for dry yeast, lukewarm (80-90
  degree) for compressed yeast.
  
  Sprinkle dry yeast or crumble cake yeast into water.  Let stand for a
  few minutes; then stir until dissolved.  Add sugar, salt, and butter
  to warm milk, stirring to dissolve; cool to lukewarm.  Add egg, yeast
  mixture and flour and beat thoroughly.  Let batter rise in warm place
  for 30 minutes; with spoon beat for 3 minutes.
  
  Repeat rising and beating and then rising again.
  
  Pour batter into greased 4 inch muffin rings on medium hot greased
  griddle (325 degrees on electric griddle) filling rings one third
  full.
  
  Bake until well risen and browned on one side.  Turn over, rings and
  all, and brown on other side (should take about 18 to 20 minutes)
  
  Remove, cool, split, and toast.
  
  Although crumpets are similar to English muffin, crumpets are softer
  in texture with surface holes appearing during the pan cooking; these
  holes enable the crumpet to absorb great quantities of butter.

      Title: BASIC CURRY SAUCE
 Categories: Sauce
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 tb Vegetable oil or ghee
           -(clarified butter)
      1 lg Onion finely chopped
      4 cl Garlic peeled and sliced
  1 1/2    Inch piece root ginger
           -peeled and sliced
      2    Fleshy green chiles of
           -your choice de seeded and
           -veined then chopped
    1/2 ts Turmeric powder
    1/2 ts Ground cumin seed
    1/2 ts Ground coriander seed
      4 tb Plain passata (smooth,
           -thick, sieved tomatoes)
           -or
      1 tb Concentrated tomato purée
 
  This is the basis for many of the restaurant-style curries you'll
  find . The curry recipes use half or two-thirds of the amount that
  this recipe gives. If you have some left over you could use it in a
  vegetable curry or freeze it. The recipe doesn't work as well if you
  try to make a smaller portion. It will keep in good condition in the
  freezer but only for a few weeks. Remember to wrap it up well or your
  ice-cream may take on a strange taste!. A. Heat the oil in a heavy
  pan then add the chopped onion and stir for a few minutes with the
  heat on high B. Add the ginger, garlic, green chile, turmeric, cumin
  and coriander. Stir for 30 seconds then put the heat down to very low
  C. Cook for 20 minutes stirring from time to time making sure nothing
  browns or burns D. Take off the heat and cool a little. Put 4 fl oz
  cold water in a blender, add the contents of the pan and whizz until
  _very_ smooth. Add the passata and stir E. Put the puréed mixture
  back into the pan, add the salt and cook for 30 minutes over low heat
  stirring occasionally to stop it catching on the pan (you can add a
  little hot water if it gets too dry)

      Title: BASIC CUSTARD QUICHE
 Categories: Quiche, Inn recipes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Pastry: *
           Filling:
      3    Eggs
      2 tb Flour
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground white pepper
      1 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  Recipe by: Inn recipes *1 recipe Piret's Quiche Pastry or Vienna
  Pastry. 1. Line the quiche pan with the pastry, pinch up a rim, and
  prick the bottom all over with a fork. Partially bake the pastry, if
  you wish, and set it aside. 2. To make the filling: Whisk together
  the eggs, flour, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Blend in the cream,
  and then the milk. 3. Evenly distribute whatever cheese, meat, and/or
  vegetables you are using in the prepared shell, and pour in the
  custard filling. (if you are using high-moisture vegetables, such as
  tomatoes, zucchini, or mushrooms, they should be cooked first to
  evaporate some of their water content.). 4. Preheat oven to 375.
  Place the filled pan on a baking sheet. Generally, custard quiches
  should be baked for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the custard is just
  set. Let the quiche rest for 8 to 10 minutes before slicing and
  serving it. Make one 9 to 11-inch or four 4-inch tarts. This is the
  basic custard mixture that goes into many of our quiches. Some of our
  favorite combinations appear below, but we hope you'll use them as
  inspiration for your own creations. Just about any combination of
  grated cheese, vegetables, leftover meat, poultry, or seafood, or
  whatever else appeals to you can be added to this all-purpose
  custard.JM. Mary Prentiss Inn Cambridge, Massachusetts

      Title: BASIC DINNER ROLLS
 Categories: Breads, Rolls, Dinner, Book, Tried 1994
      Yield: 32 Rolls
 
      6 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Active dry yeast
      1 c  Water
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Margarine/butter
      1    Egg
 
  	   Melted margarine/butter if 	 Desired
  
  In large bow;, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast; blend
  well. In small saucepan, heat water, milk and 1/2 cup margarine until
  very warm (120-130 F.). Add warm liquid and egg to flour mixture.
  Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed.
  By hand, stir in an additional 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour until dough
  pulls clenaly away from sides of bowl. On floured surface, knead 1
  1/4 to 1 3/4 cups flour until dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 to
  10 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl; cover loosely with plastic
  wrap and cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80 to 85 F.) until
  light and doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes. Punch down dough
  several times to remove all air bubbles. Divide dough in half. To
  make PAN ROLLS, lightly grease two 13x9-inch pans. Divide each half
  of dough into 16 equal pieces. Shape each into a ball, pulling edges
  under to make a smooth top. PLace balls, smooth side up, in greased
  pans. Cover; let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size,
  about 20-30 minutes. Heat oven to 400 F. Uncover dough. Bake at 400
  F. for 16 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove rolls from pans
  immediately; cool on wire racks. Brush with melted margarine.
  
  TIP: To make dough a day ahead, after first rise time, punch down
  dough, cover and refrigerate dough overnight. Shape dough as directed
  in recipe; let rise a second time until light and doubled in size,
  about 25 to 35 minutes. Source: The Complete Pillsbury Book of Baking

      Title: BASIC DIVINITY
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  White Sugar; Granulated
    1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup
    1/2 c  Water
      1 pn Salt (1/8 tsp)
      2    Egg Whites; Lg
      1 ts Vanilla Extract
      1 c  Nuts; Chopped, OR
      1 c  Cherries; Chopped, OR
      1 c  Orange Peels; Chopped, Etc.
 
  ~------------------------------OPTIONALS
  ~-------------------------------- NOTE:  TO PREWARM A CANDY
  THERMOMETER, SIMPLE PLACE IT AN A SMALL SAUCE PAN OF COLD WATER AND
  BRING IT TO A BOIL.  LET IT SIMMER UNTIL YOU NEED THE THERMOMETER.
  STEP 1: Prewarm the thermometer; separate the eggs allowing the
  whites to come to room temperature in a large bowl of an electric
  mixer.  (Return the egg yolks to the refrigerator covering with
  plastic wrap or water for another recipe.) Fill a glass with ice
  cubes and water. To make dropped divinities, you will need 2 cookie
  sheets, topped with greased wax paper. For squares, use a greased and
  wax paper-lined 8 X 8-inch pan.  Measure the sugar, corn syrup, ice
  water and salt and dump into a heavy 2-quart saucepan with a tight
  fitting lid. STEP 2: Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a
  wooden spoon over low heat.
   Syrup will become clear, gritty sounds will cease, and the spoon will
  glide smoothly over the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat to
  medium and bring to a boil. STEP 3: (OPTIONAL): Cover pan with a
  square of wax paper and lid, pushing down firmly.  Steam for 2 to 3
  minutes to dissolve the sugar crystals.  (Listen to make sure the pot
  doesn't boil over. To double-check, remove lid, leaving the wax paper
  in place.) STEP 4: Wash down any crystals clinging to the sides with
  a brush dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath. Introduce the
  prewarmed thermometer. No need to stir. STEP 5:  Beat the egg whites
  until stiff but not dry. If your mixer is a heavy duty one, you can
  wait until the bubbles in the syrup become very large and airy before
  beating the egg whites. Otherwise, do it now when the thermometer
  registers 240 Degrees F. (115.5 C.). STEP 6: Test the syrup when the
  thermometer registers 246 degrees F. (119 C.). Continue testing until
  it reach the firm-ball stage, 246 to 260 degrees F. (119 to 126.5
  C.). Syrup will be hard to scrape up in ice water.
   It will have to be forced into a ball, but once formed, it should
  hold its shape but give under pressure. Return the thermometer to the
  hot water bath to soak clean. STEP 7:  Dribble the syrup into the egg
  whites in a slow, steady stream, beating at slow speed. Tilt the
  syrup pan to get the last drop but do not scrape the pan. Once the
  syrup is completely incorporated, change to a flat whip if you have
  one. STEP 8: Have patience and continue beating.
   The amount of time you spend mixing depends on the power of your
  mixer. If you have a heavy duty or commercial one, you can go to full
  speed and make the divinity in less than 5 minutes. With less
  powerful ones, it can take up to 20 minutes. The important thing is
  to beat at the highest speed of your mixer.
   Also if it is a hot and humid day, it will take longer also. STEP 9:
  Test the divinity.  The first and most important test occurs when you
  lift the beaters.  If the candy falls back in ribbons that
  immediately merge back into the batter, it isn't done.
   Eventually, a stationary column will form between the beaters and the
  bowl.  Candy will lose its sheen/gloss and stop being sticky; a
  teaspoonful dropped onto wax paper will hold its shape, even a peak.
  If you machine is laboring and the candy is not quite there yet, you
  have two choices: Pour anyway and put into a frost free freezer to
  set up....or finish by hand. STEP 10:  Fold in the flavorings and
  nuts and/or other optional items using the mixer or if very thick, a
  wooden spoon. STEP 11: Drop or spread the divinity either on wax
  paper-covered cookie sheets or the buttered pan. Dripping it by
  teaspoon is harder work for you but it ripens quicker and is ready to
  eat sooner. A neat trick is to put the candy into a pastry bag and
  pipe onto the wax paper.  If you spread it in the pan, you will have
  to wait up to 24 hours before it is ready. But you maybe one of those
  that think it is better when it is 24 hours old.  Score and cut into
  squares. Store in an airtight container at room temperature or in a
  refrigerator. Makes 1 pound but looks like more. Recipe CANNOT be
  doubled; it can be frozen but not for extended periods of time.

 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
           -sifted
    3/4 ts Salt
      3 lg Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Extra-virgin olive oil
 
  Recipe by: The Ultimate Pasta Machine Cookbook Following the
  instructions given in your owner's manual, prepare and set up the
  pasta machine with an extruder die to make the desired shape of pasta.
  
  All ingredients must be at room temperature.  Place the liquid
  ingredients in a glass measuring cup.  If less than 3/4 cup, add some
  water to make up the balance.
  
  Add the dry ingredients to the pasta machine mixing bowl. Switch the
  pasta machine on.  Slowly pour the liquid ingredients through the
  feed tube. Mix for approximately 3 minutes, or until the dough
  appears to be coming together in soft pea-sized crumbs.
  
  Following the instructions given in your owners' manual, begin to
  extrude the dough.  Cut off the first 2 to 3 inches extruded and
  discard. As the pasta begins to come out, gently move it away from
  the machine. Cut with a sharp knife or scissors at desired lengths.
  Place extruded pasta on a wire rack or on a clean kitchen cloth. Let
  sit for at least 30 minutes before cooking, or store for later use.

      Title: BASIC EGG PASTA DOUGH
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      6    Eggs
 
  Recipe by: Northern Italian Cooking Put flour on a pastry board and
  make a well in the center. Break the eggs into well; beat with a
  fork. Draw some flour from inner rim of well over eggs, beating
  constantly. Keep adding flour a little at a time until you have a
  soft dough. Put dough aside. With a pastry scraper, remove bits and
  pieces of dough attached to board. Lightly flour board and your
  hands. Knead dough 10 to 12 minutes, adding flour a little at a time
  until dough is smooth and pliable. Insert a finger into center of
  dough.  If it comes out almost dry, dough is ready for pasta machine.
  If dough is sticky, knead it a little longer adding more flour. Cut
  an egg-size piece from dough.  Wrap remaining dough in a cloth towel
  to prevent it from drying. Set rollers of pasta machine at their
  widest setting.  Flatten small piece of dough, dust with flour and
  fold in half. Run it through pasta machine. Repeat this step 5 to 8
  times until dough is smooth and not sticky. Change notch of pasta
  machine to the next setting and run dough through once without
  folding. Keep changing setting and working pasta sheet through
  machine until pasta reaches desired thickness. A good thickness for
  general use is about 1/16 inch. Sprinkle dough with flour between
  rollings if it is sticky.

      Title: BASIC EGG-PASTA RECIPE
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           -Flour
      1    Egg
 
  Combine the flour and egg in the mixing bowl of a food processor
  fitted with a steel blade.Process for a few minutes.The dough will
  look very granular,like yellow-colored,uncooked cream of wheat.Pinch
  the dough.It should stock together.If it does not stick,mix in a bit
  of oil or water. Form a ball with the dough and knead for a few
  minutes on a lightly floured board.It will become smooth and
  hard(much harder than bread dough).In a few minutes,the dough should
  look satiny and smooth.Wrap it in plastic and let rest for about 30
  minutes. Then roll out the dough through a pasta roller or by
  hand.Sprinkle additional flour on the dough as needed to prevent
  sticking.The dough is quite forgiving and can be handled easily. When
  the rolled-out pasta sheet feels dry,not sticky,cut into noodles by
  hand or with the machine. If you have a pasta drying rack,hang the
  cut pasta on the rack.If not,wrap the noodles around your hand to
  form a nest and set it on a lightly floured board.Toss with flour on
  occasion to allow the pasta to dry evenly. Fresh pasta cooks
  quickly.Add it to boiling water and test a strand every 15 seconds
  until done. Sometimes,I vary this recipe by adding 1 1/2 tsp. of
  olive oil and up to 1 tbsp. of a flavoring ingredient,such as minced
  fresh herbs or garlic,tomato paste or pureed beets. Keeping the same
  proportions of 1 egg to 3/4 cup flour,the recipe can be multiplied as
  many times as needed.A 1 egg recipe will feed 1 or 2 people for a
  main course;a 2 egg recipe feeds 2 to 3.An average size food
  processor will handle a 3 egg recipe easily.If you need to make
  more,it is a good idea to make several batches.

  lightly with cornmeal. Add muffins, about 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with
  additional cornmeal.  Cover; let rise until double, about 45 minutes.
  Heat lightly greased griddle or heavy skillet. With wide spatula
  carefully remove muffins (do not compress or puncture or they will
  collapse) to griddle.  Bake over very low heat 8 to 10 minutes on
  each side until light brown. (Muffins should sound hollow when
  tapped) Cool on racks. To serve, split with fork tines; toast.

           Lemon juice or any sauce
           -- for asparagus
 
  Tatum writes: "The young, tender, tightly curled fronds - croziers or
  fiddleheads - of bracken (or brake ferns) and of ostrich and cinnamon
  ferns are all prepared in the same way.
  
  "Rub off the fuzz (or, for some ferns, the scaly coating) of the
  young, crisp fronds, wash them and place them, lying flat, in a
  saucepan or skillet with a small amount of boiling salted water.
  Bring water again to a boil.  Turn to low heat, cover and simmer for
  10 to 20 minutes, or until fronds are just tender (time will depend
  on the size and kind of fronds)."
  
  Season with butter, salt and pepper to taste, or serve with lemon
  juice of any sauce suitable for asparagus.

 Categories: Low fat, Cereals
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6    8 C oats
      1 c  (approx) concentrated fruit
           Juice
      1 tb Cinnamon
           Raisins
 
  Mix it up in a large bowl, then spread into a jelly-roll type pan.
  Bake at 250 F until done, an hour or so, stirring occasionally. Pour
  the warm granola back into the mixing bowl and gently fold in dried
  fruit. When cool, store in an airtight container.
  
  That's the basic recipe, but it's easy to modify. Here are things I
  substitute or add:
  
  honey, nutmeg, maple syrup, Smuckers syrup, amaranth seeds, oat bran,
  rye flakes, craisins, dried apricots.
  
  Here are a few baking tricks:
  
  * Don't overcook it. You'll end up with a pan-o-pebbles. Bake only
  until "al dente". * It's less messy (with all that stirring) to use a
  pan with high sides. * zip lock bags make good storage containers.

      Title: BASIC FONDUE (FONDUE NEUCHATELOISE)
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 fl Dry white wine
           Clove garlic
  5 1/2 oz Emmental and Gruyere cheese*
      1 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 fl Kirsch**
           Shake pepper
           Grind fresh nutmeg
      6 oz White bread, cubed
 
  (Note:  the above measurements are for *each* person.
   Multiply by your number of guests.)
  
  * Grated and mixed half and half.  ** This is Swiss cherry firewater:
  clear, dry-tasting -- *not* "cherry brandy", which is dark and sweet.
  
  Most good liquor stores should carry it, at least one of the US
  brands like Hiram Walker, or else maybe Bols. The best Kirsch is
  "Etter" brand from Switzerland, but the odds of your finding it are
  minuscule. -- In Switzerland, fondue is usually perpared in a
  "caquelon", an earthenware dish with a handle, glazed inside; but any
  enamelled saucepan can be used, or a not too shallow fireproof dish.
  Rub the inside of the pan with half a cut clove of garlic, and let it
  dry until the rubbed places feel tacky. Put the wine in the dish and
  bring it to a boil. Slowly start adding cheese to the boiling wine,
  and stir constantly until each bit is dissolved, then add more.  When
  all the cheese is in, stir the kirsch into the cornstarch well, then
  add the mixture to the cheese and keep stirring over the heat until
  the mixture comes to a boil again. Add freshly ground pepper and
  nutmeg to taste.  -- Remove the dish to on top of a small live flame
  (Sterno or alcohol burner) and keep it bubbling slowly. Bread should
  have been cubed ~- about 1-inch cubes -- for spearing with fondue
  forks and stirring around in the cheese.  The old custom is that if
  you accidentally lose the bread into the cheese from the end of your
  fork, if you're male, you have to buy a round of drinks for the
  table: if you're female, you have to kiss everybody. (Hmm.) .
  
  Other fondue info:  Do not drink water with fondue -- it reacts
  unkindly in your stomach with the cheese and bread. Dry white wine or
  tea are the usual accompaniments.  Another tradition:  the "coupe
  d'midi", or "shot in the middle", for when you get full: a thimbleful
  of Kirsch, knocked straight back in the middle of the meal, usually
  magically produces more room if you're feeling too full. Don't ask me
  how this works...it just does. -- The crusty bit that forms at the
  bottom of the pot as the cheese keeps cooking is called the
  "crouton", and is very nice peeled off and divvied up among the
  guests as a sort of farewell to dinner.

      Title: BASIC FRUIT JELLY RECIPE
 Categories: Confections, Christmas
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      1 lb Plus 2 oz fruit pulp
           (cup measurements are given
           With specific recipes)
           Syrup from canned fruits
           (used only with certain
           Fruits- see specific recipes
      3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Liquid, pectin-based,
           Jelling agent (Certo)
 
  PREPARING THE FRUIT:Wash, peel and seed the fruit if necessary. Most
  fruits are then pureed (see instructions given with specific
  recipes). Some fruits are used as they are and others are mixed with
  syrup from canned fruit. Because of their relatively neutral taste,
  peach and apricot syrups are best. They can even be mixed together.
  PREPARING THE MOLD AND JELLING AGENT: Line a small brownie
  pan(8x8x2-in.) with parchment paper. If using the jelling agent in a
  bottle, simply open the bottle; if using pouches, cut them open and
  stand them upright in a large jar or measuring cup so that they will
  be ready to use. COOKING THE FRUIT JELLY: In a large heavy-bottomed
  saucepan, place the fruit pulp or the fruit pulp-syrup mixture and
  the sugar. Bring to a rapid boil over high heat, stirring constantly
  with a wooden spatula. Once a full rolling boil is reached start the
  cooking time; this will be from 4 to 9 minutes, always at a rapid
  boil and stirring constantly, depending on the fruit used (specific
  cooking times are given in specific recipes). Add the butter halfway
  through the cooking time. When it is time, remove the saucepan from
  the heat and immediatly add the liquid jelling agent; stir vegorously
  for a few seconds to be sure that it is completely mixed into the
  jelly mixture. TO MOLD, CUT AND SERVE THE FRUIT JELLIES: As soon as
  the jelling agent has been stirred in, pour the boiling hot fruit
  jelly into the brownie pan. Allow to set and cool completely, which
  will thke at least 2 to 3 hours. When the jelly is completely cold,
  run the blade of a knife all around the edge of the pan. Unmold and
  remove the paper; then cut it into squares about 3/4 inch on a side.
  Roll the squares one at a time in granulated sugar (preferably large
  grained). This step is not absolutely necessary; it does, however,
  keep the jellies from sticking to one another if piled on top of each
  other when served, and makes them more attractive. The fruit jellies
  can be placed in individual paper cases and served in a wooden box or
  a basket, or they can simply be piled on top of each other on a
  plate. TO STORE: The uncut jellies will keep for two months wrapped
  in the nonstick parchment paper it is molded on, placed in a box and
  kept in a cool cellar or refrigerator. If kept in a refrigerator the
  jelly picks up a little moisture but keeps its shine better. Once cut
  and rolled in sugar, the jellies will keep for a week in a closed
  container in the refrigerator. It is preferable to place them in
  individual paper cases if they are to be stored this way, to keep
  them from sticking together. These homemade fruit jellies are much
  softer than commercial ones.

      Title: BASIC GUIDELINES FOR MAKING VEGETABLE STOCK
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 qt Cold water
      8 c  Vegetables -- cut into 1"
           Pieces
 
  First choose the ingredients to reflect the soup in which the broth is
  being used. A general guideline for making vegetable broth is to use
  about 8 to 12 cups of vegetables cut into pieces no bigger than 1
  inch. Put these with 2 quarts of cold water in a large nonreactive
  pot with no more than six different herbs. Bring to a boil over high
  heat, then lower the heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Strain and
  use as is or concentarte the flavor by simmering to the desired
  strength (by taste).
  
  When using dried herbs, lessen quantities by one-half to two-thirds
  but always add *to taste*
  
  vegetable: carrots, celery, potatoes, winter squash, summer squash,
  chard, kale, tomatoes, mushrooms, eggplant, lettuce, green beans,
  celeriac When available use: fennel bulbs, asparagus, peas herbs
  (limit 6): basil, bay, borage, garlic, garlic chives, hyssop, lovage,
  morjoram, oregano, parsley, sage, savory, thyme spices (limit 2)
  coriander, cumin, cardamon, fennel seeds, whole cloves, cinnamon

  NOTES : Stock is very personal. It's quickly prepared. Or make ahead
  and freeze in a size that's convenient for you. -- Maggie Cabbage
  family vegetables were left off the list of ingredients because they
  give a strong (dominant) flavor; the flavor grows stronger (ages in
  the freezer). If you like, use mild cabbages: napa, bok choy, a
  little savoy, young brussels. Or use chard and endive. When using
  cabbage, try to use the broth right away. Also, straining is
  important.  Use a very fine sieve. -- Maggie and patH

      1    Garlic clove
      2 tb Oil
      1 tb Sherry
    1/2 c  Stock (chicken)
 
  Soak dried mushrooms. Slice roast pork, celery, cabbage and bamboo
  shoots. Blanch bean sprouts. Stem snow peas. Shred ginger root and
  crush garlic. Heat oil. Add ginger root and garlic; stir fry to brown
  lightly. Add pork and stir fry a few times. Then add in sherry to
  blend. Add all vegetables except snow peas and stir fry 1 minute
  more. Add stock and heat quickly. Then cook,covered, 3 minutes over
  medium heat. Stir in snow peas. Combine mixture with tossed noodles
  (*See below) Variations: Substitute cooked beef,ham, chicken, duck,
  crabmeat, lobster or shrimp. You can also add shredded green onion to
  the garlic/ginger mixture. I use Shaoxing wine instead of sherry,
  which is more authentic. *To cook noodles, prepare boiling water with
  a little salt. Add noodles and cook until barely done. Drain and
  rinse with cold water to stop cooking. Separate noodles with a fork,
  then toss them with a little sesame oil or peanut oil and set aside
  until they are ready to go into your stir-fry for the final heat. You
  will want about a pound of noodles for the above recipe. This recipe
  is simply a guideline for a dish that can be varied in a thousand
  ways!

MMMMM------------------BASIC BISCUIT BAKING MIX-----------------------
      9 c  Flour; sifted
    1/3 c  Baking Powder; double
           -acting
      1 c  Nonfat Dry Milk plus
      2 tb Nonfat Dry Milk
      4 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Vegetable Shortening
 
  Stir baking powder, dry milk and salt into the sifted flour. Sift all
  dry ingredients together until well mixed. Cut or mix fat into flour
  mixture utnil all particles are thouroughly coated and mixture
  esembels coarse cornmeal. Sotre mix in a jar or can with a tight lid.
  It can be measured into 2 cup amounts and put in plastic bags or
  jarsd where it will be ready for use. It may be stored at room
  temperature for 6 weeks. Vary the liquids: dry milk solids are
  already in the mix so more milk is not need. You can use fruit juice,
  water or meat broth for the liquid called for in a recipe.
  
  The recipes in this Pick-A-pocket book were written for commercial
  packaged baking mix which has no milk so it is the liquid called for
  in recipes. This mix is a perfect substitte. Just use water where it
  calls for milk. (written out of my cookbook)
  
  Basic biscuits: 2 cups mix, 1/2 cup water. Add water to mix and stir
  20-25 times. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10-15
  times. Roll to 1/2" thickness and cut with a knife to pockets shapes
  or use biscuit cutter to make circles. Place in preheated sm and bake
  5 minutes or until golden brown.
  
  Sausage biscuits: 2 1/4 cups packaged biscuit baking mix(milk), 8
  links sausages cooked.
  
  Prepare biscuits according to package directions for rolled biscuits.
  Knead dough, roll out on floured surface and cut 8 circles with a
  biscuit cutter. Lay one sausage in center of each and wrap dough
  around, pinching to seal. Sausages will stick out the ends. Bake 5
  minutes or until golden brown.
  
  Jelly biscuits: flatten unbaked biscuits with heel of your hand.
  Place 1/2 teaspoon jelly or preserves in center. Fold over and pinch
  edges together to seal. Bake 5 minutes or till golden.

      Title: BASIC PANCAKES
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -==============
 
  Ingredients:
  
  2 cups   flour 3 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp salt (very important) 1/4
  cup sugar 2 eggs (or equivalent egg beaters) 2 tblsp oil 1 cup milk
  Sift (I never do) dry ingredients in bowl and stir in liquid
  ingredients with wire whisk or spoon until mixed.  Do not beat. Rub
  griddle or fry pan with oil. Heat until water dropped from your hand
  bounces around. Drop about 1/2 ladel/1 large mixing spoon for each
  pancake.  Cook until bubbled all over the top and brown on bottom.
  Flip, cook until brown on other side. Keep you griddle very hot at
  all times.
  
  Variations:
  
  1. Substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour for white flour.
  
  2.  Substitute buttermilk for whole milk and 1 tsp baking SODA for
  1/2 tsp baking powder.
  
  3.  Put some pecan or walnut pieces in with your dry ingredients (this
  keeps them from sinking).  Or put in some blueberries .. also with dry
  ingredients.
  
  4.  Increase your eggs.  This will make them a little more like a
  crepe. Top with sliced apples, brown sugar and cinnamon and fold in
  half.

      Title: BASIC PASTA DOUGH
 Categories: Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 36 Large dump
 
      4 c  Sifted flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Oil
      4    Eggs
      6 tb Very cold water
 
  In a large bowl mix the flour and salt. Make a well in center of
  flour. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing slightly after each addition.
  Add gradually the water and oil. Mix well to make a stiff dough. Turn
  dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 3 to 5 minutes
  until smooth and elastic. Divide dough into fourths. Lightly roll
  each portion 1/8" thick and cut lengthwise into 5" wide strips. Use
  the strips immediately, do not allow to dry. Place 2 teaspoons of
  whatever filling you are using 1 1/2 " from the narrow end and in the
  center of the strip. Continue along the strip, placing the filling at
  3" intervals. Fold the strip in half lengthwise, covering the mounds
  of filling. To seal, press the edges together with the tines of a
  fork. Press gently between the mounds to form rectangles 3" long. Cut
  apart with a pastry cutter and press the cut edges with the tines of
  a fork to seal. Let the ravioli dry for about 2 hrs. Then in a large
  saucepan bring to a boil: 7 quarts water with 2 Tb salt. Gradually
  add the ravioli. Boil rapidly, uncovered, about 10 min or until
  tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain. Place on a warm
  platter and top with a sauce.

      Title: BASIC PIE CRUST
 Categories: Pies, Misc
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
           - well chilled or frozen
      1 lg Egg yolk
      5 tb Ice water
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
 
  CUT THE BUTTER into tablespoon-size pieces. Put in a food processor
  and chop by pulsing the machine on and off about 6 times. Add the egg
  yolk, water and salt and process until the ingredients are mixed,
  about 5 seconds. The butter should still be in little pieces. Add the
  flour and process just until the ingredients begin to clump together.
  Stop processing before a ball forms, or even begins to form. Transfer
  the dough to a large plastic bag. Working through the bag, press the
  dough into a ball, then flatten into a disc, about 8 inches wide. If
  you are using the dough right away, it must be chilled enough to firm
  it before rolling. Place it in the refrigerator or freezer just until
  it is firm but not hard. The dough can also be refrigerated for up to
  2 days or frozen. If so, let stand at room temperature until softened
  enough to roll without splitting. 15 minutes before baking, place the
  rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400F. Have
  ready the pie plate or tart pan you will be using. Roll the dough on
  a floured board to a circle about 1/8-to-1/16-inch thick. Lift the
  dough several times and brush the board with flour to keep the dough
  from sticking. Lightly fold the dough in half, then in quarters. Lift
  to the pie plate or tart pan and position it with the point in the
  center. Unfold and ease it into the bottom and sides of the pan. Do
  not stretch the dough. Leave about 3/4 inch of dough beyond the upper
  edge of the pan and trim the excess. Fold the overlap so there is a
  double thickness of dough around the sides. Crimp the edge to make a
  decorative border. Prick the dough with a fork at random, so steam
  can escape. Refrigerate or freeze briefly, to firm the dough. For a
  pre-baked shell, line the pastry with aluminum foil and fill the foil
  with dried beans or rice to weight the pastry. Place on a baking
  sheet for easier handling. Bake for 14 minutes. Remove the foil with
  the beans or rice. (The beans or rice can be used over again as
  weights.) Prick pastry again, and bake until it is lightly colored,
  10 to 14 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack before filling. Sweet
  Variation: Add 2 tablespoons sugar to the work bowl with the butter.
  Decrease the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. Makes 1 Crust

 Categories: Bakery, Oriental, Breads
      Yield: 24 Small pita
 
      2 c  Warm water
      2 tb Yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      5 c  White flour
 
  Pour water into a large bowl & add yeast.  Stir & add the sugar &
  salt. Gradually add the flour, stirring constantly until the mixture
  is smooth. Work in another 1/2 cup of flour with your hands, kneading
  as you go, until the dough is no longer sticky.  Knead on a board for
  another 5 minutes. Shape dough into a rectangle. Cut it in half,
  lengthwise, & divide into 24 portions (or make 12 large pitas).
  Shape each portion into a smooth ball & place each ball on a floured
  surface. Cover with a damp cloth. Press each ball flat.  With a
  rolling pin, roll each round from the centre out turning the dough
  1/4 revolution each roll. A small pita should be 5 to 5 1/2" in
  diameter & 1/4" thick. (Large ones should be 8" in diameter). Flip
  pitas over & smooth out any creases. 15 minutes before loaves have
  finished rising, preheat oven to 500F & warm an ungreased baking
  sheet. As each loaf is rolled, place it on a floured surface, cover
  with a dry clean towel & let rise for 30 to 45 minutes.  Place pitas
  on the hot baking sheet. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven until
  puffed & lightly browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes for small
  ones & 3 1/2 for large ones. If desired, flip the pita over to brown
  on the other side. Remove from oven, wrap in dry towels until cool
  enough to handle. Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Title: BASIC PIZZA CRUST
 Categories: Pizza
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 tb Sugar
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water (105 deg.F. to
           -115 deg.F.)
      3 c  All-purpose flour, divided
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Olive oil
           Vegetable cooking spray
      1 tb Cornmeal
 
  Basic Pizza Crust
  
  From:  Cooking Light magazine, Sept./Oct. 1991 issue
  
  Dissolve sugar and yeast in 1 cup warm water in a large bowl; let
  stand 5 minutes.  Stir in 2 3/4 cups flour, salt, and oil to form a
  soft dough.
  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth and
  elastic (about 5 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1
  Tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands.
  
  Place dough in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning dough to
  coat top. Cover dough and let rise in a warm place (85 deg.F.), free
  from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch dough down, and divide in half.  Roll each half of dough into a
  12 inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Place dough on 12-inch
  pizza pans or baking sheets coated with cooking spray and each
  sprinkled with 1/2 Tablespoon cornmeal.  Crimp edges of dough with
  fingers to form a rim. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85
  deg.F.), free from drafts, 30 minutes. Top and bake according to
  recipe directions. Yield: 2 (12-inch) pizza crusts (about 720
  calories each).
  
  Note:  Store half of dough in freezer up to 1 month, if desired. Let
  dough rise; punch down, and divide in half. Dust half with flour,
  wrap in plastic wrap, and store in a zip-top heavy-duty plastic bag
  in freezer. To thaw, place dough in refrigerator 12 hours or
  overnight; bring to room temperature, and shape as desired.

      Title: BASIC PIZZA DOUGH
 Categories: Italian, Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  4 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           White flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      2 pk Dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
      2 ts Light brown sugar
 
  Measure 1/2 cup warm water (110 F) into 2 cup container and stir in
  the brown sugar.  (Make sure water is warm, not hot - too hot will
  kill the yeast).  Dissolve the 2 packages of dried yeast in the water
  and set it aside for 5 minutes.  Will become frothy. (about 2 cups
  worth!)
  
  Sift 4 cups of the flour and the salt into a large mixing bowl.  Make
  a depression in the middle of the flour and pour in 3/4 of the olive
  oil and 1 cup of warm water.  When the yeast is ready, add it also.
  
  Dust your kneading surface with flour, then mix the ingredients in
  the bowl with your hands.  Place dough ball on the floured surface
  and knead from 8 to 10 minutes.  Add flour to the kneading surface if
  the dough is too sticky or wet.  Eventually the dough will become
  elastic.
  
  Rub the insides of a clean bowl with the remaining olive oil and
  place the dough in it, coating the dough with olive oil by turning it
  in the bowl. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise in warm,
  draft-free place until double in size, 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours.  An
  oven with the light on or a lit burner pilot will provide suitable
  heat for rising dough.
  
  When dough has risen, divide into two halves, then roll each out on
  floured surface.  A round shape may be cut out with table knife using
  12" bowl or plate as template.
  
  Sufficient for 2 12" thin-crust pizzas, or 1 12" thick-crust.
  
  HINT: Before filling and baking, form rim around outer ring of pizza
  dough to hold ingredients better.  Brush the inside area of the
  dough, not the rim, with olive oil and let the dough sit in a warm
  place and rise a little before filling.  Then spoon in sauce, cover
  with 1 lb. mozzarella cheese, add meat toppings, then cover with
  mozzarella/parmesan mixture of cheese. Then brush rim of pizza crust
  with olive oil. Sprinkle the pizza pan or oven tiles with cornmeal to
  prevent pizza from sticking to cooking surface!
  
  THE VERY BEST:  Cook on a pizza stone or oven tile at 500 F.   The
  unglazed oven tile makes a huge difference in the crispiness and
  texture of the crust. It absorbs moisture and keeps oven temperatures
  even. May even be removed with pizza and set on a rack on table -
  will keep pizza warm much longer.

      Title: BASIC PIZZA DOUGH (SLOMON)
 Categories: Pizzas
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Warm tap water (110 to 115
           -degrees)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      3    To 3 1/2 cups flour
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  1.  Pour the water into a medium-sized mixing bowl and sprinkle in the
  yeast. Stir gently with a fork until the yeast has dissolved and the
  liquid turns light beige in color.
  
  2.  Add 1 cup of the flour and the salt.  Mix thoroughly with a wooden
  spoon.  Add a second cup of flour to the bowl and mix well. After the
  second cup of flour has been mixed in, the dough should start coming
  away from the sides of the bowl and should begin to form a
  soft,sticky mass.
  
  3.  Measure out the third cup of flour.  Sprinkle some over the work
  surface and flour your hands generously. Remove all of the dough from
  the bowl and begin to work the mass by kneading the additional flour
  in a bit at a time.
  
  4.  To knead the dough, use the heel of your hands to push the dough
  across the floured work surface in one sweep. Clench the dough in
  your fist and twist and fold it over. Use the dough scraper to help
  gather the wet dough that sticks to the work surface into a ball
  while kneading. Repeat this action over and over again, adding only
  as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your
  hands. Work quickly and don't be delicate. Slap and push the dough
  around to develop its gluten and to facilitate its rolling out.
  (Kneading pizza dough is a great way to relieve pent-up aggression!)
  
  5.  When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand
  down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds. This will test its
  readiness;if your hand comes up clean, the dough is done. If it
  sticks, a bit more kneading will be necessary. Once the dough is no
  longer sticky, do not overwork it by adding more flour. Continue
  kneading only until the dough is smooth and elastic (it should spring
  back when pressed) and no lines of raw white flour show.  The whole
  process should take 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  6.  Lightly oil a 2 quart bowl with vegetable oil. Roll the ball of
  dough around in the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil. Tightly
  seal the bowl with plastic wrap to trap in the moisture and heat from
  the yeast's carbon dioxide gases.  This will help the dough rise
  faster.
  
  7.  Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free place.  Let the dough rise
  for 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  8.  Once the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down by pushing your
  fist into it.  All of the gases will quickly escape, and the dough
  will collapse. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it again for
  about 1 minute.
  
  9.  The dough is now ready to be patted and rolled into pizza, or to
  undergo additional rising.
  
  10. To raise dough a second time, add a bit more oil to the bowl and
  repeat the procedure indicated for the first rising. Then the dough
  is ready to be shaped.

      Title: BASIC POLENTA
 Categories: Italian, Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      9 c  Water
      1 tb Salt
      3 c  Cornmeal; coarse-grain
 
  Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time:
  :40 Bring water to a boil in a large heavy pot. Add salt and reduce
  heat until water is simmering. Take cornmeal by the handful and add
  to water very slowly, controlling the flow to a thin stream through
  your fingers. To avoid lumps, stir quickly with a long handled wooden
  spoon while adding cornmeal.  If necessary, stop adding cornmeal from
  time to time and beat mixture vigorously.  Cook, stirring constantly,
  20 to 30 minutes. Polenta will become very thick while cooking. It is
  done when it comes away cleanly from the sides of the pot.  Pour
  polenta into a large wooden board or a large platter. Wet your hands
  and smooth out polenta evenly, about 2 inches thick.  Let cool 5 to
  10 minutes or until polenta solidifies. Cut cooled polenta into
  slices 1 inch wide and 6 inches long. Place slices in individual
  dishes. Serve hot, covered with your favorite sauce. Makes 6 to 8
  servings. Variation: Fried Polenta (Polenta Fritta): Prepare polenta
  and let cool completely.  Cut cooled polenta into slices 2 inches
  wide and 6 inches long. Pour oil about 1 inch deep in a large
  skillet. Heat oil until a 1-inch cube of bread turns golden almost
  immediately. Fry polenta slices on both sides until light golden.
  Drain on paper towels. Serve hot. It is importent to insure the oil
  is hot enough, otherwise the polenta will absorb oil and your polenta
  will be greasy and unpalatable.

      Title: BASIC POTATO DUMPLINGS
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 md Potatoes
      1    Egg Yolk
      1 tb Salt
      2 c  All-Purpose Flour, Up To
           - 2-1/2 Cups
      1 tb Vegetable Oil
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
 
  Puncture potatoes in several places with a fork.  Bake 1 hour in a
  350F oven or until tender.  Remove and discard skins. Mash potatoes
  through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl, and let cool a
  little. Add egg yolk, salt, and 2 cups flour.  Mix well.  Knead dough
  on work surface or board into a ball.  It should be soft and a little
  sticky. If it's too sticky, add a little flour. Lightly flour surface
  and hands. Break dough into egg-size pieces.  Roll until thickness of
  thumb. Cut roll into 1-inch pieces. Push each Gnocchi against the
  back of a fork to imprint a pattern. This helps them absorb more
  sauce (and makes them a little prettier). Arrange them on a floured
  tray. Fill a large saucepan 2/3 full with salted water.  Bring to a
  boil.  Add oil and dumplings. Stir, to make sure they don't stick t
  bottom. When they come to surface, let them cook 10-12 seconds more.
  Remove with a slotted spoon as they are done. They get soggy if
  overcooked (they absorb more moisture than regular pasta). Serve with
  butter and Parmesan cheese or your favorite sauce.

           ---- CHICKEN BREAST ------
      2 tb Raw brown rice
      1 tb Brown sugar
      4    Whole cloves
           Tea leaves from 2 earl Grey
           - tea bags, removed from

    1/4 ts Olive oil
      2    6oz boneless skinless
           - chicken breasts
 
  Take 3 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil 15 inches square and start
  rolling the edges under to from a circle that fits in the bottom of
  your Dutch oven -- in our case, a foil saucer approximately 5 inches
  in diamerter.  When the edge is rolled to about 1 inch high, stop and
  flatten it. Then, depress the center to hold the smoke ingredients.
  
  In the depression of the aluminum foil saucer first sprinkle the
  rice, then the sugar, cloves and the contents of the tea bags. The
  order of ingredients is very important. Place the foil dish in Dutch
  oven, cover tightly and cook over high heat until ingredients in the
  foil start smoking ~- about 5 minutes.
  
  Brush a steamer platform with the olive oil.  Place the chicken on
  platform, skinned side up.  Put into Dutch oven over the smoke
  ingredients, cover and continue smoking over high heat until done --
  about 11 minutes.

      Title: BASIC RECIPE FOR MARSHMALLOWS
 Categories: Snacks
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 pk Gelatin, unflavored
    1/2 c  ;Water, cold
      2 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Corn syrup, light
    3/4 c  ;Water
      2 ts Vanilla
    1/4 c  Sugar, confectioners;
           -mixed with
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
 
  Combine the gelatin and cold water in a large mixing bowl.  Let the
  mixture stand while preparing the sugar syrup.
  
  Lightly oil a two-quart saucepan.  Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and
  three-quarters of a cup of water in the saucepan.  Cook over medium
  heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves.  Cover, and
  bring to a boil.  Remove the cover as soon as the mixture boils;
  cook, without stirring, to 245 F. (firm ball stage).  Remove from the
  heat. Pour the hot syrup slowly into the softened gelatin, combining
  with a mixer. The entire process should take 15 minutes. Add the
  vanilla at the very end of the beating process.  At this point the
  marshmallow mixture should be very light and fluffy.
  
  Lightly oil an 8"x8"x2" pan.  Sprinkle half the confectioners' sugar-
  cornstarch mixture over the bottom; pour the marshmallow mixture over
  this. Chill overnight in the refrigerator.
  
  When you are ready to cut the marshmallows, sprinkle the rest of the
  confectioner's sugar-cornstarch mixture over the top of the
  marshmallow. Lift the entire piece out of the pan onto a cutting
  board. Use very sharp scissors, dipped into cold water periodically,
  to cut the marsh- mallow into one-inch square pieces.  Roll pieces in
  the confectioners' sugar-cornstarch mixture; there will be enough
  left in the bottom of the pan for this step.  Let the marshmallows
  dry on a cooling rack for an hour or two.  Store in an airtight
  container. The marshmallows will stay moist at least three weeks.
  
  This recipe makes 64 one-inch marshmallows or 128 half-inch
  marshmallows.

      Title: BASIC RISOTTO
 Categories: Rice
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
      4 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Onion; yellow minced
      2 c  Rice;Arborio
      6 c  Chicken broth;homemade pref
      4 ts Salt
      2 ds Pepper
           Parmesan cheese
           -freshly grated
 
  Heat butter and oil in 14"X11"x2" dish or large casserole dish,
  uncovered at High for 2 minutes. Add onions and stir to coat. Cook,
  uncovered at high for 4 minutes. Add rice and stir to coat. Cook,
  uncovered for 4 minutes more. Stir in broth (homemade is best; it has
  the best flavour). Cook, uncovered for 12 minutes more. Remove from
  oven. Let stand uncovered for 5 minutes, to let rice absorb remaining
  liquid, stirring several times. Stir in salt, pepper and Parmesan if
  desired.
  
  **Arborio rice is the best rice for Risotto. It is a short grained
  Italian rice; available in grocery stores in cities with large
  Italian populations, Italian food shops and gourmet food stores.
  Using North American rice will not produce the right creamy texture.

      Title: BASIC RISOTTO & SEVERAL VARIATIONS
 Categories: Cooking, Live
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        1 c  Arborio rice
        2 TB pure olive oil
        1 lg onion -- peeled and finely
  :          di
      1/2 c  dry white wine
    2 1/2 c  chicken stock
        2 TB unsalted butter
      1/4 c  freshly grated Parmesan
  :          cheese
        2 TB heavy cream
  
  Pick through the rice to remove any stones or foreign matter, but do
  not wash it before cooking.
  
  Using a large skillet with a heavy bottom, heat the olive oil over
  low eat and saute or "sweat" the onions until translucent, being
  careful not to allow them to color or brown at all.
  
  Add the Arborio rice, stir to coat with the olive oil, and saute with
  the onions to toast each grain of rice, about 7 minutes. This
  toasting process adds the chewy, al dente quality that attracts so
  many people to risotto.
  
  Once the rice is lightly toasted, add the white wine slowly, stirring
  with a wooden spoon. (A wooden spoon is always preferable when making
  risotto, as a metal spoon tends to cut or injure the grains of rice.
  Constant stirring should be avoided for the same reason.)
  
  Preheat the chicken stock just to the boiling point, then have it
  ready at stoveside. After the rice has absorbed the white wine and
  the skillet is nearly dry, add 1 cup stock, stirring occasionally,
  and cook over very low heat until the stock is absorbed. Continue
  adding the stock, 1 cup at a time, until all the stock has been
  absorbed.
  
  (Adding the liquid in stages, instead of all at once, allows the
  grains of rice to expand more fully, adding to the risotto's creamy
  texture.) Once the rice has been added to the pan, the entire cooking
  process will take about 17 to 20 minutes.
  
  After all of the liquid has been added and the rice is chewy yet fully
  cooked, with a creamy texture, add the butter, Parmesan, and heavy
  cream. Stir to combine all the ingredients and serve immediately.
  Yield: 4 servings

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Sourdough starter
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      2 c  Warm water
  3 3/4    To 4-1/4 C flour
      3 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      3 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Cold water
  
  Mix 1 st 3 ingreds. in 3 qt. glass bowl with wooden spoon until
  smooth. Cover; let stand in warm, draft-free place for 8 hours. Add
  3-3/4 C flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and oil to the mixture in
  bowl. Stir with wooden spoon until smooth and flour is completely
  absorbed. (Dough should be just firm enough to gather into a ball. If
  necessary, add remaining 1/2 C flour gradually, stirring until all
  flour is absorbed.) Turn dough onto heavily floured surface; knead
  until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl;
  turn greased side up. Cover; let rise in warm place until double,
  about 1-1/2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when
  touched.) Punch dough down; divide into halves. Shape each half into
  a round,  slightly flat loaf. Do not tear dough by pulling. Place
  loaves in opposite corners of greased cookie sheet. Make three 1/4"
  deep slashes in each loaf. Let rise until double, about 45 minutes.
  Heat oven to 375. Brush loaves with cold water. Place cookie sheet in
  center of oven; it should not touch the sides of the oven. Bake,
  brushing occasionally with water, until loaves sound hollow when
  tapped, about 50 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets; cool on wire
  racks.
  
  Be sure to let dough rise completely both times - it might take
  longer than the estimated times given.

      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Recipe by: Randy Pollak Preparation Time: 4:00 In a large bowl,
  combine starter, water, yeast, sugar, salt, and 1 cup of flour. Set
  aside in warm place for about 15 minutes to proof. Add remaining
  flour and knead dough until smooth and elastic. Cover with bowl and
  allow to double (about 1 1/2 hours). Punch down dough and divide in
  half. Shape dough into two baguettes by first rolling dough into a
  large rectangle, then roll rectangle into loaf (tuck ends underneath
  loaf), place on baking sheet and allow to double again. With a very
  sharp knife, make a slit down each loaf. Bake in a pre-heated
  375-degree oven for 30 minutes, Test for doneness by tapping on loaf;
  it should sound hollow. For a crispy crust, periodically spray water,
  with a hair sprayer, into the oven while loaves are baking. DARK RYE:
  Substitute 3 cups of rye flour for 3 cups of the all purpose flour.
  Add 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds to the batter, along with 1 cup of
  dark molasses, and 2 tablespoons of powdered cocoa. Substitute brown
  sugar for the plain sugar. Reduce water by 1/4 cup. RAISIN-CINNAMON:
  Add 2 slightly beaten eggs to the batter, after proofing. Roll each
  half of dough into a large rectangle. Sprinkle each rectangle with a
  mixture of, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon.
  Sprinkle each half with 1/2 cup of raisins. Carefully roll each
  rectangle as you would to shape a baguette. tuck the ends underneath
  the loaf. Allow to rise until doubled, do not split tops of loaves.
  After baking brush loaves with melted butter. GARLIC-CHEESE: Add 1
  cup of grated parmesan cheese to batter. Mince 6 cloves of garlic,
  add to batter. After splitting tops of loaves, carefully pour 1
  tablespoon of garlic butter on the top of each loaf. For a cheesier
  loaf, before rolling rectangle into baguette, sprinkle with 1/2 cup
  of grated cheddar cheese.

      Title: BASIC STOCK - PRUDHOMME
 Categories: Cajun, Soups
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------BASIC--------------------------------
      2 qt Cold water
      1    Med. onion, (see note)
      1    Large clove garlic (note)
           Bones, excess meat (notes)

MMMMM--------------------FOWL AND GAME STOCKS-------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Backs, necks, bones (notes)

MMMMM--------------------BEEF OR TURTLE STOCK-------------------------
      2 lb Beef shank (see notes)

MMMMM-------------------------PORK STOCK------------------------------
      2 lb Pork neck bones (see notes)

MMMMM-----------------------SEAFOOD STOCK----------------------------
      2 lb Rinsed shrimp heads (notes)
 
  Notes:  To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable trimmings from
  the recipe(s) you are serving, in place of the onion, garlic and
  celery. The recipe calls for the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and
  quartered.
     Also, you may include bones and any excess meat (excluding livers)
  from meat or poultry, or shells or carcasses from seafood, used in
  the recipe(s) you're cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2
  pounds backs, necks and/or bones from chickens, guinea hens, ducks,
  geese, rabbits, etc. FOR BEEF OR TURTLE STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds
  beef shank (preferred) or other beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK:
  1-1/2 to 2 pounds pork neck bones (preferred) or other pork bones.
  FOR SEAFOOD STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds rinsed shrimp heads and/or
  shells, or crawfish heads and/or shells, or crab shells (2-1/2 to 3
  quarts), or rinsed fish carcasses (heads and gills removed), or any
  combination of these. (you can also substitute oyster liquor for all
  or part of seafood stock called for in a recipe). NOTE: If desired,
  you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350F until
  thoroughly browned.
   Then use them to make your basic stock.  (When you brown the bones
  and vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes on the surface,
  which gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color when it dissolves
  in the stock water.) Always start with cold water--enough to cover
  the other stock ingredients.  Place all ingredients in a stock pot or
  a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then gently simmer
  at least 4 hours, preferably 8 (unless directed otherwise in a
  recipe), replenishing the water as needed to keep about 1 quart of
  liquid in the pan. The pot may be uncovered, or set the lid on it
  askew.  Strain, cool and refrigerate until ready to use.  (Note:
  Remember if you are short on time, using a stock simmered 20 to 30
  minutes is far better than using just water in any recipe..) TO MAKE
  A RICH STOCK: Strain the basic stock, then continue simmering until
  evaporation reduces the liquid by half or more. For example, if your
  recipe calls for 1 cup "Rich Stock," start it with at least 2 cups of
  strained basic stock.  (Rich stocks are needed when a sauce requires
  lots of taste but only a limited amount of liquid, for example,
  "Oyster Sauce for Beef." From The Prudhomme Family Cookbook

  floured surface.  Cut into the desired shapes. Place 1 inch apart on
  an ungreased cookie sheet. If desired, sprinkle with candies or
  colord sugar before baking.
  
  Bake in a 375 F oven for 7 to 9 minutes or until the edges are firm
  and the bottoms are very lightly browned. Remove the cookies and cool
  on a rack.
  
  Makes 3 to 4 dozen cookies.
  
  CHOCOLATE SUGAR COOKIES:  Stir 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa
  powder into one half of the recipe. Bake as directed.
  
  NOTE: Sugar cookies also make attractive and economical ornaments.
  Make the dough according to the recipe then flatten the cut out
  cookies slightly with the bottom of a small glass dipped in sugar.
  Use a drinking straw to make a sharp, small hole near the top. If the
  hole begins to close during baking, use the straw to re-form the hole.

      1 c  Very warm water (105 F to

      2 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Instant nonfat dry milk (in

      2 lg Eggs, at room temperature
    1/2 c  Lightly salted butter or

           Temperature
      1 ts Salt
      5 c  All-purpose flour (up to 5
           -1/4 cups)
 
  Combine the water, yeast, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Let stand
  for 2 minutes.
  
  Add the dry milk, eggs, butter, salt, and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Mix
  until smooth, then beat for 2 minutes. Stir in enough of the remaining
  flour to make a soft dough.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface (using some of the
  remaining flour) and knead for 6 to 8 minutes until smooth and
  elastic, adding only as much flour as needed to prevent the dough
  from sticking.
  
  Place the dough in a greased bowl; turn once to bring the greased
  side up. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled
  in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Punch down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Use
  this Basic Sweet Dough to make:
  
  Cinnamon Twist Scandinavian Almond Ring Honey Almond Twist
  
  A delicate, not-too-sweet dough that lends itself admirably to
  toppings and fillings made of fruits, nuts, and spices. It can be
  shaped into twists, rolls, rings, and braids.  Each of the
  accompanying recipes calls for half a recipe of the dough.  Double
  the filling if you wish to make two coffecakes, or make two different
  coffeecakes from one batch of dough. Either way, you can freeze one
  to use later.

      Title: BASIC VEGETABLE PLATTER
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  2 cups soft lettuce leaves (Boston or similar; not iceberg} 1 cup
  fresh mint leaves 1 cup fresh coriander (Chinese parsley) 1 cup
  cucumber *
  
  * peeled in lengthwise strips and with green strips in between, then
  cut in half lengthwise and into thin horizontal slices, forming
  semi-circles.
  
  A salad or vegetable platter is a very important part of a Vietnamese
  meal; indeed, it is served at practically every one. The vegetables,
  which are eaten along with many dishe, are arranged on a platter, and
  diner helps himself to whatever he desires. In Vietnam we used many
  more vegetables and herbs than we can find in the West.  But, in
  spite of that, the following platter makes a satisfactory
  accompaniment to the dishes we have prepared for this book. All
  vegetables and herbs are those served in Vietnam, except that the
  variety is smaller.
  
  Arrange a mound of lettuce in the center of a platter. Around the
  lettuce, and touching it, arrange separate mounds of mint and
  coriander.
  
  Arrange the cucumbers in overlapping slices around the complete outer
  rim of the platter.
  
  This is the basic arrangement of the vegetable platter. On those
  occasions when a recipe calls for another vegetable, it can be added
  to this platter.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: BASIC VEGETABLE SOUP
 Categories: Vegetables, Soups, Healthwise
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 c  Beef broth -- *see note
      2 c  Water
      1 c  Tomato juice
      2    Potatoes -- medium size
      3    Carrots -- diced
      1 sm Onion -- diced
      2    Celery stalks -- diced
    1/4 c  Green peppers -- diced
    1/2 c  Green beans -- chopped
    1/2 c  Lima beans
    1/2 c  Corn
      4 tb Margarine -- solid
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Salt -- or to taste
 
  * Use about 6 cups liquid. You may mix chicken and beef broth (canned
  lowfat, not bouillon cubes) with water and tomato juice or vegetable
  juice cocktail to suit your tastes.
  
  1. Melt 4 tablespoons margarine in skillet. Add the chopped green
  peppers, carrots, celery and onion. Saute on low heat until
  vegetables are softened and onion browned lightly. Add this to the
  broth mixture which has been placed in a large, heavy pan with lid.
  
  2. Add to this the potatoes, green beans, lima beans and corn. Cover
  and simmer for about 45 minutes or until all the vegetables are done.
  Add the salt and pepper.
  
  3. Remove about 2 cups of the mixture and put into blender. Puree this
  mixture and return to pot with rest of soup. Turn off heat and cover
  soup. Best if allowed to set for up to 1 hour to blend flavors. Since
  this is a basic recipe for soup, you can add the vegetables you
  prefer and follow the directions above to finish the soup. Some
  suggestions: Add bay leaf, shredded cabbage, chopped zucchini, diced
  turnips, fresh tomatoes, okra or parsley. For added nutrition, serve
  with a sprinkling of lowfat cheese on the hot soup. Also good
  sprinkled with toasted croutons. This stores very well in
  refrigerator and is actually improved with time.

      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 ts Sugar
      1 c  Warm water
      2 tb Warm water (105F-to-115F)
      3 c  Bread or unbleached flour
           - (bread flour gives a
           - softer texture)
    1/4 c  Non-fat dry milk powder
      2 tb Vegetable oil or margarine
           - softened
      1 ts Salt
           Oil and cornmeal for pan
      1    Egg white; frothed with fork
           - for glaze
 
  STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into water; let stand until foamy, about 5
  minutes. For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with
  dough hook, put remaining bread ingredients into bowl. Turn machine
  on and slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of
  bowl. If dough is too sticky, add more flour by the tablespoon,
  working it in before adding more. If dough is dry and crumbly, add
  more water by the teaspoon, working it in before adding more. Once
  desired consistency is achieved (moist but not too sticky), mix dough
  until well-kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds in
  food processor, or 6 minutes in mixer. If mixing by hand, put
  ingredients into large bowl and make well in center. Pour yeast
  mixture into well and work into ingredients in bowl, then knead on
  floured board until dough is elastic and smooth, about 10 minutes.
  Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal top.
  Place in bowl. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1-to-1 1/2
  hours. Oil 8-cup-capacity bread pan (9-inch). Punch dough down and
  shape to fit pan. Cover loosely with plastic. Let rise in warm spot
  until doubled, about 1 hour. 15 minutes before baking, put rack in
  center of oven; set oven at 375F. When dough has doubled, brush top
  with egg white. Bake until loaf is golden and sounds hollow when
  rapped on bottom, about 35 minutes. Immediately remove loaf

  QUICK MIX METHOD
  
  Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
  Heat milk, water, and 2 tablespoons oil in a saucepan over low heat
  until very warm (120 to 130F). Add liquid to flour mixture; beat on
  high speed of elec- tric mixer until smooth, about 3 minutes.
  Gradually stir in more flour to make a soft dough. Tum onto lightly
  floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (5 to 10 minutes).
  Cover dough with bowl or pan; let rest 20 minutes. For two loaves,
  divide dough in half and roll out two 14x7-inch rectangles; for one
  loaf roll out to 16x8-inch rectangle. Roll up from narrow side,
  pressing dough into roll at each turn. Press ends to seal and fold
  under loaf. Place in 2 greased 8x4x2-inch loaf pans or 1 greased
  9x5x3-inch loaf pan; brush with oil. Let rise in warm place until
  double in bulk (30 to 45 minutes). Bake at 400F 35 to 40 minutes.
  Remove from pans immediately and brush with oil; cool on wire rack.
  
  CONVENTIONAL METHOD
  
  Heat milk, sugar, oil, and salt; cool to lukewarm. In a large bowl,
  sprinkle yeast in warm water (105 to 115F) stir until dissolved. Add
  lukewarm milk mixture and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Beat in
  enough additional flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto lightly
  floured surface; let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Knead until smooth and
  elastic (8 to 10 minutes). Place in a greased bowl, turning to grease
  top. Cover; let rise in warm place until double in bulk (about 1

    1/4 c  Water; warm (110-115 degs)
      2 ts Sugar

  James Beard's Basic White Bread Makes 1 large loaf or 2 small loaves *
  Making basic white bread dough * In a small bowl mix the yeast and
  the 1/4 cup warm water; add the sugar, stir well, and set aside until
  proofed. It is proofed when fermentation is apparent: the mixture
  will swell and small bubbles appear on the surface. (If it doesn't
  proof at all, it means the yeast is not fresh.) In a small saucepan
  heat the milk with the salt and stir in the butter until it melts.
  Set aside to cool until it is no warmer than the yeast mixture. Put 2
  cups of the flour in a large mixing bowl and stir in the milk
  mixture. Beat well with a wooden spatula, add the yeast mixture, and
  continue beating the dough until it is smooth, adding an additional
  cup of flour to make a firm dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured
  work surface and begin the kneading process, which evenly distributes
  the fermenting yeast cells through the dough. * Kneading Instructions
  * There are several kneading methods, but the basic one is to flour
  the dough and your hand lightly, then push the heel of your hand down
  into the dough and away from you. Fold the dough over, give it a
  quarter turn, and push down again. Repeat pushing, folding and
  turning until the motion becomes rhythmic. Knead for about 10
  minutes, kneading in additional flour as necessary, until the dough
  is smooth and no longer sticky, and blisters form on the surface. To
  test whether the dough has been kneaded enough make an indention in
  it with your fingers; it should spring back. If blisters form on the
  surface of the dough and break, this is another sign that the
  kneading is sufficient. * Note: If you have a heavy-duty electric
  mixer with a dough-hook attachment, knead the dough with the hook and
  finish it off on the board. Butter a large bowl, transfer the dough
  to it, and turn the bowl until the dough is well coated with butter
  on all sides. Cover the dough with a dish towel and let it rise in a
  warm, draft-free place for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, until it is doubled in
  bulk. A good, warm, draft-free place is inside your room temperature
  oven. To test further if the dough has risen properly, make an
  indentation in it with two fingers: if the dough does not spring
  back, then it is ready. * Baking Preparations * Butter a 9x5x3 inch
  loaf pan, or two pans that are about 8x4x2 inches. Punch the dough
  down with your fist to deflate it; transfer it to a floured board and
  knead it well for about 3 minutes. Pat it into a smooth round or oval
  shape and let it rest for 4 to 5 minutes. Then form into 1 large or
  two small loaves, by shaping the dough into an oval the length of
  your bread pan, then gently stretching, rounding, and plumping it in
  the palms of your hands, tucking the edges underneath and pinching
  them together. Lift carefully; drop the dough into the pan or pans
  and smooth out. Cover the dough with a towel and let it rise again in
  a warm draft-free place for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until it is
  double in bulk. Preheat the oven to 400dF.  Brush the egg wash over
  the top of the dough. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes;
  reduce the heat to 350dF and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until
  the crust is well browned and the bread sounds hollow when removed
  from the pan and tapped on the bottom with the knuckles. If you like
  a crusty loaf, remove it from the pan about 5 to 10 minutes before
  the end of the baking time and let it finish baking on the oven rack.
  It will get brown and crusty all over. Remove the bread from the oven
  and let it cool on a rack before slicing. The bread may be stored in
  a plastic bag in the refrigerator after it has cooled. If you seal it
  in a bag before it is completely cooled, the crust will become soft.
  Stored bread will keep about 1 week. It also freezes well if wrapped
  tightly in plastic wrap and sealed in a plastic bag and can be kept
  for up to
        3    months.

      Title: BASIC WHITE CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 100 Servings
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
      1 c  Milk
           Salt for the tops (opt.)
 
  Preheat the oven to 325~ F. 325~ F 20 to 25 minutes In a large bowl
  or in the food processor, combine the flour and salt. Cut the butter
  into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Slowly mix in
  enough of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball. If necessary, add up to 1 additional Tablespoon of
  milk. Divide the dough into 3 equal portions for rolling. On a
  floured surface or pastry cloth, roll the crackers paper thin. They
  will look almost translucent. If desired, lightly sprinkle the tops
  with salt and gently roll over the dough with your rolling pin. With
  a sharp knife, carefully cut the crackers into 2-inch squares.
  Handling them gently, transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet.
  Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake
  for 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack.
  Yield: 95-100. VARIATIONS: This basic recipe can be the starting
  point for much interesting experimentation. Simply varying flour or
  liquid can produce an entirely new cracker unavailable anywhere but

      Title: BASIC WHITE SAUCE WITH MILK (BECHAMEL)
 Categories: Sauces, Low fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Nonfat milk
        sm Piece of onion (about 1
           TAB)
      2 tb Grated carrot
    1/8 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/8 ts White pepper
      2 tb Instant nonfat dry milk
      1 tb Cornstarch or arrowroot
      2 tb Flour
 
  In a small saucepan combine milk, onion, carrot, nutmeg and pepper.
  Bring to a boil, then cover, remove from heat and allow to steep for
  ten minutes. Pour the warm milk through a strainer, pressing down on
  the vegetables to obtain all the juices. Let cool. Combine dry milk,
  cornstarch or arrowroot and flour. Add one or two TAB cooled milk to
  the dry mixture and stir to a smooth paste. Return the milk to the
  saucepan, add the flour paste and stir over medium heat until mixture
  boils and thickens. If sauce will not be used immediately, cover and
  refrigerate. Cold sauce will thicken; thin with a little flavored
  cooking juice, wine or stock. Makes about 1 cup; recipe is easily
  doubled.
  
  VVegetables steeped in hot milk add flavor to this versatile sauce,
  which can replace the butter-flour-milk white sauce in any of your
  recipes. It also forms the base of a salt-free cheese sauce that in
  its turn can dress vegetables, open-fac sandwiches, macaroni or baked
  potatoes.

  Swing the right corner away from you and place it on top of the
  dampened left corner.  As you make this fold, simultaneously pull the
  filling toward you with your middle finger. You should finish with a
  little "hat-like" effect.

      Title: BASIC YOGURT CHEESE
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Low or non-fat yogurt
 
  Line a large strainer or colander with two or three layers of fine
  cheesecloth.  Spoon yogurt into   the center of the cloth. Gather the
  corners of the cloth and pull them up. Twist them together to form the
  yogurt into a    tight ball in the center of the cloth. Fasten with a
  twist tie or rubber band near the ball. Tie the remaining long ends of
  cheesecloth to a faucet or cupboard handle so that the whey can drip
  from the cheese.  Let the cheese drip out for at least 6 hours or
  overnight, and be sure you     have a   bowl underneath to catch the
  liquid. The whey is full of nutrients and can be added to soups,
  sauces or vegetable dishes. Put the yogurt ball in a strainer with a
  weight on top to force out even more liquid.                   (A
  plastic bag of dry rice or beans makes a good weight.) Press down on
  the weight occasionally to remove the last bit of whey. Yogurt Cheese
  is ready when it is the solid consistency of cream cheese.
  
        1 8    oz. can crushed pineapple, no sugar added 1 cup Yogurt
  Cheese 1/4 cup dried fruit, finely chopped Drain pineapple, reserving
  2 to 3 tablespoons
    juice.  Combine pineapple, Yogurt Cheese and reserved juice in a
  food processor or blender and process until well mixed. Stir in dried
  fruit. Cover cheese and          chill. Makes about 2 cups.
  
  1 cup Yogurt Cheese 1/2 cup cooked fish (like salmon) 2-3 sprigs fresh
  dill, chopped OR 1/2 teaspoon dry 1-2 tablespoons grated onion
  Combine all ingredients and mix well. (If you can "afford" the extra
  sodium, this spread is delicious   made   from smoked fish.)
  FROM:HOLD the Fat, Sugar, & Salt by  Goldie Silverman and Jacqueline
  Williams copyright 1984 NOTE: My dad used to talk about making cheese
  this way when he was a young man, he is now 72.  Of course, it wasn't
  made from yogurt, but he used to add chopped
       green onions (or chives?) to the cheese and simply used it as a
  spread.

      Title: BASICS: BAKER'S DOZEN TIPS
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 24 Bars
 
MMMMM-------------------------INFO ONLY------------------------------
 
  Baking is a joy, not a chore, and should never be undertaken if you
  are feeling rushed. Use your imagination and alter the add-ins as you
  see fit.
  
  1. Always read through the entire recipe before starting to Bake.
  
  2. Start with ingredients at room temperature.
  
  3. Always Bake bars, squares and cookies in the centre of the oven on
  the middle rack. If baking more than one pan at a time, place them at
  different angles on different racks to allow maximum circulation of
  heat. Alternate their placement on the racks halfway through the
  baking time.
  
  4. The best pans are aluminum or metal pans that are light in colour.
  Dark pans will cause the base or bar to Bake and brown more quickly.
  
  5. If using glass dishes, reduce oven temperature by 25 degrees and
  slightly decrease the baking time.
  
  6. Use only the size of pan called for. The difference between an
  8-inch square pan and a 9-inch square pan can mean the difference
  between a moist, chewy bar and an under baked, heavy failure.
  
  7. Check baked goods at earliest time indicated. Over baking will dry
  out bars and squares.
  
  8. If making a sticky or fluffy batter or base, wet your hands or
  spatula with water before patting or spreading the batter in the pan.
  
  9. Let most bars cool completely before cutting. There are exceptions,
  however. Bars with a sticky filling need to have a knife run around
  the edge of the pan after being removed from the oven to prevent
  sticking.
  
  10. Score chocolate-topped bars as soon as the topping is applied to
  prevent the chocolate from cracking later.
  
  11. Use metal or plastic dry measures for measuring dry ingredients
  and glass wet measures for measuring liquid ingredients.
  
  12. All-purpose flour does not need to be sifted. However, when a
  recipe calls for cake-and-pastry flour, the flour should be sifted
  and then measured.
  
  13. Store nuts in the freezer to retain their freshness.

 Categories: Pastanoodle
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     20 c  Water
      2 tb Salt

  Tip: Fine strands and small shapes of dried pasta cook in as little
  as 3 minutes.
  
  Tip: If pasta is to be coated with a sauce, do not rinse. The starchy
  coating on pasta aids in holding sauce to the pasta.

      Title: BASIL CHEESE TORTA WITH RED BELL PEPPER STRIP
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian, Herbs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Cream cheese; softened
      4 tb Butter; softened
    3/4 c  Basil pesto
    1/2 lb Provolone, thinly sliced
    1/4 c  Toasted pine nuts
      1    Red bell pepper; roasted,
           -- peeled, seeded, and
           -- cut into 3" x 3/8" strips
      1 sm Jar sun-dried tomatoes
           -- (packed in olive oil)
           Fresh basil for garnish
 
  Mix cream cheese and butter with a fork; add pesto and mix well.
  
  Line a small (3-cup) loaf pan or bowl with plastic wrap, leaving
  several inches of overhang on each side. Make a thin layer of
  provolone slices on the bottom and partially up the sides. Spread 1/3
  of the pesto mixture over the cheese; artistically arrange 2 or 3
  sun-dried tomatoes, 4-6 bell pepper strips, and about 1 tablespoon
  toasted pine nuts over the pesto. Repeat layers until all ingredients
  are used (reserving some of the pine nuts to sprinkle on top),
  pressing down well between layers. Chill overnight or for several
  days. Serve at room temperature on a platter wreathed with fresh
  basil sprigs.  Additional toasted pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes cut
  into flowers, red bell pepper strips, and fresh basil sprigs may be
  used as garnish.
  
  NOTE: Torta may be presented inverted or not.  Keeps several weeks
  refrigerated.  Although best served at room temperature, it slices
  best chilled.  I like to serve it on a platter adorned with grape
  leaves and small clusters of red and white grapes.
  
  VARIATIONS: =========== Use lemon pesto; substitute slivered toasted
  almonds for the pine nuts; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and add 1
  teaspoon lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture.
  
  Use purple pesto; omit the red pepper if desired and increase the
  sun-dried tomatoes.
  
  Use cinnamon basil pesto; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and the red
  peppers if desired, and use pecans instead of pine nuts.

  Make the crust:
  
  Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan. Process flour, salt and
  butter just until combined and crumbly in texture. Add water, 2
  tablespoons at a time. Do not overprocess. Press evenly into pan, up
  1 1/2 inches at the side. Allow to chill while making the filling.
  
  Make the filling:
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Combine CIBO goat cheese, ricotta, butter, eggs (adding one at a time,
  processing well after each addition), flour, salt and pepper. Pour
  filling into shell, bake until puffed and brown for 25-30 minutes.

  from Italian or garlic bread. Or cut with smaller cutter and serve as

      Title: BASQUE SHEEPHERDER BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Yeast, Sheepherder, Linda magee
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -(Makes 1 HUGE loaf)
      2 pk ACTIVE DRY YEAST (2
           -TBS--recipe says)
      4 c  WARM WATER (120- to 130^)
    1/4 c  WARM WATER (105- to 110^)
  1 1/2 tb SALT (I used salt
           -substitute)
    1/2 c  SUGAR
      9    To 11 cups BREAD FLOUR,
           -divided
 
  Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup water (105- to 110^).
  
  To the 4 cups of water (120- to 130^) in a LARGE mixing bowl, add
  salt, sugar, and 4 cups of flour. Add yeast mixture and mix well. Add
  enough flour to make a workable dough. Knead well--takes a loooong
  time and I don't think you can make it using, either a Kitchenaid or
  ABM, you have to do it by hand, give yourself PLENTY of counter
  space. <g> I kneaded the dough for about 15 minutes--took that long
  to get the flour to absorb.
  
  Place dough into a LARGE, greased bowl (I used my large Tupperware
  cake-taker--this is a LOT of dough) and turn to coat top. Cover with
  plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise until double. The
  recipe didn't give a time--mine took about 1 hour, maybe less, I
  nearly forgot about it. <g>
  
  Punch down, knead lightly and form into a round loaf. Place in a 4-1/2
  quart Dutch oven. The recipe says to cover with plastic wrap but I
  knew that if I did that, the loaf might deflate. I lightly sprayed a
  piece of waxed paper with Pam and covered it with that--came off
  nicely without deflating the loaf. Let rise again until double. Mine
  took about 25 minutes and it was trying to climb out of the Dutch
  oven. Preheat the oven to 425^ about 15 minutes before the dough is
  ready.
  
  Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven to 350^ and bake
  for an additional 50-60 minutes. My loaf was getting too brown so I
  covered it with foil when I reduced the oven temperature. I also
  decided to reduce the heat to 325^ and only baked it for about 45
  minutes-- it was done. NOTE: Next time, if there is one, I plan on
  cutting the recipe in half--it's REALLY BIG. I expected it to be BIG,
  but 9-1/2" high and 10" wide? That's how big this loaf is--never seen
  anything like it before. Half the recipe, cooked in the same size
  Dutch oven would make a nice size and shaped loaf. Making the entire
  recipe, it would make a GREAT bowl for any dip and the bread could be
  used for dipping. Oh, have fun trying to find something to store it
  in--I ended up using a medium-size (new) trash can liner and it
  filled it up. It's light and airy inside (like a French bread) and
  the crust nice and chewy--I opted to brush the loaf with water once I
  took it from the oven and it never got really soft--stayed chewy.

  garlic and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the water to a boil and
  turn the heat down. Cover the kettle with a lid and keep the water
  boiling until the tongue is tender to fork. This can take three or
  more hours. When the tongue is tender, run cold water over it and
  skin it. Be sure to trim the membranes under the tongue. Next slice
  the tongue to about 1/4 inch slices. (The tongue can be fixed a day
  or two ahead and then wrapped in saran wrap and refrigerated. Saute
  the garlic, onion and green pepper until golden brown. Add tomato
  sauce, pimento and sugar. Simmer slowly for 15 minutes. Add the
  tongue and continue simmering until the tongue is good and hot. This
  dish is good hot or cold. The sauce can also be used for tripe, pigs
  feet or any left over meat. Walt

      Title: BATTER FRIED SAGE LEAVES (SALBEY ZU BACKEN)
 Categories: German
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  (scant) flour
      3 tb Cold water
      1    Egg, beaten
           A few tablespoons white wine
           -(or hard cider)
      1    Egg white
      1 tb Melted butter that has been
           -allowed to cool
      1 pn Salt
      1 pn (small) sugar
 
  This recipe is taken almost verbatim from a cookbook originally
  published in 1709; the language has been slightly modernized, but
  only 2 ingredients have been added (sugar and salt).
  
  plenty of nice fresh sage leaves oil or shortening for deep frying
  
  Take the flour and mix with the cold water into a thick batter that
  must be smooth.  Then mix in the beaten egg and stir well; pour in a
  little sour wine, yet not too much. Beat the egg white into soft
  peaks and fold into the batter.  Finally, add the butter as well as a
  very little salt and sugar and stir the batter once more. Wash and
  dry off the sage leaves, dredge them in the batter, and fry them on
  both sides in hot lard (see Note) until crispy.
  
  Note:  I [=Horst Scharfenberg] would suggest that you fold in the egg
  white last of all and let the batter sit for about 30 minutes
  beforehand. Also, vegetable oil or shortening is recommended for deep
  frying rather than lard.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

 Categories: Salads, Greek
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12 ea Beets (or more), med. size
           Oil (optional)
           Vinegar (optional) OR
           Skordalia (garlic) Sauce

MMMMM----------------------SKORDALIA SAUCE---------------------------
      1 ea Head of garlic
    3/4 lb Potatoes, boiled, peeled
      2 c  Oil (or more)
    1/3 c  Vinegar
           Almonds
           Walnuts
 
     Select fresh tender beets and cut off the tops and roots. Wash the
  beets, without removing the skins, and boil in a large pot with ample
  water.  Meanwhile, clean the beet greens with the stems; add to the
  pot after the beets have cooked 30 min.  When beets are tender,
  remove and strain the liquid.  Peel the beets and cut them into round
  slices; chop up the greens. Mound greens in center of a platter and
  surround them with the beet slices.  Pour oil and vinegar over all,
  and serve. or serve with Skordalia (garlic) Sauce. Serve hot or cold.
  
     SKORDALIA SAUCE:  Clean garlic and mash it completely (you may use
  food processor).  Mash in potatoes, one by one, until you have a
  thick paste (the more potatoes you use, the more sauce you get--but
  less potent). Alternately add the oil and vinegar, beating
  constantly. If the sauce is too thick for your taste, add a little
  water or fish or chicken stock. NO LUMPS IN THIS SAUCE, P-L-E-A-S-E !!
  
     NOTE:  Many people like to add almonds or walnuts to skordalia.
  These are mashed to a pulp and added to the paste before the
  potatoes, oil, and vinegar.

 Categories: Desserts, Dairy
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Envelope unflavored gelatin
      2 tb Cold water
      2    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ds Salt
      1 c  Milk
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Heavy cream, or 2 cups
           -whipped topping
 
  Sprinkle gelatin on cold water. Beat egg yolks, sugar & salt in the
  top of a double boiler. Beat until light. Add milk. Cook over boiling
  water, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick & smooth. Add
  softened gelatin, dissolve. Add vanilla. Cool until thick, stirring
  often. Whip cream until it is very thick, but not stiff, fold into
  the cooled gelatin mixture. Pour into a 6-cup mold rinsed in cold
  water, chill until set. Unmold, serve with chocolate sauce. Makes 6
  servings.
  
  My Notes: I added an extra egg yolk, & about half a pint of red
  raspberries to the milk mixture to make sure it would thicken. I
  didn't have heavy cream, so I used a cup of lite sour cream.
