      Title: CHICKEN A LA KIN HWA
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
  2 1/2 lb Young chicken
    1/2 lb Cooked ham
      4 c  Green cabbage or broccoli
    1/2 tb Salt
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Monosodium glutamate
      1 tb Cornstarch (corn flour)
      1 ts Sesame seed oil
 
  This colorful dish is also very simple to make. Kin Hwa refers to the
  delicious ham from Jinhua. Chicken, a la Kin Hwa, is traditionally
  served with the head as a center piece.
  
  Clean the chicken, plunge it into a pot of boiling water, immediately
  turn off the heat and put on a tight lid. Leave the chicken in the
  hot water for an hour, then take it out and leave it to cool.
  
  Carefully remove the meat from the bone but keep the skin on; cut the
  chicken into 24 pieces. Cut the ham into 24 thin slices.
  
  Arrange the chicken and ham slices in alternating overlapping layers
  on a plate, and steam for 10 minutes. Meanwhile parboil the greens in
  chicken stock until soft, then arrange them around the chicken and
  ham.
  
  In a little saucepan, warm about half a cup of chicken stock with
  salt, sugar, monosodium glutamate and cornstarch (corn flour); stir
  to make it smooth; add sesame seed oil and pour it over the chicken
  and ham. Serve either as a starter for a banquet or as a main course
  for an informal meal.

 Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
     20 oz Frozen green peas
      2 tb Instant minced onion
      1 c  Green peppers -- chopped
  1 1/3 c  Boiling water
      2 qt Chicken broth
  1 2/3 c  Unsifted flour
      1 qt Milk
  2 1/2 lb Cooked chicken -- diced
           (about 8 cups)
     16 oz Canned mushrooms pieces --
           Drained (3 cups)
    1/4 c  Pimientos -- chopped
      3 tb Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
      2 ts Poultry seasoning
 
  Line four 8x8-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap. Allow
  enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six servings
  or one-fourth of the recipe. Baking pans are not needed for food to
  be served without freezing.
  
  Add peas, onion, and green pepper to boiling water. Cover. Cook
  slowly for 5 minutes. Drain; save cooking liquid. Combine vegetable
  cooking liquid with broth. Heat to boiling.
  
  Mix flour with milk.  Stir slowly into broth mixture. Cook until
  thickened, stirring constantly. Stir in chicken, vegetables, mushroom
  pieces, pimientos, and seasonings.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Heat to serving temperature. Serve over
  cooked rice or hot biscuits.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Pour one-fourth of the mixture into one of the prepared
  baking pans.  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
  wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
  together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
  food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
  tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
  food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
  immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
  freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Heat 1 1/2 hours or until
  bubbly at edges. Stir occasionally during heating. After heating,
  stir gently until sauce is smooth.  Serve over cooked rice or hot
  biscuits.

      Title: CHICKEN A LA POITEVINE
 Categories: Chicken, Casseroles, French
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Roasting chicken
      2 tb Butter
      1 tb Oil
    1/4 pt Brandy
      1    Garlic head
           Salt & pepper
 
  Joint the chicken into the usual 7 pieces (or buy 2-3 lbs chicken
  portions). Separate the head of garlic into cloves and peel them.
  Don't be put off by the quantity of garlic, it doesn't taint the
  breath at all. Above all, don't reduce the proportion.
  
  In a large casserole, heat the oil with the butter until the froth
  subsides **BEWARE** Don't let the butter burn. A few pieces at a
  time, fry the carefully dried chicken joints on both sides, turning
  once only. You don't want to cook them, just brown them lightly.
  
  As soon as they are all cooked, pour off the excess fat, trying to
  keep any crusty bits in the pan. (I put a knife blade on the edge
  just to let through the fat.) Return the browned chicken to the hot
  casserole, and still over moderate heat, pour over half the brandy,
  which you have warmed gently in a ladle. Set light to it, shaking
  until the flames subside. **WATCH OUT FOR YOUR HAIR**
  
  Reduce heat, pour over the brandy, add the whole garlic cloves, season
  generously with freshly ground pepper. Cook 20-40 mins depending on
  how well cooked you like your chicken done, or until tender. For
  modern broilers, 20 minutes is long enough for them to be tender. For
  older free-range chicken, 40 minutes may not be long enough! You will
  have a few tablespoonsful of sauce. Correct seasoning and serve very
  hot. The garlic cloves will be deliciously edible.

  "While Schwartz describes the name for this Israeli dish as slightly
  pretentious, he notes that it won a cooking competition and found its
  way onto the menus of five star hotels. He recommends serving it over
  a bed or bulgur pilaf."
  
  In large glass bow, combine chicken parts, orange juice, wine, zest,
  salt, paprika and pepper. Let marinate in fridge for 2 hours. Lift
  chicken out of marinade; pat dry and reserve chicken & marinate
  separately. In deep heavy skillet or shallow pan large enough to hold
  chicken in one layer; heat oil over medium-high heat. Brown chicken
  on all sides; transfer to plate. In the same pan, cook onion over low
  heat until it starts to change colour. Pour in marinade and simmer
  gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Return chicken to pan
  and simmer, partially covered, basting the chicken with pan juices
  and turning the pieces over very low heat for about 35 minutes; or
  until chicken juices run clear when flesh is pierced with a sharp
  knife. Transfer chicken to warm serving platter and keep warm. Skim
  off excess fat. Add olives to pan and boil rapidly over high heat
  until glossy and starting to thicken. Pour over chicken and sprinkle
  with meat. SERVES: 4-6

 Categories: Mexican, Seafood, Poultry, Sauces
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lg Poblano peppers
    1/4 c  Onion, chopped
    1/2 lb Medium shrimp, lightly
           Cooked, peeled, and chopped
    1/4 c  Cilantro, chopped
    1/4 lb Monterey jack cheese,
           Shredded
      2    8 ozs chicken breasts,
           Halved, deboned, and
           Pounded flat
      2 ts White pepper
           Salt, to taste
     12    6-in long strings
           Oil, for frying

MMMMM--------------------CREAMY SHRIMP SAUCE-------------------------
      3    Shallots, diced
      1 c  White wine
    1/2 c  Fish stock or chicken broth
      1 lb Small shrimp
      2 c  Whipping cream
    3/4 lb Butter
 
  ROAST PEPPERS:  Place poblano peppers under the broiler and char on
  all sides. Put in plastic bag and freeze 10 minutes. Remove from
  freezer, rub off peel, then slit to remove seeds under running water.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  In a medium saute pan, saute onion,
  shrimp, and cilantro until the shrimp are almost cooked, about 5
  minutes. Place in mixture in a bowl, add the cheese and set aside.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE:  Lay the four prepared chicken breasts flat, skin-side
  down. Season with salt and white pepper. Layer each breast with one
  pepper and 2 to 3 tablespoons shrimp/cheese mixture over pepper. Roll
  each breast tightly to form a cylinder. Tie each cylinder in 3
  places, both ends and in the middle.
  
  In a skillet, heat about 1/4-inch of oil.  Lightly brown chicken
  breasts, one at a time, on all sides. Remove from heat, transfer to a
  oven-proof dish and bake for 10 minutes until golden brown.
  
  Remove from oven.  Cut strings and slice chicken into 1-inch roulades
  (rounds).  Drizzle a few tablespoons of Creamy Shrimp Sauce onto a
  plate and arrange the roulades on top of the sauce. Serve warm. Makes
  4 servings.
  
  TO MAKE CREAMY SHRIMP SAUCE:  In a saucepan over medium-high heat,
  combine shallots and wine.  Cook until reduced by three-fourths. Add
  stock/broth and shrimp and cook until reduced by half. Add the cream
  and reduce again by half. Whisk in the butter by tablespoons. Cook
  until butter melts and sauce is well-blended. Remove from heat.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Oil, olive
      2 lg Onions, diced
      2 md Pepper, bell, diced
    1/2 c  Parsley, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Onion, green, diced
      1 ts Mint, dried, crushed
      1 tb Garlic, minced
      1 c  Wine, white, dry
      2 c  Stock, chicken
      2 lb Tomatoes, fresh, chopped
           -- (@ 4 cups)
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Sauce, cayenne,
           -- Louisianna Hot Sauce
      1    Chicken, fryer, cooked,
           -- deboned
           Rice, cooked
 
       Cook the chicken by boiling it in water and vegetables as you
  would to make a good chicken stock. When the chicken is cooked,
  remove the chicken from the broth, cool, and debone. Set aside the
  warm pieces of chicken for later in the recipe.
  
       Strain the chicken stock and reserve.
  
       In a large pot or Dutch oven, put the olive oil in over moderate
  heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pot. Add the onions, pepper,
  parsley and saute for a minute with stirring.
  
       Add diced green onion and saute for another minute.
  
       Add mint, garlic, and white wine (the wine tends to take the
  bitterness out of onions, garlic, and other ingredients and takes the
  place of sugar for making these ingredients milder) and continue to
  simmer for two minutes.
  
       Add the chicken stock, tomatoes and soy sauce and simmer for
  another 2 minutes.
  
       Add a teaspoon of salt, and the Louisianna Hot Sauce (made from
  cayenne pepper) to taste and stir. Obviously Justin Wilson LOVES hot
  sauce ...  and you may not. Use it as sparingly or as generously as
  you like.
  
       To the hot simmering mixture, add the cooked chicken to the pot
  and stir occasionally while simmering ten to fifteen minutes over low
  heat. The chicken is already cooked, the simmering is to let the
  flavors merge and meld together before serving.
  
       Serve the Chicken ala Creole over cooked rice with a glass of
  red wine and pieces of Burgundy Bread ** on the side.

    1/4 c  Chicken broth
 
  POUND THE CHICKEN BREASTS as you would for scaloppine, then slice them
  crosswise at 1/2-inch intervals. Marinate chicken for 30 minutes at
  room temperature in a mixture of the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, port
  and 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil. Trim the coarse stem ends from
  the asparagus. Peel the asparagus and slice them crosswise, slightly
  on the diagonal, into 1-inch lengths. Peel and halve the onion, then
  cut each half into thin slices. Core, seed and slice the red bell
  pepper lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips. Set a wok or large skillet
  over high heat. Add the chili oil and 1 tablespoon of the remaining
  sesame oil and heat the oil for about 1 minute, until ripples appear
  on the wok bottom. Add the onion and red pepper and stir-fry the
  mixture for 1 minute. Cover the wok and allow the mixture to steam
  for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables from the
  wok to a heatproof plate. Add the remaining sesame oil to the wok,
  pour in the chicken and marinade, and stir-fry over high heat for 2
  minutes. Blend in the cornstarch mixture, stirring it for about 1
  minute, until the sauce has thickened and becomes clear. Return the
  vegetables to the wok, toss the mixture lightly for about 30 seconds,
  and serve. Accompany the chicken with fluffy boiled rice.

      Title: CHICKEN BAKED IN MILK (POLLO AL LATTE)
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ea Chicken, 2 1/2 lb
      1 qt Milk
      2 oz Butter
      2 oz Ham or bacon
      1 ea Onion
      1 ea Clove garlic
      6 ea Coriander seeds
      1 x  A little basil or marjoram
      1 x  Salt and pepper
 
  Ask the butcher to split the chicken into two halves. Or just joint
  the chicken as usual. . Rub the chicken with salt and pepper, and a
  cut clove of garlic.  Melt the butter in a frying pan and brown the
  chicken in it, together with the chopped onion, ham or bacon, and
  finely chopped garlic. Lay the chicken pieces and the other
  ingredients, including all the hot butter, in a casserole or other
  fireproof dish. In a separate pan, heat the milk to boiling point,
  with the coriander seeds and a pinch of basil or marjoram. Now pour
  it, with the seeds and herbs, over the chicken. Add a pinch of salt
  and black pepper. Bring the milk to simmering point again and keep
  simmering, uncovered, at a moderate pace -- the milk should bubble
  visibly but not fiercely -- for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Don't touch it
  during this period, and you should see a golden skin forming over the
  contents of the pot while the milk bubbles away underneath. At the
  end of this time, stir the skin into the milk, together with any
  crusty bits sticking to the sides of the pan.  The milk will have
  reduced quite a bit now, and will be getting thick.  Continue
  simmering for another 1/2 hour, till the sauce has reduced to a
  cupful or so, watching carefully to see that it does not "catch" and
  burn. . This dish can be eaten either hot or cold. If hot, serve the
  chicken from the pan, as it is, with some of the thick sauce. Nice
  with noodles and peas. If it is to be eaten cold, lay the chicken
  pieces out flat on a plate amd coat them carefully with the remaining
  sauce, before leaving them to cool.

      2    Bay leaves
      1    Fresh thyme sprig
 
  Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Grill or
  broil, skin side toward the flame (or heating element), until the
  skin is bubbly (about 15 minutes in an electric oven).
  
  While the peppers are broiling, prepare the onion and garlic. Place
  1/3 of the fat in a large frying pan and melt it over medium heat.
  Add the pork belly and cook for a few minutes to release some of the
  fat. Add the onion and 3 cloves of the garlic. Cook, stirring
  occasionally, until translucent, about 10 minu.
  
  Remove the peppers from the oven or grill and place in a paper bag
  for a few minutes. When the peppers have cooled slightly, remove the
  skin. Coarsely chop the peppers (to make 2.5 c)
  
  Add the bell peppers and the hot peppers to the onions and garlic.
  Increase the heat and allow the mixture to color slightly. Add the
  tomatoes. Continue cooking over high heat for about 5 min, or until
  the tomatoes have collapsed. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook,
  partially covered and stirring occasionally, for 40 min.
  
  Twenty minutes before the vegetables are done, season the chicken
  with salt and pepper. Place the remaining fat in a large,
  straight-sided frying pan, a wide-mouthed stock pot or braiser. Melt
  the fat over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces, two garlic,
  bay leaves and thyme. Brown the chicken on all sides, working in two
  batches if necessary, so there is no trace of red.
  
  Return all of the chicken to the pot and add the vegetable mixture.
  Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and cook at a low simmer for 30 min.

 Categories: Cajun, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTA--------------------------------
      6 qt Hot water
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      3 tb Salt
  1 1/2 lb Fresh spaghetti (1 lb dry)

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      2 ts Dried thyme leaves
  1 1/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper
      1 ts White pepper
    3/4 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Dried sweet basil leaves

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 lb Unsalted butter plus
      4 tb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Onions, chopped very fine
      4 ea Med. garlic cloves, peeled
      2 ts Minced garlic
  3 1/4 c  RICH chicken stock (see note
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 tb Tabasco sauce + 1 teaspoon
      2 cn Tomato sauce (16 oz)
      2 tb Sugar
      2 c  Green onions,chopped vy fine

MMMMM-------------------CHICKEN SEASONING MIX------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Salt
  1 1/2 ts White pepper
  1 1/2 ts Garlic powder
  1 1/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Cumin (optional)
    1/2 ts Dried sweet basil leaves
      2 lb Boneless chicken (see notes)
 
  NOTE:  To make a Rich Chicken Stock strain the basic stock, then
  continue simmering it until evaporation reduces the liquid by half.
  For example, if the recipe calls for 1 cup Rich Stock, start it with
  at least 2 cups of strained basic stock. dark meat, cut into 1/2-inch
  cubes. Directions: Place in the hot water, oil and salt in a large
  pot over high heat; and cover and bring to a boil.  When water
  reaches a rolling boil, add small amounts of spaghetti at a time to
  the pot, breaking up oil patches as you drop the spaghetti in.
  Return to boiling and cook to al dente stage, do not over cook.(To
  test doneness of spaghetti, cut a strand in half near the end of
  cooking time.  When done, there should be only a speck of white in
  the center, less than one-fourth the diameter of the strand.) Do not
  overcook. During this cooking time, use a wooden or spaghetti spoon
  to lift spaghetti out of the water by spoonfuls and shake strands
  back into the boiling water.  (It may be an old wives' tale, but this
  procedure seems to enhance the spaghetti's texture.) Then immediately
  drain spaghetti into a collander; stop cooking process by running
  cold water over strands. (If you used dry spaghetti, first rinse with
  hot water to wash off starch.) After the pasta has cooled thoroughly,
  about 2 to 3 minutes, pour a liberal amount of vegetable oil in your
  hands and toss spaghetti. Set aside still in the colander.
      Meanwhile, thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a
  small bowl and set aside.
      In a 4-quart saucepan, combine 1-1/2 sticks of the butter, the
  onions and garlic cloves; saute over medium heat 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Add the minced garlic and seasoning mix; continue
  cooking over medium heat until onions are dark brown, but not burned,
  about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add 2-1/2 cups of the stock,
  the Worcestershire and Tabasco; bring to a fast simmer and cook about
  8 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the tomato sauce and bring mixture
  to a boil. Then stir in the sugar and 1 cup of the green onions;
  gently simmer uncovered about 40 nminutes, stirring occasionally.
      Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.
      Combine the ingredients of the chicken seasoning mix in a small
  bowl; mix well.  Sprinkle over the chicken, rubbing it in with your
  hands. In a large skillet melt 1-1/2 sticks of the butter over medium
  heat. Add the remaining 1 cup green onions and saute over high heat
  about 3 minutes. Add the chicken and continue cooking 10 minutes,
  stirring frequently. When the tomato sauce has simmered about 40
  minutes, stir in the chicken mixture and heat through.
      To finish the dish, for each serving melt 2 tablespoons butter in
  a large skillet over medium heat. Add one-sixth of the cooked
  spaghetti (a bit less than a 2 cup measure); heat spaghetti 1 minute,
  stirring constantly.  Add 1-1/4 cups chicken and sauce and 2
  tablespoons of remaining stock; heat throughly, stirring frequently.
  Remove from heat. Roll spaghetti on a large fork and lift onto a
  heated serving plate. Repeat process for remaining servings. From

           -If basmati is not available

      2 c  Ordinary brown rice;
  3 1/4 c  Water
           Lemon Wedges; to serve
           Fresh coriander; to serve
 
  Thinly slice 1 onion and set it aside.  Cut the other onion into
  chunks, then puree it to a paste with the garlic, gingerroot, curry
  powder, turmeric and yogurt. If you do not have a blender or food
  processor, then grate the onion and gingerroot and mix with the other
  ingrededients. Add plenty of seasoning, then spoon this mixture over
  the chicken thighs, spreading it evenly over them and turning to coat
  all sides. Cover and chill for 1-24 hours, the longer the better.
  Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or flameproof
  casserole. Add the sliced onion, bay leaves and cardamoms, then cook,
  stirring often, until browned-about 20 minutes.  Use a slotted spoon
  to remove half the onion from the pan and reserve for garnih. Push
  the rest of the onion to one side. Add chicken portions, reserving
  the juices from marinating and brown them all over. Add the rice to
  the pan, sprinkling it down between the chicken. Tuck the cinnamon
  stick in between the chicken, then scrape all the marinating juice
  into the pan.  Pour in 3 3/4 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then
  reduce the heat and cover pan tightly. Leave to gently for 30-35
  minutes, until the rice has absorbed the water and the chicken is
  tender. The biriani should be moist. Transfer the birmani to a
  serving dish, or serve it from the cooking pan, sprinkling the
  reserved onion over and addin flavor. Add lemon wedges for
  garnish-their juice should be squeezed over before the birani is
  eaten.

      1    Garlic clove; minced *see no
      1 tb Tomato paste

           Freshly ground pepper; to ta
      2    Whole chicken breasts, split
      1 lb Pressed tofu; ** see note
 
  Recipe by: Larissa Vigue <VIGUE@INET.CHAMPLAIN.EDU> * use more, use
  more!! ~ strictly my opinion. ** method for pressing follows
  
  Heat the broiler, or light your grill so you'll be able to cook over
  very hot coals.
  
  In a small saucepan bring the broth to a gentle simmer over medium
  heat. Add the shallot and garlic, turn down the heat to medium-low,
  and simmer, uncovered, stirring often, until the vegetables soften,
  about 7 minutes.
  
  Add the tomato paste, honey, mustard, tarragon or thyme, orange juice,
  vinegar, and pepper, stirring until the mixture thickens into a dense
  paste, about 4 minutes.
  
  Remove the glaze from the heat and let it cool slightly, about 5
  minutes.
  
  Using a pastry brush, slather the glaze on the chicken breasts, if
  using, lifting the skin to brush it underneath rather than on top.
  Place the chicken under the broiler skin side up or on the grill skin
  side down. If grilling, cover it with the grill lid or foil. Turn the
  breasts over after 4 to 6 minutes if broiling, and 8 minutes if
  grilling, and cook until clear juice runs from the breast when you
  pierce it with a knife, about 4 to 8 minutes more.
  
  If using tofu, coat well with glaze and grill or broil until heated
  through about 4 to 6 minutes on each side.
  
  How to Press Tofu (from p. 145)
  
  If you can't find pressed tofu, it's easy to make your own.
  
  1)  Put several layers of absorbent paper towel inside a baking pan
  or wide bowl.
  
  2)  Put a 1 pound block of firm or extra-firm tofu on top and put
  another few layers of paper towel over it.
  
  3)  Weigh it down with something very heavy, such as a cast-iron pot
  or a pile of ceramic plates. Refrigerate overnight.
  
  Per serving with chicken breasts: calories-187.7grams; fat-3.4grams;
  protein-28.8grams; carbohydrates-9.4grams; cholesterol-73milligrams;

 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 tb Sweet butter
      2 tb Chopped scallions
    1/2 lb Button mushrooms, whole
           -or quartered large ones
           -wiped, stems removed
           Salt
           Freshly ground white
           -pepper
      6    Prepared chicken breasts
           -with skin removed,
           -slightly flattened
    1/2 c  Concentrated chicken
           -stock*
      1 ds Lemon juice
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1    Beurre Manie*
      2 tb Finely chopped chives
 
  * Beurre Manie is used to thicken sauces.  These butter-flour balls
  can be made ahead in advance and stored in a sealed jar in the
  refrigerator for 1 or 2 weeks. Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter
  on a small flat plate and blend the mixture with a fork into a very
  smooth paste. Roll the paste into a ball. In a small skillet, heat 2
  T of butter. Add the scallions and cook for 2 or 3 minutes without
  browning. Add the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and cook the
  mixture over high heat for 2 or 3 more minutes to brown the mushrooms
  lightly. Reserve. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and
  sprinkle them with lemon juice. In a large chicken fryer, melt the
  remaining butter. When it is quite hot, add the chicken breasts and
  cook them for 1 minute on each side. Cover the pan with buttered wax
  paper and then the pan lid. Lower the heat and simmer the chicken
  breasts for another 8 to 10 minutes or until the juices run out pale
  yellow when pierced with a fork. Do not overcook or pierce every
  piece. Immediately remove the chicken breasts to a serving platter.
  Pour the chicken stock into the fryer, raise the heat and reduce the
  stock until it is almost a glaze. Add the heavy cream and continue
  cooking over high heat.  Add the Beurre Manie and cook until the
  sauce heavily coats a spoon. Add the chives and correct the
  seasoning. Add the mushroom & scallion mixture.  Add the chives and
  correct the seasoning. Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts and
  serve at once. From "Season Kitchen" by Perla Meyers. * DeLuxe2 1.25

  should be a light, golden color. Cook breast halves in batches,
  salting and peppering each breast after it is turned. Remove breast
  halves to a platter and keep warm. 2) If more than about 2
  tablespoons of fat remains, tilt the skillet and remove the excess.

  To prepare chicken breasts, place between sheets of waxed paper.
  Gently pound with a mallet until flat and tender. Sprinkle each with
  salt, pepper and lemon juice. Keep covered in refrigerator.
  
  To make stuffing, combine ham, garlic, ginger, half the tarragon and
  about 2/3 of the lemon zest in a bowl, blending well. Add a dash of
  lemon juice or wine to moisten.
  
  To stuff breasts, place equal amounts of filling on center of each.
  Bring sides up to encase filling, shaping with your hands into a
  round package and tucking in ends to seal. Greasy the shiny side of
  six, foot-long strips of foil, about 2 inches wide. Encircle each
  breast with foil, greased side in, pulling tightly so that foil wraps
  around breast. (This retains shape during baking.)  Fold over edge on
  top to secure foil. Brush tops of chicken with butter. Sprinkle with
  salt, pepper and a little tarragon. Can be refrigerated, covered at
  this point, if baking is to be done several hours later.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 F.  Place the vegetable mirepoix in bottom of a
  large baking dish.  Place chicken breasts on top of vegetables. Pour
  enough wine around bottom of pan just to cover mirepoix. Bake 10 to
  12 minutes, then turn heat down to 350 degrees. Baste chicken. Cover
  pan loosely with foil and bake another 15 minutes or until chicken
  breasts are done but still moist inside. Remove foil covering from
  pan; turn broiler on to brown chicken tops, about 2 minutes.
  
  Remove pan from oven.  Place chicken on heated platter and keep warm;
  carefully remove foil strips. Meanwhile, remove and discard mirepoix
  vegetables from roasting pan. Place pan on top of stove. Remove any
  surface fat and bring to a boil.  Add chicken stock and cream and
  reduce over high heat, stirring until of desired consistency. Taste
  and adjust seasonings.
  
  To serve, garnish chicken breasts with remaining lemon zest and
  tarragon. Place a little sauce on a heated plate, then place chicken
  breast on top.
  
  Good served with rice-stuffed tomatoes.
  
  Serves 4 to 6, depending upon size of chicken breasts.
  
  Note:  Mirepoix means aromatic vegetables (carrot, celery and onion)
  chopped and placed in the bottom of a roasting pan).
  
  Most of this dish can be prepared in advance.

      4    Romaine lettuce leaves

  Contributed to the echo by: Sandy Colby Originally from: The Daily
  Tribune, "Micro Magic" column, written by Norma Schomwetter This was
  in Today's local paper, "The Daily Tribune", in a weekly column
  called _Micro Magic_, written by Norma Schomwetter. The recipe was
  taken from a book titled _Microwave Entertaining_ by Marcia Cone and
  Thelma Snyder. It sounded so good, I thought I'd pass it along.
  Chicken breasts, Zucchini in Romaine Leaves dash cayenne pepper
  
  Place chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; flatten to about
  1/4"; set aside. Place romaine leaves on a 10" round micro proof
  platter. Cover tightly with vented plastic wrap. Microwave on HIGH
  35-50 seconds or until pliable. Place a chicken breast half on each
  leaf, sprinkle with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Divide zucchini strips
  into 4 bunches and place at the top of each chicken breast. Starting
  at the end with the zucchini, roll the lettuce and chicken toward the
  stem of the lettuce. Place rolls seam side down in a circle on the
  10" platter. Cover tightly again, and microwave on HIGH 8-10 minutes,
  or until chicken is cooked through. Drain juices. Save in a 2 C
  measure. Let chicken stand, covered. To the 2 C measure, add the
  remaining ingredients and microwave on HIGH 3-5 minutes. To serve,
  spoon 2 Tbsp of sauce onto each plate.
  
  (sjc: the ingredients don't call for any pepper except that of the
  cayenne at the end of the ingredients list. I assume the cayenne goes
  into the sauce, and the pepper called for earlier would be black
  pepper, even though it's not mentioned. Any comments?)

      Title: CHICKEN BREASTS WITH GREEN CORIANDER (CILANTR
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Boneless chicken breasts
      1 bn Baby carrots
      1 bn Coriander (cilantro)
      2 tb Best quality olive oil
      1 ts Lemon juice
 
  Skin the chicken breasts and dust them with a little salt and pepper.
  Lay each one on a square of baking parchment, flatten it lightly with
  the palm of your hand and lay a sprig of coriander on top. Fold the
  sides of the paper over the meat, excluding as much air as possible,
  and roll up to make a neat flat parcel. Then overwrap carefully with
  foil to make a waterproof package.  Trim and scrub the carrots.
  Measure the olive oil into a small saucepan and add a seasoning of
  salt and pepper. Coarsely chop a tablespoon or two of coriander
  leaves (a little less for beginners, a little more for addicts) and
  reserve separately. All these preparations can be done well ahead.
      About 20 minutes before you plan to serve the dish, start cooking.
  Steam the baby carrots.  Drop the chicken parcels, seam side up, into
  a large pan of boiling water and cook for 13 to 18 minutes depending
  on the size of the breasts.  Barely a bubble should disturb the
  surface of the liquid while the chicken cooks. Transfer the parcels,
  still wrapped up, to a low oven for 5 minutes to let the meat set.
      Blot the carrots dry and arrange them on a warmed serving dish.
  Warm the olive oil.  Unwrap the chicken and add just 1 to 2
  tablespoons of the juices to the pan of warming olive oil. Quickly
  carve the breasts into thin slices and arrange the meat beside the
  carrots. Add the lemon juice to the hot olive oil and immediately
  pour the sizzling mixture over the chicken and carrots.  Scatter with
  chopped coriander and serve straightway with hot crusty bread to mop
  up the juices.

        ds Salt & pepper
      4 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
           Chopped fresh dill
           Kalamata olives
 
  In a medium bowl, mix together the yoghurt, garlic, oregano, salt, &
  pepper. Reserve a small amount (~1/4 C.) to serve with the chicken.
  Add the chicken breasts to the bowl with the yoghurt mixture, turning
  to coat, and allow to marinate for 20-30 minutes. Grill or broil the
  chicken breasts for a few minutes on each side, sprinkling them with
  the crumbled feta after turning them the first time. Garnish with
  chopped dill and olives and serve with the reserved sauce.
  
  I always double the recipe - the chicken is great cold or in a
  sandwich.
  
  Enjoy, Melissa

      Title: CHICKEN BROTH
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 16 Cups
 
      1    Stewing chicken
           -(or 2 broilers
           -and a stick of butter)
     16 c  Water
      1 lg Yellow onion
      1    Bay leaf
      1    Parsley bunch
      1    Thyme bunch, fresh
           -(or a teaball with
           -about 1/2 t dried
           -thyme inside)
 
  Take one large, heavy, lidded pan; mine is a six-quart enamelled
  cast-iron Copco pan with 20 years' good cooking already logged, and I
  live in terror that yuppie burglars will break into my house some
  night and steal it. Put into it one fat old chicken.  If you live in
  a part of the world where there are no fat old chickens for sale, put
  in two scrawny young chickens and a stick of butter.
  
  Put the pan in a cold oven, turn the temperature to 325 degrees F.
  and wait patiently, doing nothing whatsoever to the chicken, for
  about four hours, till it's dark golden.
  
  Take the pot out of the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
  Strip the meat off the bones. Cover everything, meat and bones, with
  about a gallon of water at room temperature. Add a raw onion, peeled
  and quartered, a bay leaf, a bunch of parsley tied together with
  string, and a small bunch of thyme similarly tied or a teaball with
  dried thyme leaves in it. Bring the water up to a simmer and let it
  just simmer (make a mirror, as the French say) for ten minutes. Turn
  it off and return it to room temperature again.
  
  Take the meat out.  It is not as good as it was before the wee
  simmer, but perfectly satisfactory for chicken salad or on waffles
  with creamed chicken or whatever. Waste not want not.
  
  Add another quart of water, bring the broth back up to a simmer and
  simmer it for twenty minutes. Strain out the bones and vegetables.
  You should have about four quarts.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich homemade chicken broth -- Surely people who make use of
  bouillon cubes have no idea how easy home-made broth can be. This is
  not a traditional method, but it produces good results.
  
  *  I've never had good luck freezing broth (it starts to taste
  thinnish), so this is as much as I ever make at once. I keep it in
  the refrigerator in quart Mason canning jars. I've read that you
  should simmer saved broth for twenty minutes every four or five days,
  but it never lasts that long in my house, so I can't comment.
  
  *  I use a cup wherever a recipe calls for a cup of chicken broth. And
  then, after it's been around for a day or two, somebody suggests we
  really haven't had chicken soup with rice for a long, long time... or
  matzoh dumplings... or tortellini in brodo... and then it's all gone.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  about 6 hours, most of it waiting.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  Calories     per serving: 337 Fat grams per serving: 24. Approx. Cook
  Time: 45 1. Both dressing and salad can be prepared a day before
  serving, if you wish. Prepare dressing by combining all dressing
  ingredients, including Parmesan in a bowl.  Whisk until well blended.
  For best flavor, prepare dressing at least several hours before
  using. Refrigerate if making a day ahead. 2.  Roast Chicken Breasts,
  uncovered in a preheated 375F oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until
  chicken feels springy. Alternately, place chicken breasts, thin ends
  toward centre, in a microwave-safe pie plate. Cover with clear wrap
  and microwave on high for 10 to 15 minutes. Rearrange and turn
  halfway through cooking.  Let stand covered, for 3 minutes. 3. Cut
  cooked chickien into 1/2 inch pieces. Pieces should measure about 2
  1/2 cups. Set aside.  Thinly slice mushrooms. Seed red pepper and cut
  into thin julienne strips about  1 1/2 inches long. Seed hot pepper
  if using and finely chop. If making salad ahead, combine chicken,
  mushrooms and peppers in a large bowl.  Cover and refrigerate until
  ready to use. 4. When ready to serve, tear lettuce into bite-size
  pieces. Place in a large sald bowl. Add chicken and vegetables. Whisk
  dressing. Drizzle 1/2 cup dressing over top and toss until evenly
  coated. Then add remaining dressing, if necessary. Toss until evenly
  coated. Source: Gail

    1/4 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 bn Spinach, cooked until

MMMMM------------------------CHEESE SAUCE-----------------------------
      3 tb Butter or Margarine
      4 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Chicken Broth
      3 c  Half-and-Half
           Salt and Pepper to taste
      1 c  Parmesan Cheese
    1/2 c  (to 1 cup) Mozzarella
           -Cheese, grated (opt)
           Spaghetti Sauce (homemade
           -or store bought) (opt)
 
  THE NIGHT BEFORE (or early in the day): Cook lasagna noodles in 6 qts.
  boiling water for 5-7 minutes or until tender; drain, wipe noodles
  dry with a clean/dry cloth, lay flat on waxed paper.
  
  While noodles are cooking, melt butter and olive oil in a large
  skillet. Saute onion, garlic and mushrooms until they're tender; add
  remove from heat; set aside.
  
  Place cooked chicken in food processor and pulse until chicken
  resembles a tuna salad mixture. Combine chicken with the onions,
  garlic, mushrooms and the fat in which they were sauteed; add egg,
  cream and seasonings. Add spinach (cooked) and mix well.
  
  Cut each lasagna noodle into 2 or 3 pieces--each piece should be 3 to
  4 inches long; place a tablespoonful of the chicken filling on each
  piece and roll into a tubular shape. If you don't want to make
  canneloni, just layer the ingredients like you would for lasagna.
  
  Arrange rolls next to each other, one layer deep, in a buttered baking
  dish; set aside while you prepare the cheese sauce.
  
  CHEESE SAUCE: Melt butter then add the flour and cook for a few
  minutes to get rid of the floury taste. Gradually add the chicken
  broth, whisking constantly to prevent lumps; add cream, salt and
  pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth; remove
  from heat. Stir in 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese and mix well.
  
  I like to use, both, red and white sauce on this one. I spoon over a
  strip of the white sauce, next to it I spoon on some red; keep doing
  that across the dish until the sauce covers the noodles. The
  red/white pattern makes it look pretty and gives the dish a little
  more flavor. It also cuts back on some of the fat.
  
  Spoon sauce over cannelloni in baking dish; sprinkle with remaining
  Parmesan cheese and Mozzarella cheese, if used; refrigerate until
  you're ready to bake it.
  
  BEFORE SERVING: Preheat broiler; place cannelloni 4-5 inches from
  heat and broil for 10 minutes or until sauce bubbles and top browns.
  If you'll be making lasagna, bake in a 350-degree oven for 25-30
  minutes, or until it's bubbly and the top is browned a bit.

      Title: CHICKEN CHUNKS WITH PEANUTS IN SPICY SAUCE
 Categories: Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Peanuts; raw
      3 c  Peanut oil
      2 ea Whole chicken breasts at roo
      1 ea Large egg white
  1 1/2 tb Water chestnut flour
      1 x  -----------sauce------------
      4 ea Green onions
      2 ea Large cloves garlic
      1 tb Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 tb Sesame oil
    1/2 tb Chinese red vingear
    1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 ts Chili paste with garlic
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 ea Pinch sugar
      1 ea Cornstarch paste
 
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++
  +++++ Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and
  white part into 1" sections. Mix all other sauce ingredients in
  2-quart saucepan. Reserve. Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken
  meat from bones.  Slice meat into 1" strips, then crosswise to make
  1" chunks. In bowl large enough to hold chicken, add egg white to
  water chestnut flour. Beat mixture with a single chopstick (not an
  egg beater or whisk). Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat
  thoroughly. Marinate 5 minutes. Note: water chestnut flour gives a
  lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted.
  Deep-frying: Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat
  (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer). Fry peanuts until they are a
  light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.
  Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel
  or paper bag. Reserve. Turn up heat slightly for chicken. Test a
  chunk first: chicken should raise to surface immediately & brown in
  about 2 minutes.  Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown.
  Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or
  spatula to keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove with
  long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve. Sauce:  While deep-frying
  chicken, heat sauce to simmer. Add green onions & peanuts about a
  minute before serving. At the last minute, add chicken pieces to
  sauce, mix quickly & serve.

      Title: CHICKEN CONSOMME' SOUP BY JAMES BEARD~ CHEF
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 2 Quarts
 
MMMMM----------------INGREDIENTS PREVIOUSLY MADE---------------------
      2 qt Chicken Broth;
           -(See other recipe)

MMMMM-------------------ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS------------------------
      1 ea Egg white; beaten to a froth
      1 ea Eggshell; crushed; from
           -above egg.
 
  For chicken consomme' the broth must be absolutely fat-free and
  clear. Put the previously made Double Chicken Broth (see other
  recipe) back into an 4 quart pan and boil slowly until it has reduced
  to one half or one third its original volume. To remove any lingering
  traces of fat, strain into a 2-1/2 quart pan through a sieve lined
  with cheesecloth or a linen towel. To clarify the stock, add 1 egg
  white, beaten to a froth, and 1 crushed eggshell. Over medium heat,
  beat well with a rotary beater or a wire whisk until the stock comes
  to a boil and the egg white rises to the surface (it will have
  gathered together any impurities in the soup that would cloud it).
  Stop stirring, remove pan from the heat, and let it stand for 5
  minutes, to settle. Then, without agitating the stock, strain it
  through a sieve or colander lined with several thicknesses of damp
  cheesecloth, or a linen towel that you have wrung out in cold water.
  This traps the impurities in the egg white and any vestige of fat
  that might remain is chilled by the damp cloth. The liquid should
  just drip through into the bowl beneath it. Don't attempt to hurry
  the process or you won't get a perfectly clear consomme'. When it has
  all dripped through, pour into plastic containers, cool, and then
  freeze.

  heat 2 tablespoons oil over high heat. When oil is very hot add
  chicken, a few pieces at a time, and sear until browned on all sides,
  about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon remove chicken to a plate and
  continue until all pieces are browned.
  
  Add remaining oil and onions to pan, reduce heat to medium-high and
  fry 30 minutes until light brown, stirring constantly to prevent
  burning. Add garlic and ginger and fry 5 minutes. Add cinnamon and
  cardamom and fry 2 minutes, until spices are puffed and beginning to
  brown. Add turmeric and cayenne and stir rapidly 15 seconds. Return
  chicken to pan and stir in tomatoes, salt and 2 cups boiling water.
  Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook about 45 minutes, until
  chicken is tender and gravy has thickened. Check frequently, and add
  a little water if sauce is evaporating too quickly. Turn off heat and
  let dish rest, covered at least 1 hour, preferably 2. When ready to
  serve, reheat, fold in cumin and cilantro, and adjust seasonings if
  needed.

      Title: CHICKEN CURRY NORTH INDIAN STYLE
 Categories: Indian, Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Chicken - drumsticks, thighs
           Breast piece
      1 sm Carton Plain Yogurt
      2 md Onions very finely chopped
      4 tb Vegetable oil
      2    Cloves
    1/2 ts Mustard Powder
      2    Pods Cardamom
    1/2 ts Cumin powder
      1 ts Garam Masala
      1 ts Chilli Powder
    1/2    Inch Ginger
      4    Pods Garlic
    1/3 ts Coriander Seeds
           To taste Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
 
  1. Remove fat from the chicken.  Salt and pepper the chicken.
  Sprinkle with chili powder.  Add yogurt and mix  well  till  the
  chicken is covered liberally  with  yogurt.   Use your hands. Set
  aside for 1 hour before cooking.  If kept in the refrigerator, set
  aside for at least 4 hours. 2. Heat  oil  in a large heavy pan.  When
  oil is hot, add mustard seeds if using mustard seeds.  Add cloves,
  cardamom, and coriander seeds. Fry for 30 seconds. 3. Add the onion
  and fry for two minutes till onion beings to turn.  Lower heat to
  medium. 4. Add the ginger garlic paste and fry for 4 - 6 minutes. 5.
  Add mustard powder if using powder, add garam masala, add cumin
  powder. 6. Brush excess yogurt off the chicken and put in a large
  pot.  Add ingredients from frying pan.  Cook uncovered over high heat
  for 4 minutes. 7. Reduce heat to low and cover. Cook for 25 minutes
  or till the chicken is tender, stirring every 5 minutes. 8. Important
  note: When chicken is cooked with a cover on the pot, it releases
  water that becomes a part  of  the sauce.  If after 10 minutes, there
  isn't enough sauce in the pot,  add  1/4  cup water. Conversely if
  there is too much liquid in the pot, cook uncovered till the liquid
  evaporates.
  
  Variations There are several variations to the above recipe:
  
  1. Leave out the yogurt. Add 1/4 cup of water just before turning the
  heat to low and covering the pot. 2. Boil two potatoes for 10 minutes
  before slicing them thinly. Add potatoes into the pot when you start
  cooking the chicken. 3. This variation  is  usually called "Malai
  Chicken" or literally "creamy" chicken. Leave out the yogurt. When
  the chicken is 3/4 done, add one small can of tomato paste.   Just
  before removing a small carton of whipping cream and cook for a few
  minutes.

  THAI food seems to have erupted into British life over the past few
  years, particularly in pubs, where many have ditched sausages and
  chips for Nam Tok, Tom Yam Gung or Grat Doo Moo Nueng Dow Jeow - the
  latter being Thai spare ribs. Alongside this explosion runs the
  increasing availability of the ingredients necessary to produce these
  dishes - lemon grass, kaffir lime, galangal and a few cookery books
  to explain the process.
  
  Vatcharin Bhumichitr wants us not only to cook Thai food, but to
  understand it. His latest book, Vatch's Thai Cookbook (Pavilion
  17.99), groups recipes and writings under different ingredient
  headings. This approach, he hopes, will enable readers to appreciate
  the subtleties and origins of this intrinsically delicate cuisine. Mr
  Bhumichitr owns Chiang Mai, a Thai restaurant in Soho that serves up
  the sort of food I remember eating in Bangkok - light, delicate,
  spicy and well balanced an aspect frequently misunderstood, but well
  explained in this title. His book is full of similar recipes. Most
  are remarkably quick to cook, and ideal for that Thursday evening
  when you don't really have time to cook a stew or casserole. Today's
  recipe is from the bamboo shoots section of the book.

      2    Boneless Chicken Breasts,
           Cut into thin strips
      1    Oil

           White wine
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Marge Clark Chicken Da Vinci Saute Italian
  Sausage slices until done, remove from pan. In the grease from the
  sausages, with olive oil added as necessary, saute the garlic and
  green peppers. When peppers are about 1/2 done, add the onion. Cook
  until veggies are barely tender, still a trifle crisp, but not
  browned. Remove from pan and add to sausages. Add more oil, saute
  mushrooms until browned, remove and add to rest of the stuff. Last
  step, saute the chicken until done. Add everything else back into the
  pan, season generously with rosemary and oregano. Throwing a little
  basil in won't hurt it either. If the dish seems dry, add small
  amounts of either plain chicken broth or a broth & white wine mix. If
  you've added too much liquid, then thicken it with cornstarch.

  2 1/2 lb Chicken Joints
      4 md Onions -- peeled
  1 1/2    Inch Cube Of Ginger --
           Peeled & chopped
      6    Cloves Garlic -- peeled
      7 tb Vegetable Oil
      1 tb Ground Coriander Seeds
      1 tb Ground Cumin Seeds
    1/2 ts Ground Turmeric
    1/2 ts Cayenne Pepper
      4 tb Plain Yogurt
  2 1/2 c  Water
      2 md Tomatoes, Peeled -- very

      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Garam Masala -- (essential)
      1 tb Fresh Cilantro -- finely
           Chopped
 
  Cut chicken into serving pieces. Whole legs should be separated into
  drumsticks and thighs. Whole breasts should be cut into 4-6 pieces,
  depending on their size. Skin all the chicken pieces.
  
  Chop half of the onions coarsely. Cut the remaining onions into halves
  lengthwise, and then crosswise into very thin slices. [This is the key
  step!].
  
  Put CHOPPED onions, ginger, and garlic into a food processor and
  blend to a paste. Heat oil in a large, wide pot or deep-frying pan
  (nonstick) over a medium flame. When hot, put in the SLICED onions
  and stir fry them until they are deep, reddish-brown. Remove the
  onions with a slotted spoon, squeezing out and leaving behind as much
  oil as possible. Set aside onions in a plate.
  
  Remove pot/pan from flame. Put in blended paste (watch out for
  sputtering!). Put the pot back to heat. Stir and fry the paste until
  it is brown, about 3-4 minutes. Now put in the coriander, cumin,
  turmeric and cayenne; stir once. Put in 1 tab of yogurt. Stir about
  30 seconds or until yogurt is incorporated into sauce. Do the same
  with remaining yogurt, 1 tab. at a time. Put in the chicken pieces
  and stir them around for a minute.
  
  Pour in water, add the tomatoes and salt. Stir to mix and bring to
  simmer. Cover, turn heat to low and cook 20 minutes. Sprinkle in the
  garam masala and the fried onions. Mix. Cook, uncovered, on medium
  heat for 7-8 minutes or until the sauce reduces and thickens.
  
  Skim off the fat and put the chicken in a warm serving dish. Sprinkle
  the green cilantro over the top.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Onions, chopped
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/2 tb Stock, chicken, powdered
      4 oz Cream, sour

MMMMM-------------------------ENCHILADAS------------------------------
      1 c  Chicken, cooked; chopped
      1 c  Cheese, cheddar, shredded
    1/2 cn Green chilies; drained
      1 oz Pimientos, sliced
    1/4 ts Chili powder
      6 lg Tortillas, flour
    1/4 c  Cheese, cheddar, shredded
 
  Sauce: Cook onion in butter until tender. Stir in flour, water and
  bouillon; cook and stir until sauce thickens and bouillon dissolves.
  Remove from heat; stir in sour cream.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Combine chicken, cheese, chilies, pimientos,
  chili powder, and enough sauce to moisten; mix well. Dip each
  tortilla into sauce to soften; fill each with equal portions of
  chicken mixture and roll up. Arrange in a lightly greased 13x9"
  baking dish; spoon remaining sauce over enchiladas.  Sprinkle with
  cheese and parsley.  Bake
       25    minutes, or until bubbly.
  
  Serve with additional sour cream, if desired.
  
  Sylvia's comments: I've never tried making enchiladas before, and was
  surprised and delighted at how easy they were. The sauce was blah and
  didn't suit the enchiladas at all, but I have lots of sauce recipes!
  So I'm going to make it again, substituting some other sauces for
  this one. Also, I left this sitting in the fridge two days before
  baking it, with no negative result except it took longer than 25
  minutes to get it hot.

           NOTE:  By Donna Tomlinson
           Try using NO FAT sour cream
           And it comes out very good.
 
      Cook chicken in 12-16 cups of water until done. Debone chicken and
  reserve broth.  In a large saute pan, combine margarine, onion and
  garlic. Gradually add flour, seasoned salt and paprika. This will

  can add more reserved tomato liquid if sauce gets too thick too
  quickly.) Remove tomato sauce from heat and set aside.

  tortillas in hot oil for a few seconds, or just until they become
  limp. Drain well on paper towels. Fill tortillas with chicken

      Title: CHICKEN ENCHILADAS VERDES
 Categories: Mexican, Chicken, Casseroles
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Fresh poblano peppers (4
           -medium)
      1 lb Skinned, boneless cooked
           -chicken, at room
           -temperature or warm
    1/2 c  Lightly packed cilantro
           -leaves
           Salt, to taste
  1 1/2 lb Fresh tomatillos, husks
           -removed and rinsed (OR
           -drained and rinsed canned
           -tomatillos)
      2 c  Chicken stock, divided
  1 1/2 c  Vegetable oil, divided
     12    Corn tortillas (6-inch
           -diameter)
      2 oz Chihuahua or Muenster
           -cheese, chilled
      1 md Tomato, peeled and seeded
    1/2 c  Sour cream (about)
 
  Char, peel, and seed the poblano peppers and set them aside. Shred the
  chicken by pulling it apart with your fingers or by processing it
  with a medium (4-mm) food processor slicing disk. There should be 3
  to 4 cups. Set aside.
  
  To make the green salsa, mince the cilantro in a dry food processor
  fitted with the metal blade.  Add the roasted poblano peppers and 1/4
  teaspoon of salt; process until minced. Add the tomatillos and
  process until the mixture is pureed, slowly adding 1 cup of the
  stock. Process until smooth.
  
  Transfer the salsa to a nonreactive skillet large enough to hold a
  flat tortilla.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and 3/4 cup of the
  remaining stock. Simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, about 15
  minutes. Adjust the seaonings, adding 1/4 teaspoon of salt or more,
  as needed. Set the sauce aside in the skillet. (The sauce can be
  covered and refrigerated in a bowl for 48 hours.)
  
  Heat the remaining oil in a large, heavy skilet to 325 degrees. Layer
  paper towels on a baking sheet with additional toweling nearby. To
  seal each tortilla, slip it into the hot oil for 15 to 20 seconds,
  turning it once. Ust tongs to transfer the tortillas to the paper
  towels and blot to remove any excess oil. Repeat with the remaining
  tortillas.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 F and adjust the oven rack to the middle
  position. To assemble the casseerole, work on the tortillas one at a
  time as follows: warm the sauce and dip a sealed tortilla into the
  sauce, coating each side. Rest the tortilla in a 15-by-10-by-3-inch
  baking dish (use glass, porcelain, enamel, or earthenware,as the
  sauce is acidic). Put a generous half cup of the shredded chicken on
  each tirtilla, roll it up, and put it seam-side down in the dish,
  starting aty one end. Place the rolled tortillas snugly side by side
  in the dish and work on top of the rolled tortillas as the dish fills
  up so that no sauce is lost.
  
  Shred the cheese.  Stir the remaining broth into the remaining sauce,
  and heat it simmering--the sauce will thicken slightly. Adjust the
  seasoning and spread all of the remaining sauce over the enchiladas
  (rolled tortillas).  Sprinkle with the cheese.  Cover the dish with
  aluminum foil. Bake until a sharp knife inserted into the enchiladas
  is withdrawn hot, about 18 to 20 minutes.
  
  Coarsely chop the tomato.  Serve the enchiladas by spooning them out
  of the baking dish.  Garnish each portion with a generous spoonful of
  sour cream and some chopped tomato.

MMMMM-------------------------ENCHILADAS------------------------------
      2    Whole chicken breasts
           -boneless and skinless
      2 tb Minced onion
    1/3 c  Sour cream
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      8    Corn tortillas
      1 c  Sharp cheddar cheese
           -coarsely grated
    1/2 c  Crumbled asiago cheese
           -or substitute additional
           -cheddar or jack cheese
 
  1. TO MAKE THE SAUCE.  Husk and wash the tomatillos. Bring a pan of
  water to the boil, add the tomatillos and jalapeno peppers and time
  for 10 minutes.  Drain and remove the stem ends of the peppers. Put
  the tomatillos, peppers, onion and garlic in a food processor and
  process to a coarse puree.
  
  2. In a large pan heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the
  vegetable puree and simmer 2 minutes. Stir in the broth and salt;
  simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside.
  
  3. TO MAKE THE ENCHILADAS.  Place the chicken in a large saucepan and
  cover with cold water.  Bring just to a boil, reduce the heat, cover
  and simmer until cooked through. Remove the chicken from the water
  and cool slightly. Shred the chicken and set aside.
  
  4. Combine the cooled, shredded chicken with the minced onion, sour
  cream, and salt.  Stir in 1/4 cup of the tomatillo sauce. Set aside.
  
  5. In a 9- to 10-inch frying pan heat the oil over medium-high heat.
  Put 1 tortilla at a time in the hot oil and fry about 30 seconds on
  each side. Drain on paper towels. Cool slightly.
  
  6. Spread a little of the sauce in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. Spoon
  some of the filling down the center of each tortilla and roll. Place
  in the baking dish; it will be a tight fit. Spoon the sauce over the
  enchiladas and sprinkle with the cheddar and asiago cheeses.
  
  7. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven 25 minutes. Cool 5 minutes
  before serving.

           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 pn Nutmeg
    1/2 lb Fresh spinach; washed and
           - chopped coarsely, -=OR=-
    1/2 pk -Frozen Spinach, defrosted
           - squeezed of all water
      6 sl Boiled ham (thin slices)
      6 sl Fontina cheese (thin slices)
      2    Eggs
  1 1/2 tb Whipping cream
    1/2 tb Chopped parsley
    1/3 c  Parmesan cheese
    1/2 c  Flour
    2/3 c  Vegetable oil
      8 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
    1/2 c  Brown sauce
      1    Lemon; juice only
 
  SKIN BREASTS (skins may be used later for stock); trim off all
  gristle and fat. Cut breasts in half and butterfly each half (slice
  each half lengthwise, leaving 1 side uncut). Place on waxed paper and
  gently flatten with a meat mallet until pieces are quite thin. Season
  with salt and pepper and nutmeg. Steam fresh spinach in 3/4 cup
  salted water for 3 minutes and drain well. If using frozen spinach,
  simply drain well when completely defrosted. Place equal amounts of
  spinach in center of each half of chicken, cover with a slice of ham
  and press down edges of chicken together, then seal edges with a meat
  mallet. Beat eggs in a mixing bowl, add cream, parsley and Parmesan
  cheese, and blend well. Dust chicken lightly with flour and dip in
  egg batter, 1 piece at a time, making sure to coat heavily. Heat oil
  in a skillet until very hot, and saute each piece separately until
  crisp and golden in color. Trim edges of any excess egg batter and
  transfer chicken to a warm platter. Melt butter in frying pan large
  enough to accommodate all the chicken. Add wine and cook until it
  evaporates--about 5-or-6 minutes. Add brown sauce, cook 5 minutes.
  Then place chicken in pan, cook 5 minutes. Add lemon juice and cook
  additional 3 minutes. Turn once. Cook another 5 minutes. Place

           -sticks
 
  In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Using a pastry
  blender, cut in butter and shortening until mixture resembles coarse
  meal (work quickly so the butter does not soften). Sprinkle with ice
  water; rapidly blend together with a fork. Gather the dough into a
  ball, then flatten into a circle. Wrap in foil; chill at least 3
  hours or overnight. For filling, place chicken, water, bay leaf and
  garlic in a Dutch oven. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and cook for
  30-40 minutes or until chicken is tender. Rem ove and debone chicken;
  set aside. Skim fat from the stock. Add beans, carrots, potatoes and

  minutes. Drain vegetables and reserve stock; set aside. Melt butter
  in another large kettle. Whisk in flour and cook until bubbly; stir
  in 1-1/2 cups of reserved stock. Discard remaining stock. In a small
  bowl, stir together cream and egg yolks. Whisk into the sauce; remove
  from heat.

  vegetables. To assemble flowerpots, brush the outside of pots with
  vegetable oil. Line each pot with a 15-in. x 12-in. piece of foil;
  pressing the foil gently down into the pot and being careful not to
  tear it. Fill each pot with about 1-1/2 cups of filling; leaving
  about 1/2-in. headroom; set aside. Roll pastry to 1/8-in. thickness;
  cut six 6-in. circles. Place one circle on each flowerpot, turndown
  the edges and flute the ends. Cut three sma ll steam holes in the
  center of each pastry. In a small bowl, lightly beat glaze
  ingredients; brush on top of each crust. Place flowerpots on a baking
  sheet. Bake at 425! for 30-35 minutes or until the crust is browned
  and the filling's hot and bubbly. Place one stick with a seed packet
  in each pot before serving.

      1    Celery stalk

  flesh from bones in large pieces. Strain liquid. Cut mushrooms into
  thin slices. Sautee in a small amount of butter in a medium skillet.
  Melt butter in a large skillet. Stir in flour. Cook, stirring

  Worcestershire sauce, wine and lemon juice. Place chicken pieces,
  sauteed mushrooms and peas in sauce; warm gently over low heat. When
  all ingredients are hot, turn off heat. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes.

      Title: CHICKEN FRICASSEE - LOW FAT
 Categories: Chicken, Low-cal
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2    Chicken - about 1 lb.,
           -skinned & all fat cut away
    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Flour - all purpose
      1    Egg white
    1/4 c  Skim milk
           -Country Rice (see recipe)
    1/4 c  Dry brown "roux" - see
           -recipe
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Onion - chopped
    1/2 c  Green onion - chopped
      2    Clove garlic - minced
      1 tb Parsley - finely chopped
    1/8 ts Allspice - ground
    1/4 ts Thyme
    1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  PREPARATION: Preheat the oven to 350F. Cut the chicken into pieces.
  Blend the paprika and pepper with the flour. Beat the egg white with
  the milk. Dip the chicken into the egg white mixture and then into
  the seasoned flour. Lay the chicken in a baking pan and bake for 30
  minutes, or until golden brown. While the chicken is baking, make the
  Country Rice. MAKE THE FRICASSEE GRAVY: Put the "roux" into a
  saucepan and blend in the water a little at a time so there are no
  lumps and the sauce is smooth. Add all remaining ingredients, cover
  and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the
  oven and add it to the pot with the Fricassee gravy. Let all simmer
  for another 15 minutes, or until the hicken is very tender and easily
  comes off the bones. TO SERVE: Spoon the Chicken Fricassee onto
  plates and accompany with the Country Rice. NOTES: The chicken is
  even good served just out of the oven without the Fricassee gravy.
  Tastes like fried! There are few dishes that appeal to me more than a
  good Chicken fricassee. This dish is one of my favorites in this
  book. VARIATION: The skinned chicken breasts you buy at the grocery,
  or skinless turkey breasts cut into strips, both make an excellent
  Fricassee. Suggested Menu: Green Salad with Creamy Creole Dressing
  Chicken Fricassee Country Rice Pineapple with Port Wine

  the gravy. -Milk Gravy drain most all of the oil out of the pan, and
  add about 1/2 stick of butter or marg. -Stir around good over medium

  with a flat spatula to get it all mixed up. When desired consistency,
  remove from heat and serve with the steak. -Try serving with
  Black-eyed peas and lots of mashed potatoes or  rice.

           -pieces
     11    Cloves garlic, crushed

      2 tb Corn or vegetable oil
     20 sm New potatoes, peeled
    3/4 c  Red wine vinegar
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      2 ts Salt
      6    Bay leaves
      2 tb Each dried thyme and
           -marjoram
      2    Chiles serranos (optional)
 
  Hey++just found this one in a Cookbook Digest.  It might work well in
  the Romertopf.  Or the Chinese sandy pots for that matter.
  
  The traditional way to prepare this chicken dish from Michoacan, is
  in a clay casserole dish covered with a sealing layer of ground corn
  or masa. Small bits of the corn mixture break off and add a
  thickening texture to the sauce.  This modern version is much simpler
  to prepare.
  
  Rub the chicken with the garlic, salt, and pepper and refrigerate for
  2 to 4 hours.
  
  In a large skillet, heat the corn oil, saute the chicken briefly and
  transfer to a cazuela or large pot. In the same oil, lightly brown the
  potatoes, remove, and set aside. Add the vinegar to the skillet and
  bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the
  skillet. Pour the vinegar through a strainer over the chicken.
  
  Add the olive oil, salt, bay leaves, thyme, and marjoram to the
  chicken cazuela.  Bring to a boil over high heat, cover, and lower
  the heat. Every 10 minutes, uncover and stir. After 35 minutes,
  uncover, correct the seasonings, and add the chiles and potatoes.
  Cover and cook over low heat until the potatoes are tender, about 15
  minutes.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 ea Chicken
      3 tb Butter
    1/2 tb Mustard, Dijon
    1/2 c  Juice, orange
    1/4 c  Sugar, brown
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Water
    1/8 c  Vodka
 
  Cut chickens in half lengthwise.  Blend butter and mustard together.
  Rub chicken inside and out with this mixture. Place chicken, skin
  side down, in baking dish with tight-fitting cover.
  
  Preheat oven to 375. Combine orange juice and brown sugar, stirring
  until sugar is completely dissolved. Pour over and around chicken.
  Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
  
  Turn chicken over, baste with pan juices, and continue to bake,
  uncovered, for 20 minutes longer, basting occasionally.
  
  Remove chicken to heated platter and keep warm.  Mix cornstarch with
  water. Stir this into juices from pan. Cook over low heat, stirring
  constantly, until thickened. Remove from heat, stir in vodka, and
  pour sauce over chicken.
  
  Sylvia's comments: I'm unenthusiastic about this one, and I'm not
  sure why. The chicken was pretty bland, but chicken usually tastes
  bland to me, and the sauce was certainly flavorful. The combination
  of mustard and orange juice didn't do a thing for my taste buds. It
  also took about 1/2 hour longer to bake than the recipe called for.
  Next time, I think I'll leave out the mustard/butter rub, add a
  little pumpkin pie spice to the orange juice/brown sugar mixture, and
  cook the whole mess in the crockpot rather than the oven.

    450 g  Uncooked chicken

     30 ml Lemon juice
     30 ml Fish sauce (nampla)

      4    Cloves garlic
      1 tb Chili oil or red pepper
           Flakes (optional)
 
  1.  Cut up chicken into bite-size pieces, then marinate for 45-60
  minutes in a mixture of the marinade ingredients.
  
  2.  Cook rice noodles and drain them.
  
  3.  Dump the chicken and marinade into large skillet and stir on high
  heat until chicken is cooked.
  
  4.  Mix cooked chicken and marinade into the noodles. Also mix in
  cilantro, green onions and peanuts.
  
  5.  Garnish with french-fried onion. If you mix this in instead of
  adding it on top, the onions get soggy too quickly.

      1 tb Butter
      1 md Garlic clove, minced
      1 c  Chicken stock or low-salt

      1 c  Heavy cream

           -chicken breast halves
           Salt and freshly ground

      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2 tb Chopped fresh basil (or 2
           -tsp dried, crumbled)
      8 oz Fettucine
 
  Snip the tomatoes into bite-size pieces.  Melt the butter in a
  saucepan over low heat; add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add
  3/4 cup of the stock and the tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce the
  heat and simmer, uncovered, over medium heat for about 10 minutes or
  until the tomatoes are tender.  Add the cream and bring to a boil,
  stirring. Simmer over medium heat until the sauce is thick enough to
  coat the back of a spoon. (The sauce can be kept, covered, for 1 day
  in the refrigerator. Heat again over low heat.) Sprinkle the chicken
  with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat the oil in a large, heavy
  skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and saute, pressing on
  the chicken occasionally with a slotted spatula, for about 4 minutes
  per side or until the meat feels springy and is no longer pink inside
  (cut to check). Transfer to a board; cover and keep warm.
  
  Discard the fat from the skillet.  Add the remaining stock and bring
  to a boil, stirring up the pan juices. Boil to reduce slightly, then
  add to the sauce.  Stir in the basil. Taste and adjust the seasoning.
  Meanwhile, cook the pasta, uncovered, in a large port of boiling
  salted water over high heat, stirring occasionally (about 1 to 2
  minutes for fresh or 3 to 5 minutes for dried fettucine), or until
  tender but firm to the bite (al dente).  Drain, transfer to bowl and
  toss with 3 or 4 tablespoons of the sauce. Cut each chicken breasts
  into 2 or 3 diagonal slices. Reheat gently in the sauce if needed.
  Transfer the pasta to serving plates, top with the chicken and coat
  with sauce.

      Title: CHICKEN IN TERRACOTTA
 Categories: Poultry, Entrees
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken
      3 tb Dijon mustard
      1    Garlic clove
           Sea salt and black pepper
      3    Sprigs chervil
      3    Sprigs tarragon
      3    Sprigs dill
      3    Sprigs parsely
      2    Sprigs lemon thyme
      1    Sprig marjoram
      1 tb Olive oil

MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
 
  Thick terracotta pots (chicken bricks or romertopf) especially for
  baking chickens in can be bought now in many kitchen shops; they are
  foolproof to use, and keep the oven clean.
  
  Paint the bird all over with mustard and lay it in the bottom half of
  the terracotta pot. Cut the peeled clove of garlic in half and rub it
  over the inside of the pot. Rub the skin of the bird with salt and
  pepper. Scatter the herbs over the bird, tucking some inside it. Pour
  the olive oil over the chicken and close the pot.
  
  Place in a cold oven, turn up the heat as high as it will go and
  leave for 1 - 1 1/2 hours. Take the pot out of the oven and remove
  the bird. Carve the chicken and arrange the pieces on a serving
  platter. Strain the cooking juices from the pot, discarding the
  herbs, and pour the juices over the carved chicken. Serve with rice
  or noodles and a green salad.

  with a whole utility frying chicken. Bones and skin can be cooked up
  in a separate pot for stock.
  
  Pour tomatoes into container of a blender or food processor. Add
  basil, tarragon, salt and papper. Puree until smooth. Melt margarine
  in a large frypan. Saute garlic over medium heat 1 min. (or mix in
  1/2 tsp garlic powder with other spices)
  
  Add chicken pieces, saute, turning once or twice until golden on both
  sides.  Cover with tomato mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
  simmer 15 min until tender. Remove chicken and place in a warm
  oven-proof dish. Stir parsley into sauce and spoon over chicken.
  Sprinkle with Mozzarella. Place under heated broiler 1 min just until
  cheese melts.
  
  Or place on a microwave-safe dish and melt cheese in microwave. Or
  sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese and serve immediately.

 Categories: Poultry, Sauces
      Yield: 24 Kabobs
 
      2 tb Tamari or dark soy sauce
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 tb Molasses
      1 tb Cooking oil
      2 ts Lime juice
      2 ts Grated fresh ginger
      4 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Dried red-pepper flakes
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 lb Boneless, skinless chicken
           Breasts, cut in 1/4" cubes
      1    Mango, peeled and chopped
      1 cl Garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Minced Jalapeno pepper
      3 tb Rice-wine vinegar or cider
           Vinegar
 
  1.  In a medium glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the ysmsri,
  Worcestershire sauce, molasses, oil, lime juice, ginger, 1 teaspoon
  of the sugar, the red-pepper flakes and salt. Add the chicken and
  toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least an
  hour.
  
  2.  In a shallow dish, soak 24 six-inch wooden skewers in water for at
  least 30 minutes.
  
  3.  Make the dipping sauce.  In a medium stainless-steel sauce pan,
  combine the mango, garlic, jalapeno, the remaining 3 teaspoons of
  sugar and the vinegar and bring to a simmer over moderately low heat.
  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mango is soft, about 15
  minutes. Transfer to a food processor or blender and pulse or blend
  briefly to a coarse puree. Let cool.
  
  4.  Heat the broiler.  Drain the chicken and thread 2 pieces onto each
  skewer  Put the skewers on a baking sheet and broil, turning once,
  until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes in all. Serve with
  the dipping sauce.
  
  (Note:  There is a trick to removing the flesh from a mango. Stand the
  unpeeled mango on end and, using a sharp knife, slice down through
  the skin and flesh, as close as possible to the pit, to remove the
  flesh in one piece.  Repeat on the other side.  With the two pieces
  skin-side down, score the flesh into cubes, taking care not to cut
  through the skin. Turn the skin "inside out" and slice off the cubes
  of fruit.)

  Flatten the chicken breasts to a thickness of about 1/4 " by placing
  them between pieces of wax paper and pounding them lightly with a
  rolling pin or flat sided kitchen mallet. Lay out the breasts boned
  side up (the unsmooth side). Salt to taste and sprinkle with the
  pepper and chives. Place a finger of butter on each breast half. Roll
  up the butter in thebreast meat as you would wrap a package, tucking
  in the ends at the beginning. Dip the rolled breasts in flour, then
  in the beaten eggs and finally in the bread crumbs. Chill in the
  fridge for about 3 hours or more. Heat the oil to 365*F in a saucepan
  or deep skillet. The oil should be deep enough to cover the breasts.
  A Fry Daddy works great here. Deep fry the breasts for 4-5 minutes
  uncrowded or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve
  immediately. If frying in batches, keep others warm in an oven. I
  like these served with warm Hollandaise sauce and a very slight
  sprinkle of dill for color.   Enjoy GUY FROM: GUY ATTWOOD (NFWF89A)

     20    Cloves, whole
     12    Green cardamom seeds,
           -whole, cracked
           -(or less; or use 2 t
           -of ground cardamom)
      5    Bay leaves
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Coriander (ground)
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
           -(or more to taste)
      8 oz Yogurt, plain
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  Cut the chicken breasts into bite-size pieces and set aside. Peel the
  onions and chop them fine. You should have about 3 cups of onion.
  Mince the garlic and add to the bowl of chopped onions.
  
  In a big frypan that has a lid, heat the butter and oil, then saute
  the onions and garlic for about 10 minutes, until the first hint of
  browning. Use "medium-high" heat.
  
  Crack the cardamom seeds between your fingers, just to get the shell
  open. Add them to the pan.  Add the ginger, cloves, bay leaves and
  salt. Saute until the onions are nice and brown, about 5 more minutes.
  
  Mix the coriander and red pepper with the yogurt.  Add the yogurt to
  the frypan, stirring as you pour, slowly enough that the onion
  doesn't stop bubbling.  It could take several minutes to do this,
  depending on the diameter of your frypan. When the last of the yogurt
  dries up, add the chicken pieces and brown them. Add 1/2 cup water,
  reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes.
  
  Stir in the milk and turn off the heat.  It needs to sit a few
  minutes to let the flavors blend. The longer you let it sit after
  cooking, the better it will taste (up to several hours).
  
  While the chicken is sitting, cook some rice.  I make saffron rice to
  go with this dish.
  
  Fish out the bay leaves and as many of the whole cloves as you can
  find, before serving.  Americans don't seem to like to eat whole
  cloves in their food. Check to make sure it is moist enough (it
  should have the consistency of applesauce). Reheat over low heat.
  Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indian braised chicken with onions, cloves and ginger -- I learned
  to like Indian food in London, where delicious Indian food can be had
  in simple restaurants at hamburger prices and the fare at fancy
  places ranks among the finest food on Earth. Back in America, to
  satisfy my new craving for good Indian food I had to learn to cook it
  myself. This is a Friday-night supper dish in our family, too complex
  for a weekday meal, and too plain to serve to company.
  
  Indian food is often quite elaborate, so by their standards this is a
  fast and simple dish. It is a classical Indian recipe, found in many
  cookbooks.
  
  *  Indians put a lot more salt in their cooking than this recipe
  calls for; if you want to make it more authentic you should double
  the salt. Indians also don't like chicken skin and will go to great
  lengths to prevent even small pieces of chicken skin from getting
  into the food. I rather like chicken skin myself, and I don't try
  very hard to keep it out of this dish.
  
  *  If you can't find green cardamom seeds, don't bother using white
  ones, they've been bleached and processed and don't have much flavor
  left. Use ground cardamom instead.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (timing is somewhat important)
  : Time:  1 hour plus "sitting time."
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHICKEN LIVER STROGANOFF
 Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Chicken livers
    1/2 lb Cap mushrooms
      2    Onions
  1 1/2 oz Unsalted or clarified butter
    1/2 pt Soured cream
      3 tb Fairly acid yoghurt
 
  Thoroughly heat a large saute or frying pan.  Add a scant 1/2 oz of
  the butter and tilt so that the fat runs sizzling all over the pan
  base. Add the mushrooms (whole if small or sliced thickly if large)
  and saute over high heat for 5 minutes.  Remove and keep hot.
  
  Add the rest of the butter to the pan, then the onions which should be
  thinly sliced and pushed into rings. Cook very gently indeed for 15-20
  minutes until beautifully softened. Meanwhile stir the yoghurt into
  the soured cream and season very generously with salt and pepper;
  trim the chicken livers and pat them dry with kitchen paper.
  
  Lift the onions out of the pan with a slotted spoon, so all the
  buttery juices drip back into the pan, and keep them hot. Increase
  the heat under the pan and saute the chicken livers for about 3
  minutes so they become crusted with brown on the outside, but remain
  deliciously pink and tender within.
  
  Return the mushrooms and onions to the pan and immediately pour on the
  seasoned soured cream.  Let the sauce bubble up and cook for a few
  minutes until it is very hot, slightly reduced and thickened. Stir
  gently every now and again to encourage the sauce to cling creamily
  to the meat and vegetables.  Check seasoning and serve without delay.
  Green beans and triangles of fried bread go well with this dish, and
  I like to accompany it with plenty of crusty hot French bread to mop
  up every luscious drop of sauce.  More substantially, you could
  substitute rice or thin ribbons of pasta for the bread.

  Trim the livers of any connective tissue and any greenish spots from

  pan, add the liver pieces and onion, sprinkle lightly with salt, and
  fry, tossing them almost constantly - a stir-fry if you will- for

  Speaking of spaghetti, I gave a recital last Sunday, and my pianist
  and I arrived at the hall (out of breath, hungry, dusty, tired) early
  to warm up and try the piano out - but there was another function
  going on, so we couldn't use the piano and thus had an hour to waste.
  What to do? Luckily, there was one of those hole-in-the-wall Chinese
  takeout places down the street (turned out to be darn good), so I had:
  
  House special lo mein (this an adaptation of Joyce Chen's recipe) I
  was served half of this as a "half order" for $4.65, and it was too
  much, so I suppose it makes enough for about 3 as a main course
  
  Bring a lot of water to the boil. Dump noodles in; turn heat to low.
  Cook 3 minutes. Drain, toss with sesame oil and regular oil, set
  aside.
  
  In 4 separate dishes, combine each of the meats with
      1/2 t  sherry and
      1/2 t  cornstarch.
  
  Heat the 4 T oil in a skillet or wok to high. Add meats in this order,
  stirring for a few seconds between each addition: pork, beef, chicken,
  shrimp. As soon as you've added and tossed the shrimp, add the
  mushrooms and cabbage. Cook until cabbage is wilted. Add scallions,
  soy, salt, and MSG. Stir. Add the noodles and the bean sprouts, and
  stir-cook for 3 min. Serve hot on a warm platter.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Vegetable oil or ghee
      2    Chicken breasts, skinned
           And cut into 1 inch cubes
      6    (more for a vindaloo) whole
           Small Dried chiles (bird's
           Eye chiles)
    1/2 ts Good chile powder
      1 ts Ground cumin

           -minutes
    1/2 ts Garam masala
 
  This is a hot, simple curry. Hike up the chiles for a vindaloo !!!
  Watch out for the whole dried chiles though - they heat up the dish
  slowly so don't adjust the chile level too soon (unless you're a
  Chile-Head, in which case add a few more !!) A. Heat a little of the
  oil in a large heavy frying pan then fry the chicken pieces over
  moderate heat until they are sealed and have turned white. Remove
  them from the pan and set aside B. heat the rest of the oil in a
  heavy pan over a moderate heat C. add the whole dried chiles and fry
  until they start to swell D. turn the heat to low and let the pan
  cool a little then put in the chile powder, cumin and coriander and
  fry for 10 seconds stirring all the time (do not burn or it will
  taste bitter!) then quickly....... E. Put in the curry sauce, salt
  and chicken pieces and cook for 30 minutes, stirring from time to
  time F. 10 minutes from the end add the garam masala and fenugreek
  leaves G. Simmer gently for the last 10 minutes stirring frequently

      1 lb 4 oz red potatoes, cut into
           1/8" thick slices
    1/4 c  White wine vinegar
           Option: Instead of the whole
           .chicken, you can use 2-3
           .whole skinned chicken
           .breasts, cut in halves
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 375F.  Spray an 8" square baking pan with
  non-stick cooking spray.
  
  2.  In a large bowl, combine the oil, garlic, salt, cinnamon, and
  pepper. Add chicken and potatoes; toss well to coat thoroughly.
  
  3.  Arrange chicken in a single layer in prepared baking pan; add
  vinegar, then top evenly with potatoes. Bake 40-50 minutes, until
  potatoes are tender, chicken is cooked thoroughly and thigh juices
  run clear when pierced with a fork.  Serve topped with pan juices.
  
  Lin's notes:  Since we don't like dark meat, I used 2-3 whole skinned
  chicken breasts, cut in halves, and then cut in half again. I also
  peeled the potatoes, as Pat doesn't like potato skins. It turned out
  great! I served this with a green salad and white wine.

 Categories: Info, Poultry
      Yield: 3 Ounces
 
           No ingredients
 
  Buying Guide (serving sizes): =============================
  
     As a guide to buying amounts of chicken, the Delmarva Poultry
  Association suggests that an average "serving" of chicken for people
  is:
  
     :     1/2 to 3/4 of a pound of whole chicken
     :     1 chicken breast half, with or without bone
     :     1 chicken leg (thigh and drumstick attached)
     :     2 chicken thighs or drumsticks
     :     3 chicken wings Handling and Storing Chicken at Home:
  =====================================
  
     The United States enjoys the safest, most wholesome supply of fresh
  chicken available worldwide.  But keep in mind that chicken is an
  animal agricultural product and, like all such products, it can carry
  certain microorganisms, most of which are harmless.  Even if harmful
  bacteria are present, the numbers are usually far below levels that
  would cause human illness if the product is handled safely and cooked
  at normal temperatures until done.  Safe handling of chicken, or any
  perishable product, isn't difficult.  These procedures included:
  
     Don't wait, refrigerate.
     ------------------------
  
     Take purchased poultry home as soon as possible and
     refrigerate for use within one to two days.  Freeze for longer
     storage.
  
     Thaw in refrigerator or microwave - not at room temperature.
  
     Don't leave cooked poultry at room temperature more than 2
     hours.
  
     Place leftovers in shallow containers and refrigerate
     promptly.
  
     Keep it clean:
     --------------
  
     Wash your hands, work surfaces, and utensils in hot soapy
     water before and after contact with raw meat and poultry.
  
     Cook thoroughly:
     ----------------
  
     Cook poultry until a meat thermometer registers 160 degrees
     Fahrenheit for boneless product, 170 degrees for bone-in parts, and
     180 degrees for bone-in whole chickens product, OR until juices run
     clear.

      Title: CHICKEN MILANAISE
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Chicken
      1 tb Salt
      3 tb Butter, unsalted
      3 tb Flour
      2    Egg yolks
      1 tb Lemon juice
      2 c  Rice, white (to serve
           -on the side)
           Salt and pepper
           -(for the sauce)
 
  Place the chicken in a pot.  Cover it with water, add the salt and
  bring it to a boil, skimming any scum that may form on the surface.
  Turn down the heat, cover the pot and cook the chicken for about 1
  hour or until it is done.
  
  Remove the chicken from the pot.  Skim and discard the chicken fat
  from the surface of the broth.  Reserve about 2 cups of broth for the
  sauce and use the remaining broth to cook the rice according to
  standard procedures for cooking rice.
  
  While the rice is cooking, make the sauce:  melt the butter under low
  heat in a saucepan and add in the flour, salt and pepper. Stir until
  you get a uniform mixture and then add the reserved broth gradually,
  stirring constantly.  When the mixture thickens, remove from the heat.
  
  Beat the egg yolks with the lemon juice and add them into the sauce.
  Stir the sauce until the egg yolks are completely blended. The sauce
  is ready. Cut the chicken and serve with sauce on both the chicken
  and the rice.
  
  Chicken with white sauce -- This is what my mother serves as Chicken
  Milanaise.  I once ordered Chicken Milanaise at a restaurant, and they
  served me an entirely different dish, so I'm not sure as to whether
  I'm using the name properly. In any case, this recipe is one of my
  favourites! Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  You are supposed to use white pepper in the sauce but, since I
  don't mind seeing a few black specs in the sauce, I always use black
  pepper.
  
  *  If you are going to reheat the sauce, make sure that it doesn't
  come to a boil, otherwise the egg will separate.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  About 1 1/2 hours.
  : Precision:  Measure the sauce ingredients.

  parsley sprigs. *** My notes: I found that 3/4 cup each parmesan and
  breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4 chicken breasts, so I
  reduced the amounts to 1/2 cup each- which is still about enough for
  6 breasts. I use Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just
  enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.

  chicken is done.  Remove chicken from pan; keep hot. To the juices in
  pan, add onions; cook until soft.  (Save a bit for garnish from the
  green tops).
  
  Add tomatoes; cook until soft as mush; add thyme (?? ~KM) and
  parsley. Salt and pepper if needed.
  
  Mix sour cream, flour, paprika; add to onions and salt. Cook until

      Title: CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP NEW ORLEANS STYLE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lg Whole fryer
      1 c  Onions; diced
    1/2 c  Celery; diced
    1/2 c  Parsley; minced
      4    Garlic clove; garlic
      1 c  Carrots; chopped
      3    Bay leaves
      1 ts Poultry seasoning
      4 qt ;Water
     12 oz Broad egg noodles
      2 tb Butter
      1 c  Onion rings; sliced
      1 c  Mushrooms; sliced
      1 c  Carrots; diced
    1/4 c  Cream sherry
           Salt & pepper; to taste
           Scallions; for garnish
 
  First, take the chicken and wash it thoroughly - that means both
  inside and out!  Remove the giblets, scrub out the internal cavity
  under cold running water, and scrape away anything that doesn't look
  edible. (But DO NOT remove the chicken skin or any of the fat!  You
  need the skin to make a rich stock.)
  
       Next, take a crock pot (see Note below if you don't have a crock
  pot) and place the chicken and giblets into it. Then drop in the
  diced onions, the 1/2 c of celery, the 1/2 c of minced parsley, the
  garlic, chopped carrots and bay leaves, poultry seasoning and *2*
  quarts of water. Then, with a spoon, evenly distribute the seasoning
  mixture around the chicken, turn the crock pot to high, and cook for
  at least six hours (or better still, OVERNIGHT). Remember, the longer
  you cook, the richer the base stock and the more tender the chicken.
  
       While the chicken is slow-cooking, it's a good time to prepare
  your noodles.  Go ahead and boil them according to package
  directions... but DO NOT COOK THEM UNTIL DONE! Keep in mind that
  you're going to drop them into a soup, so you want them el dente
  (firm), otherwise they'll turn to pure mush by the time you eat them.
  Furthermore, you want a small percent of the starch in the noodles to
  cook into the soup to thicken it slightly -if you cook the noodles
  all the way, the soup's consistency will be flat and thin.
  
       After the noodles are cooked, butter them slightly and set them
  aside.
  
       When the chicken is tender, take a set of tongs or a strainer
  spoon, remove it from the crock pot (it may tend to fall apart, but
  that's okay), and set it on a platter to cool. At this point, strain
  out all the seasoning vegetables from the stock, place the stock into
  a metal bowl, and place the bowl into the refrigerator or freezer
  until the chicken fat congeals (which should take about 1 hour).
  Meanwhile, pick the chicken off the bones and, with a sharp knife,
  chop it into bit-sized pieces.
  
       Then, in a heavy 12-inch skillet, melt the butter and saute the
  sliced onions, mushrooms,  and carrots until they're tender. Then
  drop in the chopped chicken meat. And over medium-low heat, cook it
  into the vegetables for about 10 minutes.
  
       While the chicken and vegetables are sauteing, remove the chicken
  stock from the refrigerator, skim off all the fat, and place the
  skimmed stock into a soup pot, along with the remaining 2 quarts of
  water. At this point, you should season the soup stock to taste with
  salt and pepper.
  
       Now drop in the sauteed chicken, mushrooms, onion rings and diced
  carrots - along with the sherry, the Tabasco*, and as soon as it
  comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer the soup for about
  30 minutes to allow all the flavors to thoroughly blend.
  
       When you're ready to eat, ladle out heaping helpings of the
  piping hot soup into bowls, garnish with a sprinkling of thinly
  sliced green onions, and serve with crunch saltines.
  
  *I just put a couple of drops of Tabasco in there -- Michelle, how
  much are we supposed to put in there?

    1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms; sliced

  IN A HOT NO STICK pan; saute the garlic until it becomes light brown.
  In the meantime, dust chicken cutlets w/flour and saute in oil until
  golden brown on both sides, (in garlic flavored oil). Do it quickly
  and lightly. Remove from skillet and set aside.
  
  ADD the mushrooms and saute until wilted. Pour the 1/2 cup dry
  Marsala wine into the pan and scrape up the brown bits that are on
  the bottom. Add 1/2 cup chicken stock (your own or a good quality
  store bought brand) and stir very well, reducing the liquid in the
  pan just a little. Return veal or chicken to the pan and simmer
  (BARELY) for about 15 minutes. Serve over rice or noodles.
  
  NOTE:  I have always used fresh mushrooms; tonight I found that my
  fresh ones were not so fresh so I used two 3oz cans of sliced
  mushrooms. We could hardly believe our tastebuds; as good or better.
  You can also hold this in a warm oven.  It will wait for you.
  
  Remember you can do this with veal as well.  I think it is the easiest
  fanciest dish I have.

      3 oz Package cream cheese
           -softened
      1 tb Chopped chives
      2 tb Milk
    1/2 c  Crushed, seasoned crouton
           -crumbs
      2 pk Refrigerated crescent rolls
    1/4 c  Melted margarine
 
  Mix chicken, cream cheese, chives, milk and salt in a medium bowl

  quart freezer bag. Put crouton crumbs in another 1 quart bag, attach
  it to bag of chicken filling, and freeze them.  Refrigerate crescent
  rolls.
  
  To prepare for serving, thaw chicken mixture.  Unroll crescent rolls.
  Each tube will contain 4 rectanngles of dough with a diagonal
  perforation. Press dough along each perforation so the rectangle
  halves will not separate. Place about 1/4 cup of chicken mixture into
  the center of each rectangle. Fold dough over the filling, and pinch
  the edges to seal tightly. Dip each packet in melted margarine, and
  coat with crouton crumbs. Place packets on a baking sheet.  Bake in a
  preheated 350 oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Pakcets are
  good either hot or cold. Makes 8 packets.

  Recipe by: Marcel Kerval of Cafe de France, St. Louis, MO Preparation
  Time: 0:40 NOTE: This recipe calls for Marcel Kerval's dill sauce.
  Please see the recipe for "Dill Sauce for Chicken Picardy" to
  complete these directions.
  
  TO PREPARE CHICKEN PICARDY: Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare
  eight squares of aluminum foil by cutting foil into sheets (6" x 6")
  and buttering them lightly on the shiny side.
  
  Bone and skin chicken breasts. DO NOT HALVE. Flatten breasts between
  sheets of waxed paper with knife edge and place each breast on a
  square of foil.
  
  Soak leeks. Separate and rinse well under running water to remove
  sand. Finely slice green portion, allotting 1/2 green portion of a
  leek to each breast. Chop mushrooms, spinach leaves, and shallots,
  allowing
        2    mushrooms per portion.
  
  Saute this mixture very briefly (about 30 seconds) in a little butter
  over medium heat. Place 1/4 of mixture on each breast. Splash about 1
  ounce white wine over each breast, salt and pepper to taste, and roll
  up each breast.
  
  Seal each breast in an aluminum foil square. Fold ends tightly to
  seal. Place prepared chicken into a baking pan filled with 2 or 3
  inches of chicken stock and bake in a pre-heated oven for 25 minutes.
  
  Saute cup of sliced leeks in butter over medium heat.
  
  TO SERVE: Unwrap chicken breasts and slice into 1/4-inch rounds. Pour
  a portion of Dill Sauce on a plate. Lay chicken rounds over sauce and
  garnish with sauteed leek slices and serve.

  I love Puerto Rican Food!... It's usually simple, yet rich with lots
  of cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can
  be simplified to taste. I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and
  garlic with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).
  
  I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it
  interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).
  
  PASTRY:
  
  Sift together flour and salt
  
  Add shortening and cut into flour with a dough blender or two knives
  
  Add milk and stir just enough to mix ingredients into a dough.
  
  Place dough on a lightly-floured board and divide in half.
  
  Set aside one half and roll out other half, with a lightly floured
  rolling pin into a circle large nough to cover a 9-10 inch pie plate.
  Do not stretch dough. Prick bottom and sides with a fork.
  
  Prepare other half in the same way and set aside for top covering.
  
  FILLING:
  
  In a skillet, brown rapidly salt pork and cured ham in oil. Reduce
  heat to low and saute onion, peppers, garlic and oregano until tender.
  
  Wash chicken pieces, add with salt and water.  Mix over moderate heat
  about
        3    minutes.
  
  Add pimientos, prunes, raisins, tomato sauce, olives, and capers and
  bring rapidly to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 30
  minutes.
  
  Add ingredients included in D, mix and remove from heat.
  
  Remove chicken pieces.  Separate meat from bones and discard bones.
  Mince the meat and add to skillet.
  
  Spoon fillling into pie plate.
  
  Cover top with other half of dough, being careful not to stretch it.
  
  Prick in several places with a fork.  Fasten edges of dough by
  pressing together firmly with a fork dipped in milk. Brush top
  lightly with milk.
  
  Bake in preheated ove (350 degrees F) about 45 minutes or until golden
  brown.

  the butter and shortening and blend the mixture until it resembles
  meal. Add the cheese and toss. Break egg into a measuring cup and add
  buttermilk to it so that the total volume is 1/2 cup. Beat with a
  fork. Add to the flour mixture, stirring until the mixture just forms
  dough. Gather dough into a ball and, on a floured surface, pat it out
  1/2-inch thick. Cut as many rounds as possible using a 2-inch fluted
  biscuit cutter, dipped in flour. Gather the scraps and pat and cut
  again. Arrange the rounds on the chicken mixture. Beat the egg yolk
  with the milk and brush the tops of the biscuits with the wash. Prick
  biscuits with a fork. Bake in the middle of a preheated 450f oven for
  15-25 minutes, or until biscuits are puffed and golden, and the
  filling is bubbling.

      Title: CHICKEN PIE WITH SWEET POTATO CRUST
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Chicken
    1/3 tb Dried tarragon or:
      1 tb Fresh tarragon
      1 pn Salt
    200 g  Diced carrots
      2 lg Leeks, diced
    200 g  Peas
     50 g  Butter or margarine
      3 tb Flour
    250 ml Chicken stock
    200 ml Milk
    250 g  White-fleshed sweet potato
    125 g  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking powder
    125 g  Softened butter
 
  This is comfort food. If you've lots of time, follow the recipe as
  given; the sauce will be rich and the chicken will be tender and
  moist. But if time is short, use a ready-cooked chick- en and
  tetra-pack chicken stock and steam or boil the vegetables. It is
  important to use white-fleshed sweet potato to make what is
  essentially a scone topping.
  
  Put a No 10-13 chicken in a large saucepan. cover with water, add a
  third of a tablespoon of dried tarragon (or a table- spoon of fresh),
  a pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Reduce heat immediately to a
  gentle simmer, skim off foam and poach gently until the chicken is
  just cooked. about 1 hour.
  
  Twenty minutes before the end of cooking time add 200 g diced carrots
  and 5 minutes later 2 large leeks, sliced, and 200 g peas. When
  chicken is cooked, drain off stock into another saucepan and boil
  hard to reduce for 10 minutes. Cool stock fast by sitting the
  saucepan in a sinkful of cold water, then transfer to the freezer to
  set the fat so it can be skimmed off
  
  Skin the chicken, remove the meat from the bones and chop. Put the
  chicken and vegetables in a souffle or oven dish. Melt 50 g butter or
  margarine in a saucepan and add 3 tablespoons plain flour to make a
  roux. Add 250 ml chicken stock and 200 ml milk and cook gently,
  stirring, until the sauce thickens. Add more stock if too thick. Pour
  over the chicken mixture.
  
  Meanwhile cook and mash 250 g white-fleshed sweet potato and allow to
  cool. Sift together 125 g plain flour, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon
  baking powder. Rub in 125 g softened butter. Add a little water if
  necessary to make a soft dough. (Or process the ingredients in a food
  processor, adding the water if necessary.)
  
  Tip onto a floured surface and with floury hands pat it out to fit
  inside the top of the dish containing the chicken and vegetables.
  Place on top of the chicken mixture. Bake in a 180 C oven for about
  45 minutes or until the top is golden.

           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1    Cinnamon stick (optional)
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
  1 1/2 c  Raw long-grain white rice
 
  *Note: To make Lamb Pilaf Atzem, substitute 2 lbs. lean lamb chunks
  for the chicken.
  
  Wash, dry and cut the chicken into serving pieces.  In an attractive
  cooking-serving casserole, heat the butter, and saute the chicken and
  the onion, turning the chicken pieces constantly. Sprinkle with salt
  and pepper, then add cinnamon stick, tomato sauce, and enough water
  to almost cover the meat.  Cover and simmer on top of the stove or
  bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 40 minutes. Pour out the liquid,
  measure, and if necessary add enough water to make 3 cups. Pour back
  into the casserole, add the rice and shake the pan a few times to mix
  the rice in. Continue cooking, uncovered, for 20 minutes longer, or
  until all the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. Remove from the
  heat and drape with a dry towel for 5 minutes. Serve hot.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Recipe Basic pizza dough
    1/2 lb Boneless skinless chicken
           Breasts
           Juice of one lemon
      2 ts Dried oregano
           Yellow cornmeal for pizza
           Pan
    1/2 c  Bottled barbeque sauce
      2 oz Cheddar cheese
      1 oz Mozzarella cheese, part skim
           Milk -- shredded
      1 oz Provolone cheese
     10    Scallion -- chopped
 
  Combine chicken lemon juice and oregano in small bowl Let stand at
  room temp. for 30 minutes.  Preheat broiler. Broil chicken 2 inches
  from heat for about 3 minutes on each side, or until no longer pink
  in center. Remove chicken from oven. Variation:  I used Sam's already
  cooked mesquite Chicken breasts 1 1/2 breast cut in cubes, and
  sprinkled oregano over the pizza. I elimintated the lemon. Lower oven
  temp. to 500 degrees. Cut chicken into small pieces. Form dough and
  place on pizza peel. Brush barbeque sauce over crust. Bake on stone
  for 3-5 minutes. Do not allow bar-b-que sauce to burn. You can put a
  fourth of the bar-b-que sauce on and then add the other 1/4 prior to
  putting on chicken and cheese; if you like a saucy taste Combine
  Cheeses in small bowl.  Scatter chicken over prebaked crust. Scatter
  scallions, then add cheese. I eliminated scallions. I used 1/2
  mesquite bar-b-que sauce and 1/2 of KC masterpiece honey terryiaki.

      Title: CHICKEN POACHED WITH STAR ANISE
 Categories: Chicken, Low-fat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 c  Water
  1 1/4 c  Soy sauce
  1 1/4 c  Chinese rice wine
           -or dry sherry
      1 c  Honey
      2 ts Salt
      4    Star anise
      1    Cinnamon stick
      2    Strips orange zest
      1    Chicken (3 1/2 to 4 lb)
           -skinned and trussed
           -if desired
      5    Scallions
           -whites left whole
           -greens finely chopped
           -for garnish
    1/4 c  Chopped cilantro
           -for garnish
      2 ts Sesame oil (opt)
 
  Combine all the ingredients except the chicken, sesame oil, and
  garnishes in a deep pot just large enough to hold the chicken. Bring
  to a boil. Add the chicken and simmer for 40-50 minutes, or until
  cooked, turning the bird form time to time to make sure it poaches
  evenly. Skim the mixture often with a shallow ladle to remove any fat
  that rises to the surface. The chicken is done when the juices run
  clear when a skewer is inserted into the thick part of the thigh.
  
  Drain the chicken, reserve the broth. Remove the trussing string;
  carve the chicken and cut it into pieces. Sprinkle with scallion
  greens and cilantro. Serve hot, at room temperature, or chilled.
  
  To serve, place chicken in shallow soup bowls with broth ladled over
  it. Sprinkle with chopped scallions and cilantro. Or brush the
  chicken pieces with sesame oil and brown them on the grill or under
  the broiler, then sprinkle with chopped scallions and cilantro.,
  
  Note: The broth can and should be reused. Strain it and let it cool
  to room temperature. Chill overnight in the refrigerator and skim off
  any fat that collects on the surface. Freeze into you're ready to use
  it again. To reuse, bring the broth to a boil, adding seasoning and
  water as necessary. The flavor improves each time you use it.

 Categories: Chicken, Pies
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      8 tb Butter, sweet
    1/2 ts Nutmeg, grated
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
      5 tb Flour
      3 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Pepper, black
    1/2 c  Prunes, pitted; coarsley
           -chopped
    1/2 c  Currants
    1/2 lb Mushrooms, quartered
      1    Pepper, Red bell;
           -cored/seeded/coarsely
           -chopped
      1 lb Pearl onions, frozen; thawed
      6 c  Chicken, cooked; cubed
      1 pk Peas, frozen; thawed
    1/2    Flaky pastry recipe
           Egg wash
 
  In a 2 quart saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons butter over low heat. Add
  the nutmeg and cinnamon and cook for 1 minute. Sprinkle the flour
  over the butter, and with a wooden spoon, stir to blend. Increase the
  heat to moderate and slowly add the chicken stock, blending well
  after each addition so that there are no lumps. Mix in the cream,
  salt and pepper. Gradually bring the mixture to a boil, stirring
  constantly. When it has thickened, add the prunes and currants. Cook
  over low heat 10 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in a saut^B pan
  over moderately low heat. When it foams, add the mushrooms and
  peppers. Saut^B until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, increase
  the heat to moderate, and saut^B for 15 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place the chicken in a large mixing
  bowl. Scrape the sauteed vegetables and peas on top, then pour the
  prune sauce over all. Toss gently to distribute all the ingredients.
  Taste for seasonings and adjust if needed.
  
  Spoon the chicken mixture into a deep 4-5 quart ovenproof casserole.
  Roll out the flaky pastry or puff pastry and, using the casserole's
  lid as a guide, with the tip of a sharp knife cut it to fit. Lay the
  pastry over the chicken mixture and brush it with the egg wash.
  
  Bake for 60-70 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Serve
  immediately. Serves 10-12
  
  Early cookbooks reveal that chicken pie was every bit as popular as
  roasted turkey for the prinicipal entree at Thanksgiving dinner. Al-
  though it's hard to believe, some familes even served both. This
  recipe, with its bizarre inclusion of prunes and currants, nutmeg and
  cinnamon, has been developed from a very early recipe. Do not be put
  off by the fruit and spices. Their presence is unobtrusive and they
  enhance what can be a very pedestrian sauce, turning it into a
  magnificent, if mysterious, backdrop for the chicken.

MMMMM----------------------MASHED POTATOES---------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Baking potatoes
    1/4 c  Low-fat sour cream
      2 tb (to 3 tbs) chives, minced
 
  Make Filling: In a 5-quart saucepan, bring 3 quarts water to a boil.
  Add chicken and simmer, uncovered, 20 min. Remove pan from heat and
  let stand 30 min. Transfer chicken to a bowl, discarding cooking
  liquid, and cool. Discard skin and bones. Cut chicken into 3/4-inch
  cubes and return to bowl.
  
  In a 3-quart saucepan bring 2 quarts water to a boil and cook onions
  until tender, 7-8 min. Transfer onions with a slotted spoon to a bowl
  of ice and cold water, reserving cooking liquid in pan. Cut root ends
  off onions and peel. Add onions to chicken.
  
  Return reserved cooking liquid to a boil and cook carrots and celery
  until just tender, 4-5 min. Drain carrots and celery and add with
  peas to chicken mixture.
  
  In pan cook mushrooms in  1/2 tsp butter over moderate heat, stirring,

  Make Mashed Potatoes: Peel potatoes and cut in to 1-inch pieces. In a
  saucepan cover potatoes with water by 1-inch and simmer until very
  tender, 10-15 min. Reserve about 1/3 cup cooking liquid and drain
  potatoes. In batches force potatoes through a ricer or food mill
  fitted with medium disk into a bowl and stir in sour cream, chives,
  salt and pepper to taste, and enough reserved cooking liquid to get a
  fluffy consistency. Transfer potatoes to a pastry bag fitted with a
  1/2-inch fluted tip.
  
  Spread filling in a 1 1/2-2-quart gratin dish or other shallow baking
  dish. Pipe mashed potatoes decoratively in mounds on filling and bake
  in middle of oven until filling is bubbling and potatoes are golden
  on edges, about 25 min.

      1    Onion, chopped (Or 1 cup

    1/2 ts Minced fresh sage
    1/2 ts Minced thyme leaves
      2 ts Minced fresh garlic
      2 tb Minced sweet green pepper
      2 tb Flour
  1 1/2    To 1 3/4 cups strongly
           -flavored chicken stock,
           -heated
      2 c  Cooked chicken cut into
           -3/4-inch chunks
      1 tb Chopped sweet marjoram
      1 c  Yellow turnip, peeled and
           -cut into 1/2-inch
           Pieces
      2 c  Waxy potatoes, peeled and
           -cut into 1/2-inch
           Pieces
      2 c  Carrots, peeled and cut into
           -1/2-inch pieces
           Salt
           Cayenne pepper
           Melt the butter in a heavy
           -saucepan and add the onion,
           -sage and thyme
 
  Cook, stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes.  Stir in the garlic
  and green pepper; cook for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from the
  heat and stir in the flour. Cook for a minute or two to remove the
  floury taste, then pour in the chicken stock, stirring constantly.
  The stock should thicken slightly.  Add the chicken and sweet
  marjoram and set aside. Meanwhile, cook the turnip and potatoes in
  boiling water for 5 minutes. Add the carrots and cook for 3 minutes
  more. Remove the pan from the heat and let the vegetables sit in the
  water while you make the biscuits or roll out the pie crust. BISCUIT
  TOPPING: 2 cups flour 2 1/2 tsp baking powder 5 Tbl shortening 3/4
  cup milk Stir together the flour and baking powder. Cut in the
  shortening with a pastry blender until it is the size of small peas.
  Stir in the milk with a fork. Pat the dough together. If you overmix
  it, the dough will be tough. Pat the dough to a 1-inch thickness. Cut
  the biscuits with a biscuit cutter or a straight-sided glass dipped
  in flour. TO ASSEMBLE THE PIE: Drain the vegetables and add them to
  the chicken mixture.  Taste the mixture and season with salt and a
  generous pinch of cayenne pepper. Pour the filling into a deep pie
  plate. Top with the biscuits (OR the crust; see the Variation). Place
  on a cookie sheet (in case the sauce drips) and bake in a preheated
  400 F oven for 15 minutes or until the biscuits are browned.
  VARIATION: PARSLEY CRUST "The amount of liquid depends upon the
  amount of moisture in the air. One trick in making pie crust is to
  add just enough liquid so that the dough barely holds togather. Then
  let it sit in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. The flour particles
  will swell and absorb the liquid and you will have a more tender
  crust." 1 cup flour 4 Tbl shortening 2 to 3 Tbl water, milk, or
  chicken stock Place the flour in a bowl. Cut in the shortening with a
  pastry blender. Little by little, add the liquid, tossing the mixture
  with a fork. Add the parsley, press together and place in the
  refrigerator for 20 minutes. Roll out on a floured surface. Place
  over the pie, cut air vents, and crimp the edges. Bake in a preheated
  425 F oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Let the pie set for a minute before
  serving VARIATION: Replace the potatoes with 2 cups of raw zucchini,
  cut into 1 inch pieces. Add the chicken stock along with the chicken.

      2    To 3 lb. roasting chicken
      1    Whole lemon
           Fresh ground pepper
 
  Wash & pat dry the basil, reserving large whole leaves for the
  roasting pan and for the chicken cavity.
  
  Mince remaining basil.  In a small bowl, with a wooden mallet or
  spoon (or using a mortar and pestle), blend minced basil, garlic and
  butter. Chill until slightly firm (this can be prepared ahead of time
  and refrigerated or frozen).  Have chicken at room temperature. Rinse
  thoroughly and pat dry with paper towel.
  
  With fingers, gently separate skin from meat, beginning at neck and
  continuing down over breast. Separate skin through to the meaty
  portion of the drumsticks. Place small bits of chilled basil butter
  between breast and leg meat and skin, being careful not to tear skin.
  
  Halve lemon, placing one piece in cavity of bird, along with 3 or 4
  whole basil leaves.  Truss chicken with string to secure wings and
  legs.
  
  Place remaining basil on bottom of roasting pan; set chicken,
  breast-side up, over top.  Drizzle with juice of remaining half lemon
  and sprinkle with pepper to taste.
  
  Roast in a preheated 375 F. oven for 25 minutes. Reduce heat to 350
  degrees and roast another 30 to 35 minutes or until drumsticks move
  easily in their sockets.  During this cooking period, baste
  frequently with pan juices. Let chicken stand 10 minutes before
  carving. Serve with defatted pan juices.

  chop and use them for chicken salad, sprinkled with toasted almonds
  or pine nuts."

  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken salad with Chinese seasonings -- This is a delicious salad
  my mother has been making for years. She found the recipe in the
  cookbook that came with her wok. If you leave out the fried bean
  threads, this is a reasonably low-calorie dish.  And if you use all
  vegetable oils, there's almost no cholesterol in it (except for
  what's in the chicken). Yield: serves 3-4.
  
  *  You can add garlic and ginger to the salad dressing that goes on
  the salad.
  
  *  This is also good hot, heat it just enough to get it hot and serve
  immediately.

      8 oz Fresh bean sprouts
      2 md Cucumbers
      1    Carrots (or double amount)

MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
      3 tb Sesame paste, or peanut
           - butter
      2 tb Finely chopped scallions
      2 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Chinese white rice vinegar
           -or cider vinegar
      3 tb Light soy sauce
  1 1/2 tb Finely chopped garlic
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
      1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
 
  TRIM THE BEAN SPROUTS at both ends. Peel the cucumber, split it in
  half lengthwise and remove the seeds with a teaspoon. Finely shred
  the cucumber into 3-inch lengths. Peel and finely shred the carrots
  into 3-inch lengths. Set the vegetables aside. Take all the meat off
  the cooked chicken and shred it into fine strips using a sharp knife
  or cleaver. Arrange the chicken strips on a platter and surround them
  with the bean sprouts, cucumbers and carrots. Combine all the
  ingredients for the dressing and mix them thoroughly. (I find an
  electric blender is useful for this, but you could use a screw-top
  jar and shake everything in it well.) Pour the dressing all over the
  chicken and vegetables and mix well. Serve at once.

  cut in bite size chunks, mango, papaya, pineapple - cut into bite
  sized chunks--as desired. Salt and freshly ground black pepper to
  taste Combine all the dressing ingredients, taste and adjust the
  seasoning. Sometimes I crush some fresh pineapple into the dressing.
  It makes for a nice addition.
   Depending on how much meat you have on the chicken, you may need
  more or less of the dressing.  Use your judgement. Mix the chicken
  with the fruit and nuts and toss with the dressing. I serve this on a
  huge platter lined with---> red cabbage and green savoy cabbage
  leaves--it is gorgeous!

  3.  To make the pancakes, beat the eggs, Nuoc Mam sauce, and pepper
  together with 1/2 teaspoon water in a bowl. Brush the bottom of a
  non-stick omelet pan with some oil and place over moderate heat until
  hot. Pour in half the egg mixture and tilt the pan immediately to
  spread the mixture evenly over the bottom - the pancake should be
  paper-thin. Cook until the egg is set - this should not take more
  than 30 seconds. Turn and cook on the other side for about 15
  seconds. Set aside. Repeat, using up the rest of the mixture and set
  aside. 4. Combine the garlic, chili, sugar, lime juice, vinegar, and
  Nuoc Mam sauce in a bowl. Stir to blend thoroughly. Set the dressing
  aside. 5. Drain the dried shrimp and pound or blend in a blender or
  processor until very fine. Set aside. 6. Cover the pork with water
  and bring to a boil over a high heat. Lower and boil for about 30
  minutes or until the juices run clear when the meat is pierced with a
  knife.  Run cold water over the pork and set aside. 7. Cook the raw
  shrimp in boiling water until just pink - about 2 minutes. Run cold
  water over them, drain, peel, de vein, and cut lengthwise in halves.
  Shred the shrimp and set aside. 8. Sprinkle salt over the cucumber
  and carrot, and leave to stand for 15 minutes. Run cold water over
  them and squeeze dry with your hands.  It is imperative that the
  vegetables are bone dry to ensure their crunchiness. 9. Dip the
  beansprouts in salted boiling water for 30 seconds. Run cold water
  over them and drain. 10. Cut the egg pancakes into strips. combine
  the egg pancake strips, dried shrimp, shredded shrimp, chicken,
  cucumber, carrot, beansprouts, mint, lemon grass, grapefruit, and
  sesame seeds.  Mix well with your hands and pout over the dressing
  mixture. 11. Transfer to as serving dish or serve separately, and
  sprinkle the ground peanuts over it. Garnish with cilantro. Serve
  with shrimp chips on which guests place bite-sized portions of the
  salad. Alternatively, serve in hollowed grapefruit shells instead of
  a serving dish.

      Title: CHICKEN SALTIMBOCCA
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Buttermilk
      2    Boneless chicken breasts
           - each split in half
      4 sl Ham
      8    Fresh sage leaves; -=OR=-
      1 ts -Dried Sage
    1/2 c  Flour
      2 c  Cooking oil
 
  COMBINE PEPPER AND BUTTERMILK in a bowl or glass pie dish large
  enough to hold the chicken in one layer and set aside. Place the
  flour on a plate and set aside. Place a slice of ham under the skin
  of the chicken and place 2 sage leaves or some dried sage inside.
  Place the breasts in the buttermilk and place in the refrigerator for
  20 minutes. Turn the breasts over and let sit another 20 minutes.
  Heat a 1-inch depth of oil in a heavy skillet to 375F. Oil is hot
  enough for frying when a droplet of water bubbles and dances across
  the surface. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator, remove from
  the marinade and wipe off excess buttermilk. Dust the breasts on both
  sides with flour and place in the hot oil. Cook about 6 minutes, turn
  and cook until a golden brown crust forms, about another 6 to 8
  minutes. Remove the breasts and drain on an absorbent towel. Serve
  immediately.

      4 lg Skinless, Boneless Chicken
           -Breast Halves (About
  1 1/2    Pounds)
    1/4 c  Soy Sauce

           Lemon Juice
    1/2 c  Creamy Peanut Butter
 
  ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS BEFORE SERVING:
  
  With a meat mallet or dull edge of a French knife, pound each of the
  chicken breast halves to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the chicken
  breasts, lengthwise, into 1-inch wide strips.
  
  In a large bowl, mix the chicken strips, soy sauce, salad oil,
  molasses, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic and 2 Tbls lemon juice.
  Cover and refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for at least 2
  hours, stirring occasionally.  Meanwhile, soak sixteen 6-inch long
  bamboo skewers in water to prevent charring when broiling.
  
  ABOUT 25 MINUTES BEFORE SERVING:
  
  Preheat the broiler if the manufacturer directs. Thread the chicken
  strips onto the bamboo skewers. Place the bamboo skewers on the rack
  in a broiling pan.  Brush generously with the marinade.  Place the
  pan in the broiler at the closest position to the source of heat.
  Broil 4 to 5 minutes until the chicken just loses its pink color and
  is tender, turning the skewers once and brushing the chicken with the
  remaining marinade frequently.
  
  While the chicken is broiling, in a small bowl, blend the peanut
  butter, 2 Tbls lemon juice, and 1/2 cup hot water using a fork and
  mixing until smooth.  Serve the chicken with this peanut sauce.

  The bacon drippings are for browning the chicken. The 20 lbs of
  chicken should be cut up in 2-inch-long pieces. Justin likes more
  wine in this sauce than some peoples. If you don't wish to use all 8
  Cups of Chablis in the sauce, feel free to drink what the sauce don't
  take. Make sure you taste your sauce as you add the wine. Me, I likes
  it. My wife, she don't. Make a roux.  (see the recipe for Justin
  Wilson's roux, also posted here). Add onions, bell pepper, green
  onions, and celery and saute until onions are tender and clear.  Add
  parsley and garlic and saute. Brown off chicken while roux is being
  made. After onions, etc. are tender, add water to bring roux to a
  smooth paste. Add all other ingredients and enough water to cover
  well.  Bring to a boil, and then cut heat. Cook for about 4 to 6
  hours. Serve over spaghetti. This is for a party and will serve 20 to
  40 people. You can freeze what you don't eat. From Justin Wilson's

      1    Egg
      2 tb Water
  1 1/2 c  Breadcrumbs
      5 tb Olive Oil
      2 tb Butter
 
  CHICKEN:
    Pound meat between sheets of waxed paper until thin. Combine flour,
  salt and pepper in pie plate.  Beat egg with water in shallow dish.
  Dredge meat in flour; dip in egg mixture; roll well in breadcrumbs.
  LET SIT ON WAX PAPER FOR 10 MINUTES!!!  Heat oil and butter in large
  skillet over medium-high heat.  Add meat in batches and saute until
  browned, turning once, about 3-5 minutes, adding more oil and butter
  if necessary. Keep warm and spoon mushroom sauce (see recipe).
  MUSHROOM SAUCE:
     Combine broth and flour in small bowl and stir until flour is
  dissolved. Melt butter in skillet over medium high heat. Add onion
  and saute until tender, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium; add
  mushrooms; saute 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in broth. Increase heat to
  medium high and cook until slightly thick, stirring occasionally,
  about 10 minutes. Blend in cream, salt and pepper. Season to taste
  with nutmeg and cayenne pepper. VARIATION: For thicker gravy, delete
  the whipping cream. Gravy will also be browner too.  (Or add Kitchen
  Bouquet to darken sauce.) NOTE: We find that if we are making this
  for company it is best to use TWO frying pans to speed things up.
  Also, this is wonderful when served with Fettucine Alfredo and
  Stuffed Tomatoes!

      Title: CHICKEN SHU-MEI
 Categories: Chinese, Dim sum, Appetizers, Chicken
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           === The Filling ===
      1 lb Ground chicken
      2 tb Light soy sauce
      2 tb Dry sherry
      1 ts Freshly grated ginger
    1/2 ts Ground white pepper
      1 tb Sesame oil
    1/2 ts Msg
      1 pn Sugar
      1 tb Chopped green onion
      1    Egg white
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 ts Salt
      4 tb Medium-chopped bamboo
           Shoots
           OR water chestnuts
      2    Garlic cloves -- crushed
           === The Wrapper ===
      1 pk Shu-mei skins or gyoza
           Skins
 
  * Note:  Available at most supermarkets.   Mix together all the
  ingredients for the filling;  mix them well. Place about 3/4
  tablespoon of the filling in the   center of each noodle wrapper and
  bring up the corners so that you have a little money bag. Leave the
  top open so you can see some of the meat. For fun you  might put 1
  frozen green pea  on the top of each for added color. Steam in an
  oiled bamboo steamer for 15 minutes on high heat.
    Note:  You can  also add a bit of shrimp to this dish. It adds a
  great deal of flavor.   Try about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh shrimp.
  Hint: Use lettuce circles for steaming small dumplings. Simply cut
  iceberg lettuce into  small  circles using a cookie cutter. Place a
  little circle under each dumpling o r shu-mei. No stick and lots of
  flavor. Comments: These are easy to make and probably the most
  popular dim sum I know. They resemble little money bags and are
  offered at the Chinese New Year because they help anticipate wealth.

 Categories: Butters, Harned 1994, Main dish, Moroccan, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken; quartered*
      2    Chicken livers
    3/4 c  Onion; minced
    1/4 ts Saffron threads; pulverized
           Turmeric; to mix w/saffron
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Parsley; roughly chopped
    1/4 c  ;Water
      2    To 3 tb. smen
      2 tb Fresh sweet butter
    1/2    Preserved lemon
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
 
  *See "Basic Method for Preparing Poultry" recipe.
  
  Place prepared chicken in 5 1/2 qt. casserole with the livers and
  minced onion.  Sprinkle with the spices and 1 tsp. salt. Toss to coat
  evenly.
  
  Puree parsley in blender or food processor with 1/4 c water. Add half
  the "parsley water" and all of the smen to the casserole. Pour in 1
  cup water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for one
  hour, adding more water if necessary.  Remove chicken to a colander
  when very tender and keep warm while the sauce simmers one full hour.
  
  Heat the 2 tb. sweet butter in a skillet; gently brown the drained
  chicken quarters.  Transfer to a flameproof serving dish, cover, and
  keep warm.
  
  Meanwhile, add the remaining "parsley water" to the sauce in the
  casserole and, by boiling rapidly, uncovered, reduce to 1 1/2 cups.
  Dump the sauce, livers, and odd bits of skin and bits in the blender.
  Whirl until the sauce is smooth.  Pour over the chicken and reheat.
  
  Discard the pulp from the preserved lemon and dice the peel. Sprinkle
  diced lemon peel over the chicken. Simmer 5 minutes, taste for
  seasoning, and add additional salt if necessary.  Sprinkle with lemon
  juice and serve at once.
  
  This is a classic dish from Fez.

      Title: CHICKEN SOPOPILLA (INCL. TORTILLAS)
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 tb Shortening -- (lard is
           Best)
    3/4 c  Warm water
           Oil for deep frying
           Cooked, cut up or shredded
           Chicken
           (Pork is to die for!)
           Salsa
 
  1. Mix the flour, salt and baking powder together. Cut in the
  shortening......Mix until it resembles cornmeal. 2. Stir in the water
  until all the dough is moist. 3. Turn onto a floured surface and
  knead about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap or towel and let rest
  for 30 minutes. 4. Cut the batch in half and roll out about 1/4"
  thick. (These are thicker than ordinary flour tortillas). 5. Cut into
  4 to 5" squares or rounds. ( I like round so use a coffee can to cut)
  6. Heat oil in a deep fryer or skillet to 400 degrees. (I just use a
  deep iron skillet with about 3" of oil.) and drop, *one at a time in
  the hot oil until puffed and golden brown (If they don't puff up, the
  oil's not hot enough) 7. Take out ofskillet and lay on paper towels.
  Continue until you have as many as you want. (*I own a huge black
  iron skillet so I can make 3 at one time) Let cool a little. 8. Take
  chicken or pork and mix with salsa. Heat chicken in salsa over stove
  before you stuff. (I change all the time but generally make a Ancho
  Chili Salsa) (E/mail for recipe.) 9. Carefully.......slit one side of
  the Sopapilla and put in about 3 tablespoons of the chicken.
  
  serve on a platter with each Sopapilla on a leaf of Romaine Lettuce
  and Salsa Fresca on the side to put over/or in them. This is a last
  minute, labor
  
  intensive procedure........but they are simply wonderful

      2 tb Chopped parsley
  1 1/2 lb Spaghetti broken

       Wash chicken pieces and place in large stockpot. COver with
     water and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken
     falls off the bones (approximately 2-3 hours). Remove chicken
     with slotted spoon and let cool. When cool enough to handle,
     remove bones and skin and cut all chicken up in small pieces,
     being careful not to leav any bones. Add chicken to stock left
     in pan and refrigerate overnight. When you remove pot from
     refrigerator, skim off the grease from the top of the stock (
     the chicken will be very moist from having remained in the
     stock overnight). Return pot to heat and slowly bring to boil.
     Add onions, celery, carrots, tomatoes, cabbage and potatoes.
     Add bouillon, bay leaf, salt and pepper, marjoram, basil, thyme
     and parsley and simmer until vegetables are done to your
     liking. Then add broken pieces of spaghetti and cook until
     tender. The soup will be very thick, almost stew-like. It
     freezes well.

      2    Chicken carcasses, plus
           -chicken feet if possible
    1/2 kg Chicken giblets

    200 g  Very fine noodles
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
 
  The following few posts are from "Mother Magyar", by Meryl Constance
  writing in the Sydney Morning Herald. The article is about Agi Adler,
  a Jewish lady who emigrated to Australia as a young woman shortly
  after WWII. Though she didn't know how to cook anything then, let
  alone Hungarian food, over the years she learned the art. The
  following recipes comprise an Hungarian feast and observe Jewish
  dietary laws. They look quite good and are remarkably simple.  So
  good that I typed them in by hand... There was a crease across them
  that drove my scanner bonkers.
  
  Maybe Mark can help us out with terms like "Becel margarine" and "No.
  15 chicken"...
  
  Put the marrow bone, chicken carcasses and giblets in a large pot
  with 2 litres of water.  Bring to the boil, skim and reduce to a slow
  simmer. Meanwhile, chop vegetables. After the soup has been simmering
  for half an hour, add the vegetables and parsley stems and continue
  cooking for about 2 hours.  Strain the broth, reserving the carrots
  and giblets. Add salt to taste.  Slice the carrots and giblets and
  return them to the soup.
  
  In a separate pot of boiling water, cook the noodles and then drain
  them. divide the noodles between 8 soup plates and ladle the soup
  over it. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     64 oz Chicken broth
           -(You can get away
           -with instant broth,
           -but make sure it is
           -of good quality.
           -I usually use Knorr
           -Chicken Bouillon cubes)
      4 tb White rice (unconverted,
           -not Uncle Ben's!!!)
      2 lg Eggs
      1    Lemon
    1/2 ts Salt (or more to taste)
 
  Bring the broth to a boil and add the rice and salt. Let rice cook for
  15-20 minutes. Remove pot from stove and let it cool for a while.
  
  Separate the whites from the egg yolks, and beat the whites in a large
  bowl, until they thicken a little. Add the yolks and the juice of the
  lemon and beat until you get a uniform mixture.
  
  Now carefully, using a ladle, pour some of the warm broth into the egg
  mixture, while beating continuously. When your bowl is full, pour the
  contents back into the remaining broth, and stir until you get a
  uniform mixture.
  
  Now serve and, I hope, enjoy!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greek style egg & lemon chicken soup -- Avgolemono in greek means
  egg and lemon and is the most popular technique for preparing soup in
  Greece. So much so, that unless stated otherwise, when one talks of
  soup, one means avgolemono soup. What follows is a recipe for my
  favourite, chicken soup, but feel free to substitute any kind of meat
  or fish broth for the chicken. Yield: Serves four -hungry- people.
  
  *  This process of treating eggs is known in greek as avgokomma, and
  describes both this process and what will happen if you are not very
  careful, the egg will coagulate and spoil everything! In order to
  avoid such an unfortunate occurrence, you must let the broth cool a
  little before adding the egg. This can easily be done by starting to
  beat the eggs only after you have removed the broth from the stove,
  thus giving time to the broth to cool.  However, if you're in a
  hurry, you can pour a small glass of cold water into the broth (which
  will obviously make the soup more diluted). The broth must be poured
  slowly into the egg and lemon mixture, but the two must be blended
  quickly (use of an electric mixer is recommended).
  
  *  The original recipe does not require beating the whites
  separately, so you can simply beat the eggs whole until the whites
  blend with the yolks, and then add the lemon. If you prepare the eggs
  this way, the soup will be a little less smooth.
  
  *  The soup can be kept in the refrigerator for a day or two. Be
  careful not to bring it to a boil when re-heating it, because the egg
  will coagulate.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (handling of egg whites in soup takes
  experience). : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHICKEN SOUP W/ APPLES & LEEKS
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Chicken, quartered
           Salt & Pepper, to taste
      2 tb Butter
      3    Leeks, w/ 1" green, sliced
      2    Granny Smith apples, peeled
      1 c  Apple juice
    1/2 c  Vinegar
      3 c  Chicken stock
      3 tb Calvados
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
 
  Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Melt the butter over medium
  heat in a saute pan just large enough to hold the chicken. Add the
  chicken, skin side down, and cook for about eight minutes over medium
  heat. If the butter in the pan starts to brown, lower the heat
  slightly. Turn the chicken and light saute in the same way for five
  minutes more.
  
  Remove the chicken from the pan and place it in a bowl. If the butter
  in the saute pan has burned, pour it out and replace it with two
  tablespoons fresh butter. Add the leeks and cook them for 10 minutes
  over medium heat. Stir the leeks every couple of minutes. They should
  be soft but not brown.
  
  Put the chicken back in the pan with the leeks.  Add the apples, apple
  juice, vinegar and broth.  Bring the liquids to a slow simmer and
  with a ladle skim off any fat or froth that floats to the top. Cover
  the pot and simmer the chicken very gently for 10 to 15 minutes,
  until it is completely cooked.
  
  Remove the chicken and let it cool.  Remove and discard the skin and
  pull the meat away from the bones. Cut the meat into half inch chunks.
  
  Use a ladle to skim off any fat that has formed on the surface of the
  liquid in a saute pan.  Add the Calvados and the heavy cream. Bring
  to a simmer and season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat the chunks
  of chicken in the soup for two minutes and serve immediately in hot
  bowls.
  
  Suggestions and variations:  Try adding a cup of sliced mushrooms
  along with the apples.  The mushroom flavor goes well with the other
  ingredients, and the mushrooms make the soup more substantial. This
  soup is also delicious with curry, which can be added by gently
  cooking a tablespoon of curry powder in a tablespoon of butter and
  stirring it into the soup shortly before serving.

      Title: CHICKEN SOUP WITH GALANGAL (KAI TOM KHA)
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Stalks lemon grass
      1 c  Water
      4 c  Coconut milk
      8    Chicken thighs or
  1 1/3 lb Chicken breast, diced
     10 sl Galangal
      2 tb Fish sauce
      3 sm Fresh chilies
      3    Bergamot leaves
      2 tb Lemon juice

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Spring onions, shredded
           Chilies, shredded
 
  This one's a bit more complex and gets into some exotic ingredients.
  All of them should be available from an Asian grocery. If you have
  any questions about what the ingredients are or how to use them, just
  ask. The only thing that can not be substituted for is the fish
  sauce. You could use ginger instead of galangal, but the soup would
  lack the perfumed, exotic aroma of the galangal that adds so much to
  the dish.
  
  Lime zest could be used for the bergamot leaves.
  
  Cut the lemon grass into 1-inch pieces.  Bring the water to the boil
  with half the coconut milk.  Then add the chicken, lemon grass,
  galangal and 1 tablespoon fish sauce.  Simmer for about 20 minutes or
  until the chicken is cooked.  Less cooking time will be required for
  diced chicken breast.
  
  Stir in the remaining coconut milk and turn up the heat. As soon as it
  begins to boil, toss in the whole chilies and bergamot leaves. Stir,
  and remove from the heat.
  
  Serve in individual bowls.  Sprinkle each with lemon juice and fish
  sauce to taste and garnish with slivers of spring onions and chili.

  Add anchovy and cook if it is used instead of patis. Bring to boil,
  then simmer until chicken is tender. While chicken is simmering, boil
  beans in water until they are easy to peel.  This is done by placing
  a bean between your fingers and rubbing the skin off the beans. When
  this is done with ease, remove from stove and drain. Add cold water
  to beans and then rub beans between your palms until almost all of
  the beans have been peeled. Keep replacing cold water and peeling
  will drain with water. When chicken is tender, add beans to soup and
  cook until soup is thick and beans are soft. Add water, if necessary,
  5 minutes before it is done++add the patis if anchovies are not
  available. Variation: Bitter melons, cut in squares or leafy
  vegetables such as spinach may be used. Pork may be used instead of
  chicken.

  cheese and nutmeg.  Make a well in the center and add eggs; mix until
  thoroughly combined.  The dough should be damp but firm. If
  necessary, incorporate additional breadcrumbs or a few drops of
  water; if the dough is too wet or too dry it will crumble.  To form
  the passatelli, pinch off a piece of dough and roll it about 1/4 inch
  thick, then break it into 1/2 inch lengths. Continue forming the rest
  of the dough in the same manner. Bring the broth back to a boil, add
  the passatelli and parsley and cook for 5 minutes. Ladle the soup

  overcook the chicken and make it stringy) When vegetables are to the
  desired tenderness add meat to soup and heat through. FOR EACH

  the rice and top with green onion, cilantro, cliles, tomatoes, and

  egg white mixture, letting excess drip back into bowl. Stir-fry until
  golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Lift out with slotted spoon to paper
  towels. Wipe out wok or skillet.
  
  Place wok over medium heat.  Whisk the reserved cornstarch/soy mixture
  again and pour into wok.  Bring mixture just to a boil. Add mushrooms
  and onions. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens, about 3
  minutes. Add the cooked chicken pieces and heat, stirring constantly,
  until chicken and vegetables are glistening and mixture is hot.
  
  Drain pasta and place on a large serving platter.  Top with the
  chicken/vegetable mixture.

      Yield: 4 Quarts
 
      5 lb Chicken, parts, (backs,

  all of the froth from the surface as it forms. Lower the heat and add
  all of the remaining ingredients except the peppercorns.  Simmer,
  uncovered, for 3 hours.  Add water as needed to cover the ingredients
  and skim when necessary. Add peppercorns for the last fifteen minutes
  of the simmering process. Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through
  a colander lined with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently
  press the solids to extract all of the liquid possible. Discard the
  solids and cool the liquid to room temperature. Refrigerate until
  chilled and lift off the solid fat that forms at the surface.
  Discard the fats.  Pour the stock into containers for storage, label
  and date.  Stock keeps for about 3 days in the refrigerator, and up
  to six months in the freezer.

      Title: CHICKEN STOCK OR BROTH BY JAMES BEARD~ CHEF
 Categories: Poultry, Vegetables, Soups
      Yield: 2 Quarts
 
      2 lb Chicken gizzards
      2 lb Chicken necks and backs
      1 md Onion; peeled; stuck with:
      3 ea Cloves (stuck in onion)
      1 ea Leek; well washed; trimmed
      1 ea Carrot; scraped
      2 ea Garlic cloves; peeled
      1 ea Bay leaf
      1 ea Parsley sprig
      1 ts Thyme; dried
      6 ea Peppercorns
      3 qt Water
      1 tb Salt
 
  Put the chicken pieces, vegetables, garlic, herbs, peppercorns, and
  water in a deep 8 quart pot or a stockpot. Bring to a boil. After 5
  minutes, skim off the scum that forms on the surface with a wire
  skimmer or a large spoon. Continue to boil rapidly for 15 minutes,
  skimming, then reduce the heat; cover the pot and simmer for 2 to
  2-1/2 hours. Season with salt to taste -- about 1 tablespoon. Strain
  the broth through a sieve lined with several thicknesses of
  cheesecloth into a large bowl and cool thoroughly in the
  refrigerator. Save the gizzards (they are good eating) and discard
  the other chicken parts and the vegetables. When the stock is cold,
  remove the layer of fat that has formed on the surface. You will have
  about 2-1/2 quarts of stock. It is a great aid and comfort to always
  have on hand good home-made beef, chicken or veal stock, but you have
  to be realistic. You must gauge your stock-making by the space you
  have to keep it in. Two or three days is about as long as you should
  keep stock in the refrigerator; if you keep it longer you should
  remove it and boil it up again before using. If you want to keep it
  for much longer periods of time, freeze it. You can safely keep stock
  frozen for up to three months. * Double Chicken Broth * Put the cold,
  fat-free, 2-1/2 quarts of previously make chicken stock into an 8
  quart pan. Add a whole stewing fowl or roasting chicken weighing 4 to
  5 pounds. Bring slowly to a boil. Again, skim off any scum that forms
  on the surface; reduce the heat; cover and simmer gently until the
  chicken is very tender, about 1 hour for a young chicken, or 2 to
  2-1/2 hours for a fowl. Remove the chicken and either serve it as
  poached chicken or remove the skin, take the meat from the bones and
  use it for chicken dishes ~- a chicken salad, hash, chicken pie, or
  creamed chicken. Strain the broth through several thicknesses of
  cheesecloth into a bowl; let cool, then skim off the fat. You now
  have two quarts of beautifully rich, strong broth to use for cooking.
  Should you want to reduce it even more and clarify it for consomme',
  ... see the recipe: Chicken Consomme' by James Beard. Note: Chicken
  consomme' must be absolutely fat-free and clear so it's very
  important that in the above directions you skim off all the scum that
  forms on the surface in the chicken stock broth and double chicken
  broth and strain it through several thicknesses of cheesecloth, and
  remove all the fat after the broth has cooled.

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Flour

      1 c  Milk
      2 c  Grated Cheddar Cheese
    1/4 ts Tobasco

  In Saucepan, melt butter, add flour.  Stir in broth and milk; cook
  until thickened, stirring frequently. Add remaining ingredients.
  
  Fill Stuff-a-roni.
  
  Cover bottom of 2 quart baking dish with 1 cup cheese sauce. Arrange
  filled stuff-a-roni in single layer in baking dish. Cover with
  remaining sauce.
  
  Cover dish with foil and bake at 375-degrees F., for one hour; or
  cover dish with waxed paper and microwave
       30    minutes turning once.
  
  Note: I usually make this dish after Thanksgiving.  I freeze left over
  turkey and gravy, and then later, when turkey seems like a treat
  again, I make the Stuff-a-roni. I do not use the wine; in it's place
  I use turkey gravy, and when it calls for broth, I also use a fair
  portion of turkey gravy.

  Blend smooth all ingredients except parsley.  Stir in parsley. Store
  in airtight container.
  
  Notes:
  
  Use this seasoning to make a quick chicken-like stock out of water
  when you have no veggie stock on hand. Excellent for flavoring rice
  and as a soup base.
  
  Make a very simple, easy, and good-tasting gravy by mixing water,
  seasoning, and miso (I like the dark brown rice miso). Typical
  proportions: 1.5 cups water, 1 T seasoning, 2 t miso.
  Increase/decrease seasonings according your your taste.  Right before
  serving gravy, mix some starch (I frequently use potato starch) in a
  bit of water till well-blended and add to gravy to thicken (do this
  over medium heat). Add starch until you reach desired thickness.
  Quick, easy, and surprisingly tastey. From _Country Kitchen

      Title: CHICKEN SURPRISE
 Categories: Kids, Poultry
      Yield: 3 -4 serving
 
  3 1/2 lb Chicken; fryer or broiler
    1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
      1 ea Lemon
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 ts Paprika
    1/2 lb Seedless Grapes
 
  1.  Read the entire recipe before doing any other steps. 2. Put on an
  apron. 3. Wash your hands. 4. Assemble ingredients and equipment. 5.
  Check the position of the oven shelf to be sure the Chicken Surprise
  will fit without touching the top of the oven. Chicken Surprise
  should be cooked about 4 inches from the bottom of the oven. Preheat
  the oven to 375 degrees.  It takes about 10 minutes for an oven to
  heat to the correct temperature. 6. Look inside the chicken. You will
  see a package that holds the gizzard, the neck, the liver and
  sometimes the heart. Take the package out, unwrap and put in a
  covered container in the refrigerator. 7. Wash the chicken under a
  heavy stream of cold water. Be sure to let water run through the
  inside of the chicken, too.  Pat the chicken dry and set aside. 8.
  Place a brown paper bag flat on your work surface. 9. Measure 1/4 cup
  of vegetable oil. 10. Dip your fingers in the oil and use the oil to
  finger-paint the bag. Finger-paint the front of the bag first. The
  color will change from light brown to dark brown. 11. Turn the bag
  over. Finger-paint the back of the bag. 12. Next, finger-paint each
  side panel. Stand the bag up in the oven-to-table baking dish. (Don't
  worry if you haven't used all the vegetable oil in finger-painting
  the bag--some bags need more oil than others.) 13. Wash your hands.
  14. Wash 1 lemon under a stream of cold water. Pat dry.
  
  Note:  Lemon juice on a small cut or scrape will sting. To stop the
  sting, wash the cut or scrape under cold water to rinse away the
  lemon juice.
  
  15.  Place the lemon on the cutting board and cut in half with the
  paring knife.
  
  KNIFE SAFETY RULE: Knives can be dangerous if not used with care. To
  prevent accidents, ONLY ONE PERSON SHOULD CUT AT A TIME. When someone
  is using a knife on the cutting board, everyone else should keep
  their hands away!
  
  16.  Rub the chicken all over with 1 lemon half--but do not squeeze
  the lemon.  Set the 2 lemon halves aside to use in step 21. 17.
  Spread a 12 inch piece of waxed paper on your work surface. Measure
  dry ingredients over waxed paper to make clean-up easier. 18. Measure
  over the waxed paper by mounding and leveling with the table knife
  and sprinkle all over the chicken:
      1/2    teaspoon salt
      1/4    teaspoon pepper 19. Fold the waxed paper together
  carefully so the extra dry ingredients do not scatter, and throw
  away. 20. Rub the salt and pepper all over the outside of the
  chicken--the bottom, too-- with your fingers. 21. Stuff the 2 lemon
  halves inside the chicken. Wash your hands. 22.  Hold the strainer
  over the chicken. Put about 1 teaspoon of paprika (no need to mound
  and level) into the strainer and dust gently all over the chicken.
  23. Put the chicken into the oiled bag with its back on the bottom.
  24. Wash 1/4 pound of seedless grapes by running cold water over
  them. Pat dry. 25. Pull the grapes from the stem and drop them into
  the bag over the chicken. Throw away the stem. 26. Fold the bag. 27.
  Clip the bag shut with 4 paper clips or tie loosely with string so
  the bag cannot flop open.  Push the top of the bag down so it will
  not touch the top of the oven.
  
  28.  Put the chicken in the 375 degree oven for 1 hour. 29. After
  about 30 minutes, listen at the oven door-- you will hear the juices
  crackling. You can smell the chicken cooking, too. 30. Put the trivet
  and scissors on the table. 31. After the chicken has cooked for 1
  hour, use potholders to remove the baking dish from the oven to the
  trivet. 32. Turn off the oven. 33.  Use a potholder to hold the top
  of the bag, and cut off the top half with the scissors.  DO NOT TOUCH
  THE PAPER CLIPS--THEY WILL BE HOT! Be careful ~- steam will rise when
  the bag is cut. 34. Carve and serve the Chicken Surprise from the
  bag.  Spoon grapes over each serving.

      Title: CHICKEN SZECHUAN-STYLE WITH SESAME PASTE
 Categories: Poultry, Appetizers, Chinese
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Whole chicken beasts,
           Skinned and boned
      2 tb Szechuan peppercorns
      4 tb Sesame paste
      3 tb Green tea

  2 1/2 ts Soy sauce
      3 tb Peanut oil
      2 ts Crushed red pepper *
      3    Slices fresh ginger, minced
      1    Scallion (white part only),
           Chopped
      1 cl Garlic, minced fine
  1 1/2 tb Dry sherry or
           Shaoshing wine
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
           Lettuce leaves
 
  *  or you substitute 2 whole chili peppers, crushed. In a pot, poach
  the chicken breasts in a little boiling water for 10 minutes until
  white and opaque. In a dry frying pan, toast the Szechuan peppercorns
  over moderate heat, then crust or grind them; set aside. Remove the
  chicken breasts from the pot, drain and cool them. Slice them, then
  shred the slices into julienne pieces. In a mixing bowl, combine the
  sesame paste and green tea (or the peanut butter and sesame oil --
  See NOTE). Add the vinegar and soy sauce; blend well. Add the peanut
  oil, red pepper, ginger, scallion, garlic, sherry, cayenne pepper,
  and the peppercorns. Mix all ingredients very well. Toss the chicken
  strips in this sauce, to coat. Refrigerate until 20 minutes before
  serving. Pass the chicken and the lettuce leaves separately, and let
  each guest place a small portion of the chicken in the middle of a
  lettuce leaf and roll it up like an egg roll to eat using fingers.
  Makes 6 appetizer servings.
  
  NOTE:  The authentic recipe calls for green tea to thin the sesame
  seed paste,
       but you may substitute chicken broth, or simply water, if you
  prefer.
       Another substitution you may make if you wish is peanut butter
  for the
       sesame seed paste along with sesame oil instead of green tea.
       This dish is served cold or at room temperature and can be made
  a day

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Chicken
      1 tb Olive oil
  1 3/4 lb Eggplant
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Onions, chopped

    1/2    Bell peppers, red
      3 md Tomatoes
    1/2 c  Raisins
      1 tb Parsley
 
  Cut chicken into serving pieces.  Remove backs and wings and save for
  soup. Remove all skin and fat from chicken. Heat oil in large frying
  pan; saute chicken in 2 batches until opaque on both sides (a few
  minutes). Set aside.
  
  Cut unpeeled eggplant into 1" cubes; salt for 20 minutes, then drain
  and rinse.  Heat oil in 6-8-qt Dutch oven. Add onion, garlic, and
  eggplant. Saute over low heat until onion is just tender, 5-10
  minutes.
  
  Add stock, cinnamon, curry powder, cumin, turmeric, and black pepper.
  Stir, bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Peel turnip; dice turnip, zucchini, carrot, and bell pepper. Add dark
  meat and diced vegetables to Dutch oven. Simmer, uncovered, 10
  minutes.
  
  Dice tomatoes.  Add chicken breasts, tomato, raisins, and parsley,
  pushing down lightly to be sure ingredients are covered by liquid.
  Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes more.
  
  Serve hot in deep soup bowls on top of rice, noodles, or couscous,
  garnishing top with coriander.
  
  Sylvia's notes: I used a whole chicken and dumped everything in the
  crockpot, which worked fine except that the vegetables weren't done
  (since it cooked about 6 hours instead of the usual 10 when I use the
  cp on a workday), so I boiled the vegetables in the stock until they
  were soft. However, I was not pleased with the result, and I think it
  was the combination of flavors (or lack thereof) rather than the
  cooking method. The chicken was fine, and the broth was delicious,
  but the vegetables were tasteless cardboard.

      Title: CHICKEN TANDOORI #1 OF 2
 Categories: Chicken, Barbecue, Indian, Low-cal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8    Chicken legs with thighs
           - attached
    1/3 c  Lemon juice
  2 1/2 ts Meat tenderizer
           - unseasoned; natural

MMMMM----------------FOR LOVELY VERMILLION COLOR---------------------
      1 tb Red food coloring
      2 tb Yellow food coloring

MMMMM------------------------FOR MARINADE-----------------------------
      1 c  Yogurt; plain
      2 lg Garlic cloves
      1 tb Ginger root; fresh; chopped
      1 ts Cumin seeds; roasted;ground*
    1/2 ts Cardamom; ground
    1/2 ts Red cayenne pepper
           Ghee or vegetable oil;
           - for basting
 
  *HOW TO ROAST CUMIN SEEDS: Take a small sauce pan or frying pan and
  heat it until moderately hot. Put in the cumin seeds and shake pan
  back and forth or stir until seeds turn from dark green to brown.
  This happens very quickly. Remove seeds immediately. When cool, grind
  to a powder. If this seems like a big hassle, just use powdered
  cumin. Flavor of dish will be only slightly different from original.
  
  **ABOUT GHEE: Ghee is clarified butter. I usually use a mixture of
  half margarine and salad oil.
  
  DIRECTIONS: 1. Remove skin from chicken legs. Prick the chicken all
  over with fork or thin skewer. Make diagonal slashes, 1/2- inch deep,
  1 inch apart on the meat. Mix food colors together, and using a
  pastry brush, paint chicken. Coloring will stain fingers, so be
  careful. Put the meat in a large bowl.
  
  2. Add meat tenderizer and lemon juice to the chicken, and rub them
  into the slashes and all over for 2 minutes. Cover and marinate for
  1/2 hour.
  
  3. Put all the ingredients of the marinade into the container of an
  electric blender or good processor, and blend until reduced to a
  smooth sauce. (Alternatively, garlic and ginger may be crushed to
  paste and blended with the remaining ingredients.)
  
  4. Pour this marinade over the chicken pieces and mix, turning and
  tossing, to coat all the pieces well. Cover and marinate for 4 hours
  at room temperature, or refrigerate overnight, turning several times.
  (I refrigerated chicken) Chicken should not remain in the marinade
  for more than 2 days, because the marinade contains a meat tenderizer
  which, with prolonged marinating, alters the texture of the chicken
  meat to very soft and doughy.

      Title: CHICKEN TANDOORI #2
 Categories: Indian, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Chicken pieces
      1 md Onion, minced
      3    Cloves garlic chopped
      1 ts Fresh chopped ginger
     10 oz Natural yoghurt
      1    Lemon rind & juice
      2 tb Vinegar
      1 ts Paprika
      2 ts Garam masala
      2 ts Ground coriander
      1 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Red food colouring
 
  Skin chicken pieces, score with sharp knife. In non-metallic bowl,mix
  all ingredients. Marinate chicken in mixture overnight, turning to
  marinate evenly. Cook on brazier bbq so that flames have direct
  contact with chicken (ie not on a hot-plate), or in a vertical grill
  on maximum heat. The object here is to emulate the tandoor as much as
  possible in cooking with intense, dry heat.
  
  Serve with rice, naan, lettuce, onion rings, cucumber slices and lemon
  wedges.
  
  I personally add ground mint and ground very hot chilli powder the
  above marinade. I probably don't want to know what the original red
  coloured powder is in the tandoori powder I buy from Indian spice
  merchants, but it adds to the authenticity. I now mainly use a powder
  tandoori marinate from Keens. It is cheap, easy and authentic. Have
  fun.

           - continued below
 
  5. Take the chicken from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before
  cooking to bring it to room temperature. The chicken is now ready to
  be either roasted in the oven or broiled over an electric or charcoal
  grill.
  
  TO ROAST IN THE OVEN: Start heating the oven to 500-550 degrees F.
  Take the chicken legs out of the marinade. Brush them with ghee or
  oil, and place them on a wire rack in a shallow roasting pan. Set the
  pan in the middle level of the oven, and roast for 25-30 minutes, or
  until the meat is cooked through. There is no need to baste while the
  chicken pieces are roasting, because the enclosed environment keeps
  the chickens from drying excessively. (I made the chicken this way,
  and it tasted just like the Indian restaurant's did.)
  
  TO BROIL INDOORS: Preheat the broiler. Brush the grill with a little
  oil to prevent the meat's sticking. Place the chicken legs, slashed
  side up, on the grill, and brush the slashed side with ghee or oil.
  Cook 2 to 3 inches away from the heat for 20 minutes. Turn and cook
  the other side for another 10 minutes, or until the chicken pieces
  are cooked through. Brush often with ghee or oil during cooking.
  
  TO GRILL OUTDOORS: Fire the coal well in advance (about 1-1/2 hours
  before you are ready to begin cooking), so that a white ash forms
  over the surface of the coal. This is when the coal is at its
  hottest. Place the grill at least 5 inches away from the heat, and
  rub generously with oil. Place the chicken pieces, slashed side up,
  over the grill and brush them with ghee or oil. Let chicken cook
  without turning for 10 minutes. Turn, baste the other side, and cook
  for 10 minutes. continue to cook, turning and basting the chicken
  every 10 minutes, until it is done. The cooking time for broiling and
  grilling usually varies widely. Much depends upon the intensity of
  the heat and its distance from the chicken. The point to remember is
  that the chicken pieces have been marinating in a very strong
  tenderizing solution for two days and therefore will cook much faster
  than standard broiled or barbecued chicken. Serve the chicken
  immediately, lightly brushed with ghee or oil and accompanied by
  Roasted Onions (Bhone Piaz).

    1/4 c  Low sodium soy sauce
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
      1 ts Oriental seesame oil
      1    Clove garlic, minced

      and chicken.  Marinate chicken at room temperature
        1    hour, or
      refrigerate if marinating longer.
  
  2.  Heat olive oil in non-stick wok or skillet. Transfer chicken from
      marinade to skillet and saute until barely cooked, about 2
  minutes.
      Add a little marinade if needed.
  
  3.  Add prepared vegetables and stir-fry until crisp tender.
  
  4.  Warm pita bread in microwave oven if desired.
  
  5.  Stuff pita bread with filling.
  
  NOTE: If you haven't tried low sodium soy sauce, it is time to go
  with it.
   Kikkoman makes it with a green label.  The taste is the same, but the
  sodium level is way down, so it's much better for you.

    1/2 ts Coarsely ground black
           -peppercorns
    1/2 ts Cumin seeds
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
      2    Bay leaves
           Salt
      6    Cloves garlic, halved
  1 1/2 tb Mixed-Spice Paste (recipe
           -follows)
      1 tb All-purpose white flour
      1 md Onion, thinly sliced
      4    Long banana peppers, cut
           -into long strips
      1 tb Vegetable or olive oil
      2 tb Cider vinegar or to taste
 
  Bring 7 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan, add chick- en (and a
  little more water to cover if needed). Skim off any grayish foam that
  rises during the first few minutes of simmering. Add black pepper,
  cumin, oregano, bay leaves, 1 tsp. salt and garlic. Partially cover
  and simmer gently for 20 to 25 minutes, until the juices run clear
  when the thighs are pierced with a knife (boned thighs will cook in
  15 to 20 minutes). Remove from the heat and cool the chicken in the
  cooking liquid, if time permits. With a slotted spoon, remove thighs
  from the broth and set them on a plate. Strain broth, skim fat and
  set aside
    2 1/2    cups in the refrigerator.
  
  Rub 1 Tbsp. Mixed Spice Paste over the side of the chicken that has
  been skinned and let it stand 1 hour uncovered in the refrigerator.
  Lightly dust the spice covered side of the chicken with flour,
  patting gently to evenly distribute it over the surface and remove
  any excess.
  
  Rinse onions, drain thoroughly and set aside with chilies. Set a large
  nonstick skillet over medium heat, add oil, and when it is hot, add
  chicken, spice-side down, and fry until crisp, about 4 to 5 minutes.
  Drain on paper towels and keep warm in a 200 degree F. oven.
  
  Return the pan to the heat and add onions and chilies. Cook over
  medium for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions
  soften. Add vinegar, reserved broth and remaining 1/2 Tbsp. spice
  paste, stirring to dissolve the paste. Simmer for several minutes to
  blend the flavors. Taste for salt and vinegar. Place 2 thighs in each
  of 4 bowls. Top with a portion of the onion mixture and the broth.

      Title: CHICKEN TORTELLINI IN A SWEET ONION-LAMBRUSCO
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
  :          Red Onion Marmalade:
        2 md red onions, -- chopped into
      1/4    -inch dice
        2 c  Lambrusco wine, or other
  :          light bodied fruity red
  :          wine
        1 c  orange juice
        2 TB sugar
  :          Filling:
        2 TB butter
        7 oz boneless, skinless breast of
  :          chicken
      1/2 c  dry white wine
        3 oz Prosciutto, -- cold from
  :          refrigerator
        5 oz Mortadella, -- cold from
  :          refrigerator
      3/4 c  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  :          plus 1/2 cup
      1/2 ts freshly grated nutmeg
      1/4 c  milk
        1    egg
  :          Pasta:
        1    recipe basic pasta
        2 c  basic chicken broth
  
  To make marmalade:
  
  Place chopped red onions, Lambrusco, orange juice and sugar in a
  saucepan and place over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, lower heat
  to medium and reduce until thick like marmalade, about 30 minutes.
  Remove from heat and allow to cool.
  
  To make filling:
  
  In a 12- to 14-inch saut_ pan, melt butter over medium heat until just
  starting to foam. Slice raw chicken very thinly across the grain and
  place in pan with butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly,
  until very lightly browned. Add wine, cover and cook for 5 minutes.
  Remove cover and cook until liquid is gone, 2 to 3 more minutes.
  Remove from heat and allow to cool. Cut prosciutto and mortadella
  into 1/4-inch dice and place in food processor. Add cooled contents
  of saut_ pan and pulse until just ground, like meat, not like a
  mousse. Pour into a large mixing bowl and add cheese, nutmeg, milk
  and egg, folding carefully. Check for seasoning with salt only and
  refrigerate.
  
  Fresh Egg Pasta: 4 extra large eggs 3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose
  flour plus 1/2 cup
      1/2    teaspoon olive oil
  
  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
  board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil
  and any other flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together the
  eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting
  with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing
  the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial
  phase looks messy. The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour
  is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
  hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
  the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
  board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
  elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
  remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
  plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Note:
  do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are
  essential for a light pasta.
  
  Yield: 1 pound
  
  To assemble tortellini:
  
  Lay out 1 sheet of pasta and cut into 2-inch rounds using a water
  glass or cookie cutter. Cover cut rounds with a damp kitchen towel so
  that they do not dry out. Working 5 at a time, place 1/2 teaspoon
  filling in center of each round. Fold each round in half to form a
  half moon and pinch the edges tightly together to seal. Take the two
  opposing corners and bring the tails of the half moon together,
  twisting one half turn so that the sealed half round edge curves
  around the outside of the filled soul of the tortellini. Repeat with
  each round until all pasta is used up. Leave formed pasta shapes
  uncovered to dry.
  
  To serve, heat the chicken stock to boil in a large pasta pot and add
  onion marmalade. Check broth for seasoning with salt. Drop 48
  tortellini into broth and return to boil. Lower heat until just under
  boil and cook tortellini until tender and yet still possessing a
  discernible resistance to the bite, about 4 to 6 minutes. Spoon 12
  tortellini into each of 4 warm soup bowls and divide the broth among
  them. Sprinkle with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve immediately.

      1/4 c  shallots -- finely chopped
  :          OR: green onion
        1 TB olive oil
        8 oz mushrooms -- trimmed and
  :          finely
  :          chopped (2 cups)
      1/2    red bell pepper -- cored,
  :          seeded and
  :          chopped
        2 TB all-purpose flour
    1 1/2 ts sweet paprika
      1/2 ts salt
      1/8 ts pepper
      1/3 c  lowfat plain yogurt
       10 oz chicken -- cooked, chopped
  :          (about 2 cups)
  
  1. Prepare Dough: Stir together flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in
  large bowl. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in butter and
  vegetable shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in
  yogurt, mixing just until mixture comes together. Divide dough in
  half, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours or
  overnight. 2. Prepare Filling: Saute' shallots in oil in large
  skillet over low heat, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add
  mushrooms and sweet red pepper; cover and cook 5 to 7 minutes over
  low heat or until mushrooms have given off their liquid and peppers
  are soft. Stir in flour, paprika, salt and pepper; cook 2 minutes.
  Stir in yogurt and chicken. Cool to room temperature. 3. Preheat oven
  (400 degrees). Grease 1 large or 2 small baking sheets. 4. Working
  with half the dough at a time, roll out one 12 x 12-inch square. Cut
  in half diagonally into 2 triangles, then in half again to form 4
  triangles. Place triangles on prepared baking sheet. Top each
  triangle with one-fourth of the filling, leaving a 1/2-inch border
  all around. Brush border with water. Roll out remaining dough to 12 x
  12-inch square. Cut into 4 triangles as with first piece. Place one
  triangle on top of each triangle on baking sheet. Seal edges with
  fingers. Prick tops of turnovers several times with fork. 5. Bake for
  25 minutes or until crisp and golden brown.
  
  Hints:: Dough can be made several days ahead, wrapped and
  refrigerated. The unbaked turnovers can be frozen, and then baked in
  a pre-heated 375 oven for 5 to 10 minutes longer than in Step 5.
  
  To speed up preparation, use a store-bought refrigerator crescent
  dough and form it into turnovers. For appetizer portions, make
  smaller turnovers. Also delicious using leftover cooked turkey, beef,
  or pork. Makes 4 main-dish turnovers. Recipe can be halved or
  doubled. Typos by Brenda Adams <adamsfmle@sprintmail.com> Source: The

           Cinnamon
           -(3 in stick)

           -peeled and
           -coarsely chopped
     10    Garlic cloves,
           -peeled and coarsely
           -chopped (or less)
      1 tb Coriander seeds, ground
    1/2 ts Turmeric, ground
      2 lb Chicken breast
           -(boneless), cut into
           -bite-sized pieces
      8 oz Tomato sauce
    1/2 lb New potatoes,
           -peeled and quartered
 
  Grind cumin seeds, black pepper, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, black
  mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds together in a spice grinder. In a
  small bowl, combine ground spices, vinegar, salt, cayenne pepper and
  brown sugar. Set aside.
  
  Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat.  Fry onions, stirring
  frequently, until they are a rich, dark brown. Remove onions with a
  slotted spoon and put them in a blender. Turn off the heat, but do
  not discard the oil.  Add about 3 T water (or more if necessary) to
  the onions and blend until you have a smooth paste. Add this onion
  paste to the spices in the bowl.  This mixture is the vindaloo paste.
  
  Put the ginger and garlic in a blender.  Add about 3 T water and blend
  until you have a smooth paste.
  
  Heat the remaining oil in the saucepan over medium heat. When hot,
  add the ginger, garlic paste.  Stir until the paste browns slightly.
  Add the coriander and turmeric. Stir a few seconds. Add the chicken,
  a little at a time, and brown lightly.
  
  Add the vindaloo paste, tomato sauce and potatoes to the chicken in
  the saucepan.  Stir and bring to a slight boil. Cover the saucepan,
  reduce heat to low and simmer for about an hour, or until potatoes
  are tender. Serve over rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spicy chicken curry -- Nearly every Indian restaurant serves
  something that it calls Chicken Vindaloo, but the dish varies greatly
  from place to place. This recipe is a modification of a vindaloo
  recipe that appears in Madhur Jaffrey's "Indian Cooking" (Barron's
  1983). I've attempted to approximate the Chicken Vindaloo served at
  The Tandoor Palace on Second Avenue in New York. Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  Don't undercook the onions.  They should be cooked until dark
  brown. If the onion paste turns out gray rather than brown, then the
  onions were not cooked enough.
  
  *  This dish is very, very hot.  It may not seem so at first, but the
  spices have a cumulative effect that builds up over the course of the
  meal.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 to 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

     10    Chicken wings (yield 20
           "Drumsticks)
      1    Egg white, slightly beaten
    1/3 c  Cornstarch--mixed with:
      1 ts Baking powder
           Peanut oil for deep frying

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      1 ts Five-spice powder
    1/2 ts MSG (optional)
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Rice wine
      1 ts Soy sauce
 
  Discard wing tips.  Cut between joints.  Remove the smaller bone of
  the lower wing.  Cut skin loose around the small end and push skin
  and meat up to form drumstick.
  
  Marinate wings for 1 hour.  Add egg white.  Coat wings evenly. (Using
  egg white to coat the wings will help to seal the juice inside the
  meat. Hence the meat will be juicier.
  
  Dredge wings in cornstarch mixture.  (Using cornstarch and baking
  powder helps to make the outside layer crisp.)
  
  Deep-fry for 3 minutes.  Drain.  Let cool.
  
  Deep-fry once again right before serving.  (Deep-fry the first time
  to cook the meat and seal the juice in the meat. The second time to
  make the outside crisp. Make sure the oil is very hot before you
  deep-fry for the second time.)

      Title: CHICKEN WITH BASIL SAUCE
 Categories: Poultry, Australian, Herbs
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lg Chicken fillets

MMMMM-----------------------CRUMB TOPPING----------------------------
      1 c  Bread crumbs, fresh
    1/3 c  Parmesan, grated
      1 tb Parsley, chopped
    1/4 lb Bacon
      3 oz Butter
      2    Garlic cloves
      2 ts Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 ts Mustard, dry

MMMMM------------------------BASIL SAUCE-----------------------------
    1/2 c  Oil
    1/4 c  White vinegar
      1    Garlic clove, crushed
    1/2 c  Cream
      1    Egg yolk
      1 c  Basil leaves (fresh),
           -finely chopped
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Combine bread crumbs, cheese and
  parsley. Saute chopped bacon and drain on absorbent paper. Add the
  bacon to the bread crumb mix. This is the crumb topping for the
  chicken.
  
  In a pan, melt the butter, then add the crushed garlic, Worcestershire
  sauce and mustard. Mix and heat through. Coat the chicken fillets
  with the butter mixture by dipping them in the saucepan. Arrange in a
  shallow, ovenproof dish. Press the bread crumb mixture on top of the
  chicken pieces to provide a crumb topping. Bake uncovered for 20 to
  25 minutes.
  
  While the chicken cooks, make the basil sauce:  in a saucepan combine
  all sauce ingredients except the egg yolk. Stir until heated and then
  add the egg yolk, stirring until thickened. Do not boil. Pour the hot
  sauce over the chicken pieces just before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Oven-baked chicken pieces with basil sauce -- This recipe came
  originally from "The Australian Women's Weekly Dinner Party Cookbook
  No. 2," available at an Australian news agent near you.
  
  *  The sauce sounds unusual but tastes great.  The fresh basil gives
  it a good green colour. Serve with green, vegetables, such as beans
  and snow peas, or a leafy green salad for a colour-coordinated dinner.
  
  *  The finer the ingredients in the topping the better will be its
  effect.

    400 g  14 oz canned chic peas
           Drained
 
  Place the chicken in a large non-porous bowl. Put the chili, cinnamon,
  cumin, cardamom pods and cloves into a spice grinder and grind as
  fine as possible. Rub half the spice mixture into the chicken with
  half the ginger and garlic. Set aside for at least one hour. Cook the
  apricots in the water until tender. Leave to cool in the pan. Heat a
  wok. Add the oil and cook the onion for 7 minutes stirring
  frequently. Stir in the rest of the ginger and garlic and cook for a
  further minute. Remove the onion mixture. Add the chicken and cook
  for 3 minutes until lightly cooked. Add the remaining spice mixture
  and onion mixture and cook for a further 2 minutes. Stir in the
  tomato pure, vinegar, sugar, chic peas and apricots with the cooking
  juice. Cook for 15 minutes and serve.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH CHIPPED BEEF & BACON
 Categories: Entrees
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8    Chicken breast halves
           -(4 whole breasts)
      4 oz Chipped beef
           -(1 package)
      8 sl Bacon
     13 oz Mushroom soup
           -concentrate (e.g.
           -1 can Campbell's soup)
      1 c  Sour cream
 
  Cut chipped beef into strips.  Line the baking pan with them.
  
  Wrap bacon around chicken.  Put in pan on top of beef.
  
  Mix soup and sour cream.  Pour mixture over chicken. Cover tightly and
  refrigerate overnight, or at least several hours. It comes out better
  if you do it overnight.
  
  Bake in 275 degree F. oven, uncovered, for three hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Succulent and easy chicken -- This recipe makes the most succulent
  and juicy chicken I've had.  It is very easy to make. The only
  drawback is that you have to start the night before you want to serve
  it. It would be a good recipe for when you have company, since you
  can do most of the work the previous day.
  
  *  A note on ingredients for non-US cooks:  "chipped beef" is cooked
  spiced beef cut into very thin slices and packaged for sandwiches. A
  worthy substitute is roast beef sliced very thin and seasoned lightly
  with salt and pepper. A "can of mushroom soup," such as Campbell's
  soup, is 1 1/2 cups of double-strength cream soup concentrate. You
  can substitute the Knorr Swiss dried mushroom soup mix (available
  worldwide) if you make it with a mixture of milk and water. Use 1/2
  of a 70-gram package of soup mix with 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of
  milk. Cook the soup according to package directions, then let cool.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 day waiting, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH CILANTRO~ GINGER & GARLIC*
 Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Main dish, Poultry, Rice/grains
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 sm Bunch fresh cilantro**
           -- washed, torn in pieces
      2 ts Ginger root
           -- peeled, finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and finely chopped
      1    3 to 4 lb. roasting chicken
           Salt and pepper; to taste
    1/2 c  Dry white wine, white wine
           -vinegar or herb vinegar
 
  *Enright called this recipe "Chicken with Coriander, Ginger and
  Garlic" but since coriander usually means cilantro seeds, I've
  changed the name to more accurately reflect the dish's ingredients.
  
  **About 1/3 cup.
  
  Tuck 1 tb. cilantro, 1 tsp. ginger and 1 tsp. garlic into the cavity
  of the bird.  Place chicken and remaining ingredients in a large,
  heavy plastic bag; tie securely. (Or place chicken in a large,
  shallow bowl with marinade ingredients.)  Marinate several hours or
  overnight, turning occasionally.
  
  Remove chicken from marinade, reserving marinade. Truss chicken (tie
  or skewer wings and legs); place in roasting pan. Strain marinade and
  set aside to use for basting.
  
  Roast chicken at 425 F. until beginning to brown (15 minutes), then
  reduce heat to 350 F. and roast until juices run clear when thigh
  joint is pierced (another 40 to 45 minutes). Baste often during
  roasting. Let stand a few minutes before carving.
  
  Enright writes:  "This spicy bird is good served with rice and
  defatted pan juices.  Thicken juices by heating with a little
  whipping cream or beurre manie - equal amounts of butter and flour
  kneaded into a ball."
