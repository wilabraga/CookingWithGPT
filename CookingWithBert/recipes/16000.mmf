      Title: CHOCOLATE WREATH CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Entertain
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 tb Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      3 c  Sugar
      3 c  Water
      6 oz Semisweet chocolate;
           -finely chopped
      1 lb Unsalted butter; softened
      3    Large eggs; lightly beaten
  2 1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
           -Few drops green food colori
           Fresh raspberries, dried
           -cranberries, or cherries,
           -for garnish
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 10-inch tube pan
  with a nonremovable bottom. In a large bowl, sift together the flour,
  baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium pot, combine the
  sugar and water and bring them to a boil. Remove the pot from the
  heat and stir in the chocolate and 1 stick of butter. When the
  chocolate and butter have completely melted, whisk the mixture to
  combine completely. Whisk in the beaten eggs. Pour about half the
  chocolate mixture into the dry ingredients and whisk vigorously to
  thoroughly combine the ingredients and remove any lumps. Working
  quickly, add the remaining chocolate mixture and whisk to combine.
  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 60 minutes,
  until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the
  cake cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, then turn out onto a rack
  to cool completely. In a medium bowl, cream together the remaining 3
  sticks of butter and the confectioners' sugar, until light and
  fluffy. Remove 1/3 cup of the icing, place in a small bowl, and color
  it with a few drops of the green food coloring. Put the remaining
  icing in a pot, add the vanilla. Over low heat, stir the icing until
  it becomes a pourable consistency. (If it overheats, causing the
  butter to spearate, put the icing in the refrigerator to chill and
  stir to bring it back together.) Pour the icing over the cooled cake
  so that it drips down the center and outside. Cluster the red berries
  in groups of 3 on top of the cake. Fill the green icing into a pastry
  bag fitted with a leaf tip and pipe a few leaves around each cluster
  of berries. Serves 12 to 16. Source:"An Edible Christmas" (A Treasury

      2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
           -(preferably Dutch process)
      2 tb Light corn syrup
      1 tb Granulated sugar
 
  PREPARE THE CAKE LAYERS:  Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line two 9-inch
  round cake pans with waxed paper; butter and flour the pans; tap out
  any excess flour. In a mixer bowl, beat the butter until light and
  fluffy. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until smooth.
  One at a time, beat in the eggs until well-blended. Sift together the
  flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt.  Add to the egg
  mixture in thirds, alternating with the milk, mixing only until
  blended. Blend in the vanilla and liqueur. Divide the batter between
  the two prepared pans.  Bake until the tops of the cakes are springy
  to the touch, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and set on racks
  to cool for 30 minutes. Loosen the edges with a knife and unmold.
  Peel off the waxed paper.  Set the cakes on a rack and let cool
  completely. PREPARE THE FILLING: Combine the sugar, cream, chocolate
  and corn syrup in a small heavy saucepan. Bring to a simmer over
  moderate heat, stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and cook
  for 10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat,
  dot the top with the butter and let cool to room temperature, about
  15 minutes. When cool, stir in the butter until the fudge filling is
  smooth and creamy. PREPARE THE CHOCOLATE CREAM: Beat the cream and
  cocoa until soft peaks form. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar
  and continue beating until stiff. ASSEMBLE THE CAKE:  Cover one cake
  layer with all of the fudge filling. Sprinkle evenly with the
  chocolate chips. Spread 1/2 cup of the chocolate cream on top of the
  chips.  Top with the second cake layer and cover the top and sides of
  the cake iwth half of the remaining chocolate cream. Use the
  remainder in a pastry bag to decorate the cake as desired.
  Refrigerate for up to 3 hours before serving time. PREPARE THE SYRUP:
  Combine the cocoa, corn syrup, sugar and 2 tablespoons of water in a
  small heavy saucepan. Bring to a simmer over low heat and cook,
  stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Transfer the syrup to a small
  bowl and let cool to room temperature, stirring once or twice, to
  prevent a skin from forming. Just before serving, drizzle the syrup
  over the top of the cake in a lacy design.

      8 oz Tofu
      2 c  Granular sweetener

      1 c  Water
      1 tb Vanilla extract
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Cocoa powder
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Cream of tartar

MMMMM---------------------MOCHA FUDGE GLAZE--------------------------
    1/4 c  Margarine or oil
    1/4 c  Cocoa powder
      3 tb Water
      1 ts Instant espresso powder
  1 1/2 c  Granular sweetener
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Ground cinnamon for garnish
 
  For CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 F.  Oil a 10- or 12-inch springform
  pan; dust lightly with a bit of cocoa powder.
  
  Using electric mixer, blend tofu with sweetener on low speed until
  mixture is paste-like.  Increase speed and beat until tofu is
  thoroughly blended and mixture is shiny and the consistency of thick
  syrup. (Don't worry about undissolved granules of sweetener which may
  remain; they will dissolve later on when the liquids are added.)
  
  Add oil, water and vanilla to tofu mixture, beating until thoroughly
  combined.  Sift together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, cream of
  tartar, and cocoa powder. Blend sifted dry ingredients into liquid
  mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake until tester inserted
  in center comes out clean, about 40-50 minutes. Transfer to rack and
  cool completely.
  
  GLAZE: In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients. Cook and stir
  over medium heat until mixture is shiny and completely smooth. Let
  mixture come to a boil, then immediately remove from heat. Let cool
  10 minutes. Stir vigorously before using.
  
  To assemble cake:  Remove sides from pan.  If necessary, slice off
  top of cake to make surface even, then invert cake on rack set over a
  pan to catch drips of excess glaze. Remove pan bottom from cake. Pour
  glaze evenly over top of cake, allowing some to drip down sides also.
  Use a knife or spatula to spread glaze around sides. Transfer to
  serving platter. Decorate by sprinkling additional ground cinnamon
  over cake, using stencils to create shapes or a pattern if desired.
  
  Variation: A mixture of chopped toasted nuts and ground cinnamon may
  be pressed onto sides of freshly glazed cake instead of sprinkling
  plain cinnamon over top.

  Dip biscotti in chocolate the day they are to be served. In the top
  of a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips with the shortening,
  stirring frequently.  (If you're *really* ambitious, add a little
  chocolate wax to get a good do on it.)  Remove from heat and stir
  until a candy thermometer read 85 F. Holding each cookie by its
  bottom, gently dip the tops into chocolate.  Turn immediately and
  allow to dry, uncoated side down, on wax paper.  Repeat until all are
  done.

 Categories: Candies, Dips, Fruit
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           Fresh Louisiana strawberries
           Candymaker's chocolate
           (milk, dark, or white);
           Look for chocolate labelled

  Wash the strawberries well, but do not remove stems. Spread the
  berries on towels or absorbent paper in a single layer, and allow to
  air dry until all water has evaporated (chocolate will not adhere
  properly if the berries are damp). Melt 1/2 pound chocolate in a
  double boiler deep enough to cover strawberries. Holding the berries
  by the stem, hand dip each one 3/4 of the way up to the top. Place on
  waxed paper and allow to harden or refrigerate until hard. Keep
  refrigerated until ready to serve. Walt MM

      Title: CHOCOLATE-FILLED FILO TRIANGLES
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
        6 oz bittersweet chocolate
      1/2 c  granulated sugar
        8    sheets filo -- defrosted
        8 TB unsalted butter(1 stick) --
  :          melted
  :          Equipment
  :          An 11- by 17-inch baking
  :          tray,
  :          lined with parchment paper
  
  Break up 4 ounces of chocolate into 1/2-ounce pieces. Set aside. In a
  food processor, finely grind the remaining chocolate with the sugar.
  Lay 8 sheets of filo out on top of each other. Place one sheet
  lengthwise on the work surface. Keep the remaining sheets covered
  with a damp towel.
  
  Brush the sheet with some melted butter. Sprinkle with 1 1/2
  tablespoons of the sugar mixture. Place a second sheet over the
  sugared sheet. Butter the second sheet and sprinkle with the sugar
  mixture. Add 2 more sheets, buttering and sprinkling between each.
  
  Cut the filo horizontally into 4 even strips. Starting at the left
  side of one of the strips, place a 1/2-ounce piece of chocolate 2
  inches from the end. Fold the filo that is to the left of the piece
  of chocolate over the chocolate toward the back side of the strip,
  making a 3-inch triangle. The left end of the filo should be even
  with the back edge. Fold the piece of chocolate to the right, over
  itself, retaining the triangular shape. Fold the chocolate piece
  toward the front edge of the strip. Continue wrapping the chocolate,
  alternating
  
  the direction with each fold, until you get to the end. (It is like
  folding a flag.) Wrap the other strips in the same manner. With the
  remaining sheets, make 4 more chocolate-filled triangles. Preheat the
  oven to 350 degrees. Place the triangles on the baking sheet. Bake
  until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Serve warm.

      Title: CHOCOLATE-FRESH SPEARMINT ICE CREAM
 Categories: Ice cream
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
  1 1/2 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Sugar
      3    Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 oz Semisweet chocolate
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      1 c  Fresh spearmint leaves*
      2 tb Fresh spearmint leaves;
           -chopped
 
  *Leaves are "hardpacked:" measure by pressing down on leaves in
  measuring cup with your fingers.
  
  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
  stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
  Do not boil.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
  cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
  back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
  constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
  curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
  the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
  and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
  finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
  175-180 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
  vanilla.
  
  While heating the ice-cream base, melt the chocolate in a double
  boiler over hot but not simmering water, stirring occasionally.
  
  Off heat, pour about 1 cup of the prepared hot ice-cream base into the
  melted chocolate and whisk until well blended. Pour the chocolate
  mixture back into the remaining vanilla base and whisk again. Stir in
  the hard-packed mint leaves. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for
  at least 1 hour. The longer it is refrigerated, the stronger the mint
  flavor will be.
  
  Strain the mixture and add the chopped mint leaves. Pour the mixture
  into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's
  instructions.

    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2    Egg whites
      1 ts Vanilla
      3 oz Bittersweet chocolate
           -OR
    1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
 
  Preheat oven to 400'F. Generously grease 4 cookie sheets. Beat butter
  and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy. Blend in flour. In
  clean, dry bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Blend into butter
  mixture with vanilla.
  
  Using measuring teaspoon, place 4 mounds of dough, 4" apart, on each
  prepared cookie sheet. Spread mounds with back of spoon dipped in
  water to 3" diameter. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, 5-6 minutes or until
  edges are just barely golden. (Do not overbake or cookies become
  crisp too quickly and are difficult to shape.) Remove from oven and
  quickly loosen each cookie from cookie sheet with thin spatula. Shape
  each into a cone; cones become firm as they cool. (If cookies become
  too firm to shape, return to oven for a few seconds to soften.)
  
  Melt chocolate in small bowl over hot, not boiling, water. Stir until
  smooth. When all cookies are baked and cooled, dip flared ends into
  melted chocolate. Let stand until chocolate is set. If desired, serve
  cones by standing them in a bowl. (Adding about 1" of sugar to bottom
  of bowl may be necessary to hold them upright.)

      Title: CHOCOLATE-HAZELNUT TRUFFLES PART 1
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------HAZELNUT PRALINE---------------------------
      1 c  Whole hazelnuts
      1 c  Sugar

MMMMM--------------------------TRUFFLES-------------------------------
      8 oz Semisweet chocolate;
           -finely chopped
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter; chilled and
           -cut into 8 pieces
      3 tb Brewed coffee
      1 tb Hazelnut liqueur (Frangelico
    2/3 c  Hazelnut Praline
           Unsweetened cocoa powder

MMMMM--------------------------COATING-------------------------------
     12 oz Semisweet chocolate;
           -finely chopped
      6 tb Hazelnut praline
 
  Make the praline: 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the
  hazelnuts on a baking sheet. Toast for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the
  smell permeates the air. To see if the nuts are toasted, cut one in
  half; it should be golden brown in the center. Remove from the oven
  and let cool slightly. To remove the skins, place the nuts on a towel
  and rub; the skins will slip off.
  
  2. Lightly oil a sheet of foil; set aside.
  
  3. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the sugar, stirring
  occasionally. It should start to melt after about 6 minutes. The
  sugar will be lumpy and granular, and look like a mistake.
  Persevere!. Within the next few minutes, those lumps will melt into a
  smooth, amber-colored liquid. Lower the heat and stir in the toasted
  hazelnuts, coating the nuts thoroughly. The mixture will be very
  sticky. Immediately scrape the mixture with a metal spoon (do not use
  a rubber spatula) onto the foil, spreading it out. Use a metal spoon
  dipped in water to flatten it. The praline will become brittle and
  difficult to pour as soon as you remove it form the heat, and you
  will not be able to scrape every last drop from the pan -- don't
  worry. (To clean the pan, soak it in hot, soapy water. The sugar will
  dissolve.)
  
  4. Let the praline cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Break
  it into pieces and put it in a food processor. Pulse to chop as
  finely as possible into a lumpy powder. You should have 2 cups; the
  praline can keep idefinitely in an airtight container in the freezer.
  
  Make the truffles: 5. In a microwave-safe medium bowl, combine the
  chopped chocolate and the butter. Heat on high for 1 minute. Stir
  until smooth. If the chocolate is still fairly solid, heat for
  another 30 seconds. Stir the mixture until smooth. If there still
  seem to be several unmelted pieces of chocolate, heat again for about
  20 seconds, and then stir.
  
  6. Add the coffee and hazelnut liqueur and stir until smooth.
  
  7. Add the hazelnut praline and mix in thoroughly.

  *     There should be 16 squares of semi-sweet chocolate and they
  should ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~------------- ~-- One to Three Days In Advance: Preheat oven to 425
  degrees F. Butter bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan. Line
  bottom with parchment or waxed paper.  Using heavy-duty aluminum
  foil, wrap foil under and up outside of spring form pan to prevent
  leaks; set aside. In 3-qt saucepan, combine cut-up chocolate and
  butter.  Cook over low heat, stirring often, until chocolate and
  butter melt and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat; cool 15 minutes.
  Meanwhile, with whisk, beat eggs and sugar over hot, but not boiling,
  water, until eggs are lukewarm and foamy and sugar is dissolved.
  Transfer to large bowl. Beat egg mixture at high speed until very
  thick and pale yellow--about 8 minutes. Beat in flour. Spoon about
  one fourth egg mixture into cooled chocolate. Fold chocolate back
  into remaining egg mixture.  Pour into prepared pan. Place pan in
  deep roasting pan. Fill with enough hot water to come 2/3rds of the
  way up the side of springform pan. Bake 15 minutes (mixture will
  still be soft in center). Place cake on wire rack; remove foil;
  carefully loosen edge of cake with a sharp knife or metal spatula.
  DO NOT remove side of springform pan. Cool at room temperature 1
  hour.  Refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days. On day of serving
  prepare glaze: In small saucepan, combine heavy cream and chocolate.
  Cook over low heat, stirring often, until chocolate melts and mixture
  is smooth. Chill until thick enough to spread but still pourable--20
  minutes. Loosen cake and remove sides of springform pan. Invert cake
  onto serving plate. Carefully remove bottom of springform pan and
  parchment paper. Spread some of the glaze on side of cake. Pour
  remaining glaze on top, spreading with a spatula to form a smooth
  surface. Let cake stand at room temperature about 30 minutes to set
  glaze before decorating with white candy roses.

 Categories: Desserts, Breads, Chocolate
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Sugar, brown, light
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Butter, sweet; chilled
    3/4 c  Peanut butter, creamy
    1/4 c  Milk
      2    Egg
      2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Peanuts, unsalted; chopped
  1 1/2 oz Chocolate, bittersweet; brok
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, stir together the
  flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into
  1/2-inch cubes and distribute them over the flour mixture. With a
  pastry blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in the butter
  until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, stir
  together the peanut butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla. Add the peanut
  butter mixture to the flour mixture and knead until combined. Knead
  in the peanuts. Pat the dough out into a 1/2-inch thickness on a
  cutting board. Useing a floured 2-1/2-inch to 3-inch diameter
  crinkled round biscuit cutter, cut out rounds from the dough. Gather
  the scraps together and repeat until all the dough is used and there
  are 16 rounds. Place 8 of the rounds on an ungreased baking sheet.
  Top each round with a piece of the chocolate and one of the remaining
  circles of dough. Press the edges gently to seal. Bake for 17 to 19
  minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove the baking sheet to a wire
  rack and cool for 5 minutes. Using a spatula, transfer the scones to
  the wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cool completely and store in an
  airtight container. Yield: 8 scones. VARIATION: Make the dough as
  above, omitting bittersweet chocolate, substituting 1/2 cup unsalted
  whole peanuts for the chopped peanuts and kneading in 3/4 cup of
  semisweet chocolate chips at the same time. Pat the dough into a
  9-inch diameter circle on a baking sheet. With a serrated knife, cut
  into 8 wedges. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, or until a cake tester or
  toothpick inserted into the center of a scone comes out clean. Cool
  as above and recut into wedges, if necessary.

    1/4 c  Cocoa
      1 ts Baking Soda
      1 tb Butter
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup
    1/4 c  Whipping (Heavy) Cream
  1 1/4 c  Salted Peanuts
 
  Yield: About 1 Pound Of Candy
  
  Adding chocolate to peanut brittle makes the brittle taste different
  from any you've ever had before.
  
  Lightly butter a cookie sheet and set aside.  In a small bowl, stir
  together the cocoa and baking soda then add the butter. Set aside. In
  a heavy 2 quart saucepan, stir together the sugar, corn syrup, and
  whipping cream.  Cook, over medium heat, stirring constantly until
  the sugar is dissolved.  Stir in the peanuts. Continue cooking,
  stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches 300 Degrees F. or when
  syrup dropped into very cold water separates into threads which are
  hard and brittle. (Make sure that the bulb of the candy thermometer
  is not resting on the bottom of the pan when using one.) Remove from
  the heat and stir in the cocoa mixture. Immediately pour onto the
  prepared cookie sheet. With tongs or wooden spoons, quickly spread
  and pull into a 1/4-inch thickness. Place the cookie sheet on a wire
  rack to cool completely. When the candy is cold, snap into pieces and
  store in a tightly covered container.

      Title: CHOOSING BEEF
 Categories: Beef, Info
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  First, look at the cut of the beef.  Meat from the part of the animal
  that works the least, i.e. the tenderloin, short loin, top portions
  of the rump, is gonna be more tender than meat from the parts of the
  animal that work a lot, such as the chuck (front shoulder), brisket,
  bottom rump, etc. If you're planning on cooking the meat using a dry
  heat method (broiling or roasting), go for cuts from the tender
  section of the cow. For moist heat methods (braising and stewing),
  meat from the less tender sections is fine, and may be preferable
  because of the additional flavor found in these cuts.
  
  Next look at color.  The nice, red meat you associate with a good
  piece of cow is NOT gonna be particularly good eating. Ideally, the
  meat should be a darker, less appetizing color, which means that the
  enzymes in the meat have been working a bit, and some aging has taken
  place.
  
  Now, look at the cut of meat itself.  If it looks nice and lean, with
  no fat marbling in the meat itself, forget it. If you broil meat like
  that, it's gonna be tough as the proverbial boot. Instead, choose the
  piece that everyone else is rejecting 'cause it has some streaks of
  fat in the middle of the meat, maybe a little more outside fat
  coating than is politically correct.
  
  Also look at the texture of the meat.  All muscle contains two kinds
  of connective fibers, called collagen and elastin. These fibers
  bundle the individual strands of muscle together, and allow the
  muscle bundles to function.  When exposed to heat, they contract,
  toughen, and make the end product tough. In dry heat cooking, look
  for a piece of meat with a velvety surface, indicating that these
  bundles are not overly developed.
  
  In moist heat cooking, collagen softens and dissolves, and becomes
  gelatin. Elastin, unfortunately, doesn't do much of anything except
  transform itself into gristle.
  
  Finally, if in any doubt whatsoever as to the overall tenderness of
  the meat, you can resort to treating meat to be broiled with a
  commercial meat tenderizer containing papin. If you follow the
  directions exactly (more/longer exposure to this enzyme is NOT
  better, and will result in a flabby, disgusting mouthfeel), you can
  get a pretty decent steak out of some fairly unpromising hunks of
  meat.
  
  Another hint, which your nephew Wes learned the hard way the other
  night, is to avoid steaks with strange, butcher-generated names like
  the plague. He dragged home a couple of little beauties with the
  colorful name of "Ranch Steaks" the other night. (I tried to tell him
  not to buy 'em cause they were gonna be tough, but he didn't seem to
  hear me :-)  He tossed his on the grill, chewed, cussed and chewed
  his way through as much of it as he could manage before consigning
  the remainder to the cat.  I treated mine with papin, cooked it very
  rare, and got something that was marginally edible.
  
  Moral to the story:  If the butcher doesn't thing it will sell under
  its REAL name (in this case Sirloin Tip, which is a polite way of
  saying Heel of Round), he's gonna give it a fancy handle and mark the
  price up 50 cents a pound, just to see who's gullible enough to buy
  it.
  
  Have to agree with Jeff, though.  The quality of beef has gone WAY
  down recently.  Guess its the move toward leaner, lighter beef that's
  the culprit.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again -- there's
  NO WAY lean, unmarbled beef is going to even begin to approach the
  succulence and tenderness of the old-fashioned, un-heart healthy
  stuff we grew up on. Personally, I'd rather feast on the real thing a
  couple of times a year than gnaw my way through my regular portion of
  the tasteless, tough junk we're being subjected to these days.
  
  I realize that in a changing world, the production of old-fashioned,
  grain fed beef is ecologically unsound. In a world with limited
  resources, we just can't devote that much time/grain to feeding a cow
  for my pleasure. But there must be some sort of compromise.
  Personally, I'd rather have a little bit of something REALLY good
  occasionally, than a lot of something mediocre on a regular basis.
  
  I yield the soapbox to the Gentleman from Maryland (or whoever else
  wants to climb on).

      Title: CHOP SUEY (PORK WITH VEGETABLES)
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 ts Oil
      2 c  Cold diced roast pork
      2    Carrots; pared, sliced thin
           -diagonally
      1    Kohlrabi, peeled, quartered,
           -sliced thin
      1    Onion, diced
      1    Chinese vegetables, mixed, c
           -anned; drained
      3 ts Soy sauce
           Water
           Salt
           Rice; cooked
 
  # Note:  Fresh vegetables may be substituted for the canned Chinese
  vegetables. Use about 2 to 3 cups of a combination of thinly sliced
  green or sweet red pepper, celery, mushrooms, etc. plus a cup or so
  of bean sprouts. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet. Add the pork and
  cook, stirring, over high heat for about 1 minute or until any bits
  of fat on the pork are crisp. Add vegetables, soy sauce, and a couple
  of tablespoons of water and toss to mix.  Cover skillet and cook over
  medium heat only until carrots and turnip are crisp-tender. This will
  take less than 10 minutes if the vegetables have been cut thinly
  enough. Stir in 2 tb. cornstarch mixed with about 1 cup of water to
  make a sauce and cook for a minute or less, stirring gently, until
  thickened. Serve with rice. Adapted from: _The Plan-Ahead Cookbook_

      Title: CHOPPED BROCCOLI WITH GARLIC & PECORINO
 Categories: Broccoli
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lg Bunch broccoli
      2 tb Olive oil
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
    1/4 ts Hot red pepper flakes
      2 tb Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Grated pecorino cheese
           Salt
 
  (From "More Vegetables, Please" by Janet Fletcher. Harlow and Ratner;
  $16.95)
  
  Separate the broccoli florets from the stalks. With a vegetable
  peeler or a small, sharp knife, remove the coarse outer layer of the
  stalks to reveal the pale green, tender heart. Cut the stalks into
  1/2" lengths. Cut the florets into pieces approximately the same size
  as teh stems, but keep them separate. You should have about 1 pound
  of broccoli after trimming.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over moderately low heat. Add
  the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the hot
  pepper flakes (use the full 1/4 teaspoon if you want it really
  peppery), broccoli stems, and 1 tablespoon of chicken stock. Cover
  and cook until the broccoli stems are almost tender, about 5-7
  minutes; add a bit more stock if necessary to keep the stems from
  sticking. Add the florets and the remaining tablespoon of stock;
  cover and cook until tender, about 5 minutes, shaking the skillet
  occasionally so that the broccoli cooks evenly. Transfer the broccoli
  to a warm serving bowl; sprinkle with cheese and salt to taste (be
  careful; the cheese is salty). Toss again, then serve.

  refrigerate. Serve with cocktail-size rye bread slices.

    1/4 c  Schmaltz (chicken Fat)
      3    Hard boiled eggs

  Preheat oven to 375 deg. Wash and drain the chicken livers. Remove
  all fat and any discolored spots. If you find one with a green area,
  which is the gall, throw it away. It would make everything taste
  bitter. Arrange the livers on a foil lined baking sheet and bake for
  30 minutes at 375 deg. While livers are baking, saute the onions in
  the schmaltz (chicken fat) until very brown. Peel the eggs and chop
  them coarsely. Place in a bowl of food processor,or blender.Add the
  livers,the sauteed onions,salt and pepper.Pulse the machine until
  everything is ground and mixed together. Serve as an appetizer on a
  bed of lettuce with chopped onion. AN Aside: For real down home
  chopped liver,the whole process should be done in a wooden bowl, with

      Title: CHOPPED LIVER (SULSUM SINE SULSO)
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Chicken livers
    3/4 c  Olive oil
           Salt and pepper
 
     1) Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a frying pan and gently saute
  the chicken livers for 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked
  through.
  
     2) Remove the cooked livers, place in a mixing bowl, and mash well
  with a fork (or use a blender). Add another 1/4 cup of the oil, salt
  and pepper to taste, and mix well with the liver.
  
     3) Place the chopped liver in a serving dish and shape it into the
  likeness of a fish.  Pour the remaining 1/4 cup oil on top of the
  fish. Serve. NOTE: Liquamen (recipe posted earlier) may be used in
  addition to or in place of the salt. Apicius' recipe calls for a fish
  mold; if you have a fish-shaped gelatin mold, you could not be more
  authentic. If it is a large one, however, you may have to double the
  recipe.

      Title: CHOPPED LIVER II
 Categories: Poultry, Jewish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Chicken livers
      1 lg Onion
      2    Garlic cloves
      3 tb Schmaltz (chicken fat;
           -see note below)
      3    Eggs, hard-boiled
 
  Melt the schmaltz in a large frying pan.  Saute the onions and garlic
  in the schmaltz until the onions are tender. Add the chicken livers
  and saute until done. (Livers are done when they are no longer red or
  pink on the inside.)
  
  Chop the cooked livers and onions, along with the hard boiled eggs. I
  always chop by hand, using a chopper and a wooden bowl. Regardless of
  how you chop them, they should be fairly coarsely chopped. Season
  with a little salt and a little more melted schmaltz if things are
  dry.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chopped liver Just like Mom used to make -- This is NOT liver
  pate; it's chopped liver.  And lots of folks who claim to hate liver
  love this stuff.
  
  *  Schmaltz is rendered (melted) chicken fat.  If you want to make
  your own (which I recommend), get some chicken fat (from the butcher,
  or from a chicken you fix; one chicken's fat is plenty). Put the fat
  in a frying pan on low heat. Stir the pieces of fat frequently; if
  there's lots of fat, you can drain the pan into a container to keep
  things from splattering too much. The fat will eventually melt down
  to a tough, dry blob (the griveners, which are pure poison, but I
  love 'em!), at which point you're done rendering. The liquid fat is
  the schmaltz.

      3 tb Red chili powder
      3 tb Salt
      2 tb Hot paprika

      1 tb White vinegar
    1/4 c  Tequila or water
      3 tb Red wine vinegar
 
  (Bon Appetit, May 1986)
  
  Combine pork, chili powder, salt, paprika, garlic, chili flakes and
  oregano in large bowl. Cover mixture and marinate in refrigerator
  overnight.
  
  Soak casings in cold water mixed with distilled vinegar 1 hour.

  Clip out or tie closed any sections with holes. Soak in cold water
  while preparing filling.
  
  Coarsely grind pork misture in meat grinder or processor. Return to
  bowl. Make well in center of meat mixture. Add tequila and red wine
  vinegar to well; knead into meat.
  
  Attach stuffing horn to grinder. (casing can also be stuffed with
  pastry bag fitted with 1/2 inch plain tip, or a kitchen store will
  have a small metal sausage stuffing horn for a few dollars). Wring
  out casings and place one end over horn. Gradually push all of casing
  onto horn, leaving 6 inch overhang. Tie knot in overhang. With one
  hand, feed meat mixture into grinder. Meanwhile, anchor casing on top
  of horn with thumb of other hand, allowing casing to unroll as
  mixture is extruded. Stop occasionally to mold meat. Pierce any air
  bubbles with fine needle. Do not pack too full or sausage will burst
  as filling expands during cooking. Remove horn and knot casing. Knot
  3 inch pieces of string around sausage at 4 inch intervals. Cut into
  individual sausages. Place on paper-towel lined pan and refrigerate
  uncovered overnight.

      Title: CHORIZO #4
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Pork; about 25% fat, coarsly
           -ground (minced)
           Chile peppers of your
           -choice - i often use 6
           -cayennes
      4    Cloves Garlic
      1 sm Red bell pepper; or
           -small handful of red new
           -mex chile flakes
      1 ts Sugar
      2 ts Coriander
      1 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Mustard
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Oregano
      4 ts Paprika
    1/3 c  White vinegar
           Graham cracker crumbs or
           -bread crumbs (maybe about
           -1/2 cup = 4 fl oz)
 
  Method: Basically just get this lot together some how. Here's how I
  do it -
  
  1. Trim the pork, removing all bone. Shove through the coarse plate
  on a KitchenAid grinder (Similar to Kenwood) Cheap cuts of pork are
  fine. Try shoulder or the packs of "assorted loin chops" that they
  often sell here in the US. Butchers will do this for you if you lack
  the tools.
  
  2. Put the chiles garlic and pepper in a mini blender and fragment.
  Or chop with a knife.
  
  3. Put the dry ingredients in electric spice grinder (old coffee
  grinder) or blend them in a pestle and mortar. Sometimes I use fresh
  herbs if available.
  
  4. Put all of the above 1-3 in a large bowl, add the vinegar, and
  stir at low speed until well mixed. The intense color of the paprika
  is a help here. Slowly add crumbs until the mixture is not goopy but
  firm and moist.
  
  5. Dump out on to a generous sheet of shrink wrap (cling film),
  forming into a big sausage shape on the way. Roll up the film to
  enclose. Twist the ends of the film up tightly and tie in knots. Pat
  roll and squeeze the mass into a pleasing shape (get the air out) and
  freeze solid. When you want to use it, it may be sliced easily if
  partly defrosted; then you can refreeze the rest. This is what our
  little family has for breakfast at the weekend with fried potato,
  eggs, bacon and green sauce. No lunch required! Cameron, a.k.a. -

      Title: CHORIZO (MEXICAN SAUSAGE)
 Categories: Pork, Mexican, Meats
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
     20    Sausage casings (pork
           -casings for authentic
           -links)
           Vinegar
      2 lb Lean pork trimmings
      8 oz Beef OR pork fat
      2 md Onions, quartered
      8    Cloves garlic, pressed
    1/2 c  Cider vinegar
    1/4 c  Tequila (optional)
    1/4 c  Ground red chile, mild OR
           -hot
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
  1 1/2 ts Ground comino
      1 ts Ground Mexican oregano
      1 tb Salt
 
  ..I [=Jane Butel] have generally made bulk sausage, as it is much
  easier. Sausage has to be taken out of the casing for most uses
  anyway.
  
  1.  Clean the casings, rinse well with water, then pour vinegar
  through them.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Use a food processor or the coarse blade of a meat grinder, grind
  the meat and fat.  Add the onions, garlic, vinegar, tequila and
  seasonings, using the hotness of chile powder your family and guests
  will prefer.
  
  3.  Stuff the casings.  First cut the casings into 3-ft lengths and
  tie one end together.  Use either a funnel or filling tube to fill
  the lengths. Tie at about 4-inch intervals with heavy thread.
  
  4.  Place on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper. Set on the
  counter for about 2 hours, then refrigerate.
  
  5.  After a day, freeze what you will not use within a week or two.
  Mixture should ripen for at least 8 hours before using.
  
  Notes:  If you have no food processor or grinder, buy triple ground
  pork. Prepare the recipe once and taste for the mildness or hotness
  of the ground red chile. Adjust to suit your taste for the next time
  you make sausage.
  
  Freezing hints: Mold the sausage into 1/2-pound lumps and freeze
  between pieces of foil inside a heavy plastic bag.
  
  Maximum recommended freezer storage:  3 months.
  
  Makes 20 sausages or  2 2/3 pounds bulk sausage.

      1 ts Dried oregano
      1 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Freshly ground coriander

      2    Finely minced garlic cloves
      1 tb White or rice vinegar
      2 tb Tequila
      1 lb Ground pork
 
  Chorizo is a Mexican sausage that can be used in many ways, chief
  among them in breakfast tacos combined with skillet fried potatoes
  and/or scrambled eggs. There are many variations - this is my
  favorite. You can make it in bulk as it freezes well. Cook as you
  would ground beef but on lower heat to avoid burning the spices.
  Combine herbs and spices, tequila and vinegar. Add to pork and mix
  well.

    1/2 lb Homemade chorizo -- to
           Follow
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Medum onion
      5    Cloves garlic -- cut in
           Half
      1 lg Green bell pepper -- sliced
           Thinly
      1 ts Dried oregano leaves

      4    Bay leaves
      1 sm Can
           Sliced
           Tomato sauce
 
  1. Throughly wash and dry the chicken breasts 2. Cut a slit in the
  thickest part to put in the chorizo sausage. Divide the sausage among
  the breasts. 3. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven until hot, put in the
  stuffed chicken breasts, (you can keep them together with toothpicks)
  and brown on all sides.  About 10 min.? drain fat. 4. Add all of the
  remaining ingredients. Heat to boiling, reduce heat, cover and simmer
  until chicken is tender. 5. Remove bay leaves. Arrange the chicken
  breasts on a large platter and serve with  the remaining sauce.  I'd
  serve with rice or hot cooked black beans. Now for homemade Chorizo!
  Secret. Don't buy it at the Supers! There are mystery ingredients
  that you probably wouldn't want to eat. Easy to make, double, and
  freeze for meatballs.
  
  Homemade Chorizo 1 pound ground pork 2 tablespoons oil 2 tablespoon
  red wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
  1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves Pinch of ground

 Categories: Pork, Mexican, Meats
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2 lb Pork tenderloin (ground ok)
      5    Chiles anchos
    1/2 ts Coriander seeds (toasted)
    1/2 ts Peppercorns
    1/8 ts Cumin seeds
      2 tb Sweet paprika
    2/3 c  Mild white vinegar
    1/2 lb Pork fat
      2    Chilies pasilla
      3    Cloves
    1/2 ts Oregano (Mexican Blended)
      4    Garlic cloves (peel/crush)
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      2 fl Vodka (if wanted)
 
  Chop the meat roughly, (or purchase ground pork), together with the
  fat.
  
  Toast the chilies well, turning them from time to time so they do not
  burn. While they are still warm and flexible, slit them open and
  remove the seeds and veins. As they cool off they will become crisp.
  
  Grind the spices together withe the chilies.
  
  Mix the ground spices and chilies with the rest of the ingredients
  and rub them well into the meat with your hands.
  
  Cover the mixture and set it aside in the refrigerator to season for 3
  days, stirring it well each day. (Before using, fry a little of the
  meat and taste to see if it has enough salt and seasoning.)
  
  Normally the meat would be put into sausage casings, however, I just
  use it straight from the bowl.  If you don't want to stuff the meat
  into casings at all, leave it to mature for about a week. Store it in
  containers in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator.

           Urad dal
           Oil; (seasoning)
           Curry leaves; (seasoning)
 
  Peel skin of squash. Cube. Cook with a little water, turmeric and
  salt. When done yet firm, add coconut and green chilli mix. Pour
  seasoning on top. If there's more liquid it becomes kootu, if moist
  but not liquidy then poduthual.
  
  Variations:
  
  Can do plaintanos (raw, green or, if not there, very, very green
  chiquita bananas) for a vazhakai poduthual/thoran. Also can do red
  pumpkin/butternut squash similarly.
  
  An excellent and quick ckakka thoran is also possible. A Thai canned
  product is green jackfruit, already cooked. Just shred this by hand,
  prepare seasoning in 5-6 tablespoons oil and toss crushed coconut and
  green chillies in. Salt. Stir well and remove when thoroughly heated
  through and still moist. This dish needs a fair amount of coconut,
  and the fresh one is preferred.

  The long, slow cooking of sauerkraut with pork spareribs and kielbasa
  mellows the sharp flavor of sauerkraut. Dark rye bread and a crunchy
  salad are all that is needed to complete this meal.
  
  Cut ribs between bones into single pieces. Season to taste with salt
  and pepper. Brown ribs in oil in large skillet. Remove ribs. Add
  garlic, bacon and onion to skillet and saute until onion turns
  golden, stirring occasionally.

  knackwurst, and sausages and set aside. Drain sauerkraut, rinse in
  cold water and squeeze dry.  Drain bacon and pat dry. Chop bacon. Mix
  into sauerkraut and add crushed juniper berries and gin. Add half of
  sauerkraut mixture to crockpot, then add mixed meats and remaining
  sauerkraut, sprinkling with pepper as you go. Pour wine over all and
  cover. Cook about 2 hours on High.
  
  Turn into warmed serving bowl.  Sprinkle with parsley. Serve with
  boiled potatoes.  Pass around mustard  or horseradish, if you wish.
  
  Sylvia's comments: cook on HIGH?  In a crockpot?  Then what's the
  point? I cooked it all day on LOW and everything was falling apart. I
  have a similar recipe that includes apples and brown sugar that I
  like better; this is great for someone who favors bitter tastes, I
  served it with applesauce which cut the bitterness well and the
  result was delicious.

 Categories: Chinese, Cathe
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Chicken breast halves, boned
      1 ts Garlic salt, divided
      2 ts Sherry, divided
      2 ts Cornstarch, divided
      1 lb Shrimp, cleaned and peeled
      3 tb Oil, divided
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      2    Celery stalks, finely
           -chopped
      1 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
           Ginger (1"), peeled
           -and minced
      3    Garlic toes, peeled
           -and minced
      4 c  Rice, cooked, cold
      6 oz Ham, diced
      8 oz Snow peas, fresh or frozen
      2    Eggs, beaten
 
  Note:  Chow Fan is best made the day before you plan to serve it.
  
  Cut boned chicken into 1/2 squares; place in a bowl and sprinkle with
  half the garlic salt, half the sherry and half the cornstarch. Cut
  the peeled shrimp into pieces 1" long. Put them in a bowl with the
  rest of the garlic salt, sherry and cornstarch.
  
  Heat 2 T oil over high heat in a wok or large pan. Add onions and
  celery and stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Add soy sauce; reduce heat to
  medium, cover and steam one minute. Add mushrooms, cover and steam 2
  more minutes. Remove mixture to a large bowl.
  
  Add remaining oil to wok, reduce heat to low and add ginger and
  garlic. Brown lightly, stirring constantly to avoid burning. Add
  chicken and shrimp.  Stir-fry two minutes, or until shrimp are pink
  and opaque.
  
  Add cooked rice, onion mixture and ham.  Stir until hot. Remove from
  heat, put into a storage container and chill overnight. When ready to
  serve, reheat in a wok or large pot. Stir in snow peas and cook two
  minutes. Make a well in the center of the wok and stir in the beaten
  eggs. Stir them as they cook, about 3 minutes, so they scramble and
  mix with the other ingredients. Cover and cook over medium heat
  another couple of minutes. Serve at once.
  
  Serves 12 as part of a family style Chinese dinner, or 4 as a main
  dish.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  When Cathe originally gave me this recipe in the mid 70's it
  called for just 3/4 cup shrimp (1/2 pound), 1/2 cup each diced onion
  and celery, 1/2 cup boiled ham (1/4 lb), 1/2 cup peas (cooked just
  tender), 3 eggs and sprouts. Also, just 1 clove garlic, which was
  heated with the ginger (discarded when brown) before cooking the
  chicken. * I like to add 1/2 c red bell pepper (diced) for color.

        1 c  Onion -- sliced
        6 oz Can mushrooms -- drained

  In hot deep skillet or wok, brown meat in 1 tsp. oil. Remove from
  pan. Add 1 tsp. oil to pan and cook celery and onion until crisp
  tender. Add mushrooms.  Blend cornstarch into water and when smooth
  add chicken broth and  soy sauce.  Put meat back into pan with
  veggies and add bean sprouts and  water chestnuts. Pour sauce over
  all and heat through. Serve over chow mein noodles with steamed rice
  on the side.  Note: to cut down on sodium I rinse all canned
  vegetables well. If you like you can add chopped green peppers, fresh
  mushrooms and thin sliced cabbage when stir frying the vegetables.
   You can also use chicken or beef if you prefer not touse pork. I
  like pork because that's the way my mom always made this recipe.FROM:

 Categories: Chinese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     10 sm Black dried mushrooms
    1/2 lb Fresh Chinese egg noodles
           -(regular mein)
           Sesame oil
    1/2 lb Sea scallops
           Cornstarch
    1/2 lb Flank steak
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoots, sliced
      1 lb Bok choy, cut in 1 1/2-inch
           -lengths
      2    Eggs
  2 1/4 c  Fresh chicken stock
      2 tb Light soy sauce
           Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
           Peanut oil
      1 tb Or more dry sherry or
           -Shaoxing rice wine
 
  Here's a recipe for Chow Mein which is a pretty classic application
  using pan fried noodles.
  
  Put the mushrooms in a small bowl and pour boiling water over them.
  Let soak for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, cook the noodles in a large quantity of boiling water for
  3 1/2 to 5 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water, drain again, toss
  with a little sesame oil and set aside.
  
  Cut The scallops in half, toss with a little sesame oil and 1 1/2
  teaspoons of cornstarch; refrigerate. Cut the flank steak as thinly
  as possible across the grain. Toss with 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch,
  in a little sesame oil and the dark soy sauce; set aside. When the
  mushrooms have soaked, squeeze them out over the soaking liquid, and
  reserve 1/4 cup of the liquid. Cut off the mushroom stems and
  discard; cut the caps in two and set aside with the bamboo shoots and
  bok choy.
  
  Lightly beat the eggs with a few drops of sesame oil. Heat a small
  frying pan and oil the bottom lightly. Pour in enough of the beaten
  egg to cover the bottom, pouring any excess back into the uncooked
  eggs. Cook just until set and remove.  Repeat until all the egg is
  used up. Stack the egg crepes, roll them up and slice across the roll
  into shreds. Set aside.
  
  Mix the chicken stock with the light soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  and the sugar; set aside.  Heat this mixture in a small pot over low
  heat.
  
  Meanwhile, heat a wok over medium high heat until hot. Add 1 cup
  peanut oil and heat until the oil is very hot. Lower the noodles into
  the oil to form a nest and let them cook until brown on one side.
  (This may take 8 minutes or so.) Turn the noodles over and brown on
  the other side. (This will be much faster.) Remove to a large serving
  platter and keep warm.
  
  Cook the scallops very briefly in the same oil, remove and drain in a
  colander.  Turn the heat off under the oil and add the beef. Stir just
  until the meat slices are separated and start to change color. Remove
  to drain with the scallops.
  
  Pour off all the oil but 1/4 cup and heat.  Add the vegetables and
  stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the seasoned stock and bring to a
  boil. Mix the reserved mushroom soaking liquid with 2 tablespoons of
  cornstarch until dissolved and stir into the chicken stock sauce.
  Stir until it thickens and clears slightly. Add the beef and

 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Ground Allspice
    1/2 c  Brown Sugar -- or more
      6    Garlic cloves -- (6 to 8)
      4    Scotch Bonnet Peppers -- (4
           To 6) seeds and all -- (or
           Equivalent)
      1 tb Ground Thyme
           (or 2 TB thyme
           Leaves)
      2 bn Scallions
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
           Soy sauce to moisten
           (2 TBSP)
 
  Put everything in a food processor and blend until smooth. You may use
  allspice berries, if available, but use enough to give the equivalent
  of 1/2 cup ground. This will keep "forever" in the refrigerator. Feel
  free to increase the garlic, and the hot peppers. I do. The recipe,
  double, and triples very well.
    Rub about 1/4 cup sauce into each chicken, halved, and get under
  the skin and in all the cavities. It is pork, use a de-boned
  shoulder, score the fat, and rub the sauce in, using 1/2 cup, or
  more, per 6 lb shoulder. Use less for fish.  Marinate, preferably
  overnight, and grill over a low fire, until done. Charcoal is ideal.
  The meat will be a smoky pink when done, and the skin nice and dark.
  Chop the meat into pieces, and serve traditionally with a hard-dough
  bread, and LOTS of Red Stripe Beer! This is the recipe for a Jamaican
  Jerk Sauce exactly as Christine Morin posted it here some months ago.
  Chris is a restaurant owner, caterer, and chef from Jamaica and this
  is her Jerk Sauce recipe and method. It can be made in bulk,
  refrigerated, and used to marinate chicken (whole, half, or wings,
  pork (chops or deboned shoulder, or fresh picnic), or a firm- fleshed
  fish like grouper or dolphin. It is VERY popular Jamaican eating.....
  and introduces a pepper called a Scotch Bonnet; an extremely
  flavorful and aromatic, and HOT AS ALL HELL Jamaican pepper, that
  makes a jalapeno seem tame, by comparison. The SB, as I know it,
  seems to have "relatives" all over the Caribbean, Central and South
  America, and even into the West coast of the US. One of them is the
  Habanero.

    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Vanilla
      2 c  Candied fruit, mixed
      2 c  Broken pecans or almonds
 
  * firmly packed
  
   The cream cheese gives these cookies a smooth texture, while the
  fruits sparkle and sweeten the flavor. Nice for using the candied
  fruits that didn't make it into the fruit cake.
  
   Preheat oven to 350.
  
   In a large bowl, cream shortening and cream cheese until smooth and
  fluffy. Add sugars and eggs, mixing well. In a seperate bowl, sift
  flour, baking soda and salt together.
  
   Add flour mixture to egg and sugar mixture; add vanilla. Mix well.
  Add candied fruit and nuts.
  
   Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto lightly oiled cookie sheet and bake
  at 350 for about 10-12 minutes. The cookies will be just browned at
  the edges.
  
  Hint: You may have to mix candied fruit and nuts in with your hands; a
  little shortening on your fingers will keep the mixture from sticking.

      Title: CHRISTMAS CAKE (BRITISH)
 Categories: Desserts, Cakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 lb Mixed dried fruit
      4 oz Glace' cherries
      4 oz Candied fruit
      3 oz Blanched almonds
     10 oz Plain flour
      1 x  Pinch salt
    1/4 ts Bicarbonate of soda
      1 ts Mixed spice
      4 x  Eggs
    1/2 ts Flavoring (vanilla, lemon)
      1 tb Blackstrap molasses
      8 oz Butter
      8 oz Soft brown sugar
      1 x  Whisky to soak fruit
    250 ml Milk (to mix)
 
  (Note: (1) The mixed dried fruit should be such things as seedless
  raisins and currants. (2) The 1/2 teaspoon of "flavoring" can be
  almond, or lemon, or vanilla, or a mixture of the three. (3) "Mixed
  spice" is a combination of cinnamon, allspice and mace: about 1/3 of
  each.) -- Find a 9-inch cake pan at least three inches deep; grease
  it, and line the bottom and sides with a double thickness of greased
  baking parchment. Tie folded brown paper or newspaper around the
  outside of the pan. (The paper is insulation, to keep the sides of
  the cake from scorching as it bakes.) Set oven to 320-300F: have
  folded paper to stand the pan on when baking -- place low in oven.
  Pick over the dried fruit, removing any stems, etc. Wash, drain well
  and spread over a cloth on a tray to dry. When dry, put in a bowl and
  pour a small wine-glass of spirit over it. Cover well and leave
  overnight. -- Next day, add chopped peel, blanched chopped almonds,
  and cherries minced and drained. Mix thoroughly. Sift together the
  flour, salt, soda and spice. Beat the eggs well with the molasses and
  flavoring. Put the butter into a large warmed bowl and beat until
  soft; then add the sugar and beat until light and creamy. Beat in the
  egg mixture, about a sixth of it at a time, then fold in half the
  flour mixture. Add remainder of the flour to the fruit and mix well.
  Add fruit to creamed mixture and fold in well. Put into pan and bake
  for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours or until done. If top of cake is browning
  too fast, cover with a few thicknesses of paper. Reduce the oven heat
  slightly every hour -- about 10 degrees. Test with skewer for
  doneness. Keep the paper wrapped around the cake in place until
  completely cooled, so that the cooling takes place slowly. After
  completely cooled, invert the cake, lift the baking parchment off the
  bottom, and sprinkle the cake generously with the spirit of your
  choice. Wrap well in foil, put in a sealed tin, and keep in a cool
  place (not necessarily refrigerated) . The cake benefits from
  occasional unwrappings and sprinkling with more spirit. It takes
  about 2 months to achieve maximum "mellowness".

    1/2 c  Water
    3/4 c  Lt. corn syrup
    3/4 ts Red vegetable coloring
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
 
  Any self-respecting Christmas tree has a right to complain If it isn't
  decked out with a candy cane. The sugar, water, syrup, and cream of
  tartar you combine and heat till the sugar's dissolved real fine.
  Divide into two saucepans, boil, but don't stir, please, Until each
  lot 280 degrees. Add 1/2 ts peppermint to each lot and add the
  coloring to one, the other not: place on an enamel or marble table to
  cool. (First oiling the table, as a general rule). Like taffy you
  stretch and pull and form into ropes of red and white, now twist them
  around again and again.
   And form them into your candy cane.
   Now on an oiled surface you allow them to harden, then announce to
  your family that these is ready for your Christmas tree. FROM:

  Divide the hot espresso into 4 cups.  In a blender, begin whipping
  half of the warm chocolate milk at low speed. Gradually increase the
  speed to high and blend until frothy, about 1 minute. Pour the
  chocolate milk into the cups of coffee, stir briefly and top each
  serving with some of the milk froth.  Sprinkle the reserved cinnamon
  sugar on top. Serve immediately with a dollop of whipped cream, if

 Categories: Main dish, Christmas, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------VEGETABLE STEW----------------------------
      2 oz Oil
      1 lb Onions, sliced
      1 lb Carrots, sliced
  1 1/2 lb Acorn squash
           -- peeled, seeded & diced
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Powdered cinnamon
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/4 ts Ground white pepper, or more
  1 1/2 pt Water or vegetable stock
      1 lb Courgettes
           -- trimmed and sliced
      1 lb Frozen broad beans
           Salt
      1 ea Squeeze lemon juice
      1 ds Sugar
           Chopped fresh coriander

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE GRAIN----------------------------
      1 lb Couscous
      1 ts Salt
      2 oz Butter

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE EXTRAS----------------------------
      1 tb Harissa sauce
     15 oz Canned chick peas, drained
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Cumin seeds
      6 oz Raisins
      4 oz Pine nuts
      8 oz Soy yogurt
           A dusting of paprika
 
  First make the stew.  Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the
  onions and fry for 5 minutes, then add the carrots, squash and
  spices. Cook for a further 10 minutes, with a lid on, stirring from
  time to time until all are buttery and spicy.  Add the water or stock
  and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the vegetables are just
  becoming tender. Add the courgettes and broad beans, and cook for a
  further 5 minutes or so. Season with salt, lemon juice, and a little
  sugar if necessary. (This is best made in advance and reheated, as
  the flavours improve -- it is particularly good after freezing.) Now
  make the grain. This is an unusual way to cook couscous, but I find
  it gives the best results. Put the couscous into a baking tin and add
  1 pint of water; immediately drain this off and return the couscous
  to the tin. Leave it for 20 minutes, separating the grains with your
  fingers after 10 minutes, or more times if you're passing. Put the
  couscous into a sieve or steamer lined with a blue J-cloth. Set over
  a pan of simmering water (it doesn't have to be the stew) for 20
  minutes. Tip the couscous back into the baking tin and pour over 5 fl
  oz cold water with the salt dissolved in it. Sift the grains with
  your fingers and leave for 15 minutes, then put back into the lined
  steamer and heat as above for a further 20 minutes. Sift with your
  fingers into a serving bowl and stir in the butter. Set aside while
  you put together the extras. To assemble and serve, take a ladleful
  of liquid from the stew and add it to the harissa to make a thick
  paste. Put this into a small bowl. Drain the chick peas. In a small
  pan, heat the oil and add the cumin seeds, stirring for a moment or
  two, then add the chick peas and stir until heated through. Put into
  a second small bowl. Cover the raising with boiling water, leave for
  10 minutes or longer to plump, then drain and put into a third small
  bowl. Put the pine nuts into a fourth bowl -- they can be lightly
  toasted if you like. Finally, put the yogurt into a fifth bowl and
  dust the top with some paprika. To serve, ladle the stew over the
  couscous and garnish with chopped fresh coriander.

 Categories: Breakfast, Holiday, Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
      2 c  Cooked rice
      2 c  Smoked yellowfish
    3/4 c  Heavy cream
      1 ts Curry powder
           Salt to taste
      4    Hard boiled eggs
      3 tb Chopped parsley
 
  CHRISTMAS EVE PREPERATION  (20 MINUTES) 1. Prepare hard boiled eggs.
  Cook rice, fluff gently and refrigerate. 2. Prepare fish. You can use
  any fish or shell fish but I use thick
      slabs of smoked yellowfish, or thick slabs of smoked haddock. Thin
      fillets tend to break up into pieces too small. Place fish in pan,
      cover with water, and heat gently until just before boiling point.
      Drain and refrigerate. Allowing fish to boil will turn it into
  mush
      during final cooking. CHRISTMAS MORNING PREPERATION (15 MINUTES)
  1. In a microwave dish or double boiler, melt butter and heat cream
      (reserving 3 T for moisture adjustment). Add cooked rice and mix
  well. 2.  Gently break cold fish into bite size pieces and add to
  mixture.
      Chop hard boiled eggs and add to mixture. 3. Adjust moisture
  before heating mixture. Microwave mixture should be
      moist but not damp. If using doubleboiler to heat mixture, add
  reserved
      cream until mixture is slightly sloppy or it will dry out during
      heating. 4. Heat mixture in microwave on high, stirring every
  minute until hot.
      Garnish with chopped parsley and serve.

    1/2 c  Orange juice
      4 ts Baking powder
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Chopped nuts
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Mashed banana
  2 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
  1 1/2    Mixed candied fruit
 
  Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, raisins, nuts, and candied
  fruit together.  Combine and beat slightly the banana and orange
  juice; Set aside. Beat eggs into Wonderslim/prunes one at a time.
  Alternately, add prune/egg mixture and banana/orange mixture to dry
  ingredients mixed with fruits and nuts.  A wooden "fork" works well
  for the mixing. Pack into 9X5X3 loaf pan lightly sprayed with Pam and
  lined with wax paper. Bake at 350o for 1 hr. or until done.  Cool 20
  min. before removing wax paper and turning out on a rack. Cool before
  icing.
  
  Icing:   Mix powdered sugar into an egg white until smooth and easily
  spreadable.  You want a thin icing. If you get it too thick, add a
  little skim milk.  Dot icing with cut up candied (glace') cherries as
  desired.
  
  After frosting is firm, wrap in aluminum foil and refrigerate.
  Improves with freezing.
  
  Notes:  I usually double or triple the recipe. Otherwise, you'll have
  leftover icing (which is also good on cookies). You can divide the
  dough out into smaller pans; makes nice gifts.
  
  I have modified the original posted recipe for Homemade Wonderslim by
  decreasing the lecithin:
  
  3 c. water 1 12 oz. pk. prunes (cut-up type) 1 T. unbleached lecithin
  1/4 tsp. citric acid
  
  Cover prunes with water and bring to a boil.  Cool. Blend prunes,
  water, lecithin, and citric acid in blender until smooth. Pour in
  clean quart jar and refrigerate. Keeps up to 30 days. I pour mine
  into old jelly jars and freeze them.  I use 1:1 amounts when
  substituting for oleo in recipes.

      Title: CHRISTMAS ORNAMENT COOKIES - COUNTRY LIVING
 Categories: Christmas, Kooknet, Cookies
      Yield: 36 Cookies
 
    1/2 c  (1 stick) butter, softened
    1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
  1 1/3 c  Sugar
      2 lg Eggs
  3 1/2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
           Royal Icing-recipe follows
           Food coloring (see Note)
 
  1.  In large bowl, with electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter
  and shortening until well blended; add sugar and beat until light.
  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
  
  2.  In medium-size bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. With
  mixer on low speed, add half of flour mixture to butter mixture and
  beat until soft dough forms. Shape dough into 3 equal balls; wrap and
  refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
  
  3.  To cut and bake cookies: Heat oven to 350F. Lightly grease 2
  baking sheets.  Cut 2 pieces of waxed paper the same size as the
  baking sheets. Lightly flour waxed paper and roll out one ball of
  dough between paper to 1/8-inch thickness.  Remove top piece of waxed
  paper. Using our 7-inch bauble-shaped cookie cutter, cut out as many
  baubles from dough as possible, leaving 1/2 inch between each shape.
  Remove all trimmings and press together.  Invert waxed paper with
  baubles onto greased baking sheet and peel off waxed paper. Reroll
  trimmings between waxed paper and repeat cutting and inverting
  baubles to fill second baking sheet. If making cookies for ornaments,
  use a toothpick tp pierce a small hole about 1/2 inch from top of
  each cookie.
  
  4.  Bake cookies 8 to 10 minutes or until golden. Cool 5 minutes on
  baking sheets, then remove to wire racks and cool completely before
  decorating. Repeat rolling, cutting, and baking with remaining balls
  of dough and trimmings.
  
  5.  To decorate cookies as pictured in the magazine (plaid), prepare
  Royal Icing.  Divide icing in half, placing one half in a medium-size
  bowl. Divide remaining half of icing among 3 small bowls or cups.
  Tint icing in medium-size bowl pale yellow with yellow food coloring
  (see Note). Mix one small bowl of icing with burgundy food coloring,
  another with teal food coloring, and the last bowl with violet food
  coloring. Spoon icings (except yellow) into separate small pastry
  bags fitted with small (#1) writing tips.  With pastry brush, paint
  the front of each cookie with a think coat of the yellow icing, being
  sure not to cover pierced hole; let dry and paint again.  When yellow
  icing has dried, pipe decorateive lines, dots and curls on front of
  cookies using other colored icings. To store cookies, place them in a
  single layer in airtight containers.
  
  ROYAL ICING: In large bowl, with electric mixer on low speed, beat
  two 1-lb packages confectioners' sugar, 6 large egg whites (if
  cookies will be eaten, use meringue powder and follw package
  instructions for Royal Icing: see Note), and 1 teaspoon cream of
  tartar until mixed. Increase speed to high, beat until very thick and
  fluffy-about 6 minutes. Cover tightly with plastic wrap to prevent
  drying until ready to use. Makes 4 cups.
  
  Note: We used Wilton's Egg Yellow, Burgundy, Teal and Grape Violet
  food coloring and meringue powder, which can be purchased wherever
  cake decorating supplies are sold or by calling Wilton Industries at
  (800) 772-7771.

  and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 3. Add the sausage, ground
  beef and pancetta to the pan. Cook over moderate heat, stirring to
  break up the meat, until the beef and sausage are no longer pink.
   Drain off any fat. Season with the salt, pepper and nutmeg. 4. Pour

      Title: CHRISTMAS SAVOURY STRUDEL
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Studel
 
      3 tb Olive oil
      2    Onions; chopped
      2    Garlic cloves (or more)
           -- crushed
     28 oz Canned tomatoes in juice
      1 ts Dried basil
      3 fl Red wine
      8 oz Buttom mushrooms
           -- washed & sliced
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
     10 oz Filo pastry
      4 oz Butter; melted
  3 1/2 oz Roasted cashew nuts
           -- roughly chopped
 
  Heat the oil in a fairly large saucepan, add the onions and cook
  them, with the lid on the pan, for about 10 minutes, until they are
  tender but not browned.  Add the garlic, the tomatoes together with
  their liquid, the basil and the wine.  Let the mixture simmer gently
  without a lid on the pan, stirring from time to time, until the
  liquid has disappeared and it is quite thick - this will take about
  20 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for a further 5 minutes or so,
  or until the mushrooms are tender and any liquid which they make has
  boiled away. Remove from the heat and season to taste.
  
  When the filling mixture has cooled, you can assemble the strudel,
  which can then be cooked straight away, or kept in the fridge for a
  few hours until you're ready, or in the freezer for at least a month.
  I find it easiest to assemble the studel directly on to a large
  baking sheet, which means you don't have to lift it later.
  
  Set the oven to 200 C/400 F/Gas Mark 6.
  
  If you have the type of filo pastry which is long and narrow -- about
  30 x 20 cm (12 x 8 inches) -- lay two sheets side by side,
  overlapping them slightly where they join. If you have the type which
  is quite large ~- about 30 cm (12 inches) or so square -- lay out one
  sheet. Either way, brush the surface with a little melted butter and
  then sprinkle with a third of the nuts. Put another layer of filo
  pastry on top, brush with butter, and scatter with nuts. Repeat with
  another layer, then a final layer of filo pastry, which you just
  brush with butter. Now tip the tomato filling mixture on top and
  spread it to about 2.5 cm (1 inch) of the edges. Fold the edges over,
  to enclose the edge of the filling then, starting from one of the
  widest edges, roll the whole thing up like a Swiss Roll, trying not
  to let it break (although it's not the end of the world if it does).
  Brush with melted butter and garnish with some shreds or shapes of
  filo pastry.
  
  Put the strudel into the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until golden
  brown.  Transfer carefully to a serving dish with the aid of two fish
  slices.

  thoroughly blended, to make a soft dough.
  
  To make bars: on work surface dusted with flour, pat dough into
  rectangle 1/2" thick, 2" wide, and about 17" long. Use knife or
  fluted pastry cutter to cut into 1" bars. Use spatula to transfer
  bars to ungreased cookie sheet, leaving 1" between bars. Prick each
  bar with fork several times. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until lightly
  colored. Do not overbake; the bars should not brown.  Let cool on
  cookie sheet for one minute, then carefully transfer to wire racks to
  finish cooling.
  
  To make wedges: Dust your hands and ungreased cookie sheet with
  flour. Pat dough into ball. Pat ball into flat disk about 1/2" thick
  and 7" in diameter on cookie sheet. With edge of plastic ruler dusted
  with flour, mark disk in 8 wedges, cutting about halfway through
  dough, and prick dough all over and crimp edges with fork. Bake for
  30 minutes, then take cookie sheet out and cut through shortbread on
  marked lines. Return shortbread to oven for five more minutes. Let
  wedges cool on cookie sheet for one minute, then carefully transfer
  to wire racks to finish cooling.

      Title: CHRISTMAS STARS
 Categories: Cookies, Christmas
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
MMMMM--------------------------COOKIES-------------------------------
      1 c  Solid shortening
           -(NOT butter)
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
      2    Eggs
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Almond flavoring
  2 3/4 c  Flour

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      2 tb Cream or milk
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla (not Mexican,
           -unless you like
           -tan frosting)
           Food coloring
 
  Cream together the shortening and sugar.  Beat in the eggs, salt and
  flavorings.  Stir in the flour until blended. Chill in the
  refrigerator for an hour or two.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Roll out on a floured surface to a
  thickness of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut with the cookie cutters of
  your choice (this was always a cause for argument in our family).
  Bake on ungreased cookie sheets until tan around the edges, about
  8-10 minutes. Allow to cool.
  
  Make the frosting by beating together the sugar, milk and vanilla
  until smooth.  Divide and color each portion. Frost the cookies.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Frosted cookie-cutter cookies -- My mom got this recipe many years
  ago in a cookbook that came in installments, so it didn't have a name
  on the binder and I don't know what it was called. She had us (the
  kids) make these cookies every year. Yield: 2-4 dozen.
  
  *  These cookies are about the only ones I know that taste better
  cooked and cold than as raw dough.
  
  *  Cinnamon red hots make good eyes for animals or Santas.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling, 15 minutes rolling
  and baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: CHRISTMAS STOLLEN
 Categories: Breads, Swedish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Plus 2 Tbsp granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water
      5 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Finely chopped candied
           -citron
    1/2 c  Finely chopped candied
           -cherries
      1 c  Slivered almonds
           Grated rind of 1 lemon
      1 c  Seedless raisins
      2    Eggs, beaten
      1 c  (2 sticks) butter, softened
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    2/3 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
      2 tb Hot water
 
  Pour milk into a saucepan. Heat to scalding. Turn off heat; stir in
  1/2 cup of the granulated sugar and the salt. Let mixture cool to
  lukewarm. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in the 1/2 cup warm water;
  let mixture rest for 5 minutes. Pour lukewarm milk mixture into yeast
  solution. Stir in 1 cup of the flour. Beat dough with electric mixer
  or egg beater until smooth. Cover bowl with cloth towel; let dough
  rise in a warm place 1 hour and 30 minutes or until double in bulk.
  
  Punch down dough in bowl; fold in citron, cherries, almonds, lemon
  rind and raisins. Add eggs, 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) of the softened
  butter and the nutmeg. Stir in 3 more cups flour; mix dough until
  smooth. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead, working
  in enough of remaining flour to make dough smooth and elastic. Divide
  dough into halves; roll each portion into an oval, about 1/2" thick.
  
  In a small saucepan, melt remaining butter; brush it over ovals. In a
  small bowl, combine cinnamon with remaining 2 Tbsp granulated sugar;
  sprinkle mixture over ovals. Fold ovals in half, lengthwise. Place
  them on buttered baking sheet. Twist ends of each oval toward each
  other to form a crescent. Loosely cover ovals with wax paper and a
  cloth towel. Let Stollen rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until
  double in bulk.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake Stollen 45 minutes or until golden.
  In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar with enough of the hot
  water to make a thick icing. Dribble icing over hot Stollen; let
  Stollen cool before slicing. Makes 1 Stollen.

      Title: CHRISTMAS STOLLEN (QUICK-BREAD VARIETY)
 Categories: Holiday, Breads, Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour (all-purpose)
      2 ts Baking powder
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Mace
      8 x  Cardomon seed pods, seeds
           Removed and crushed
    3/4 c  Almonds, blanched, ground
    1/2 c  Butter, soft
      1 c  Cream cheese, softened
      1 lg Egg
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Almond extract
      2 tb Brandy
    1/2 c  Currants
    1/2 c  Golden raisins
    1/3 c  Candied lemon peel, chopped
    1/4 c  Butter, melted
    1/4 c  Sugar, powdered
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the flour, baking powder,
  sugar, salt, mace, and crushed cardamon seeds. Stir in the ground
  almonds. Cut in the soft butter until the mixture looks something
  like coarse sand. In a blender, cream the egg with the cream cheese,
  vanilla, almond extract, and brandy. Pour it into a bowl and stir in
  the dried fruit. Gradually stir in the flour mixture until everything
  is is well blended. Work the dough into a ball and turn it out on a
  lightly floured board. Knead it for a few minutes until it is smooth,
  then place it in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.  (You can
  store the dough in the refrigerator for several days, then take it
  out to bake when ever you like.) Shape the dough into a flat, oval
  loaf, about 10 inches long and eight inches wide. With the blunt edge
  of a knife, crease the loaf about 1/2 inch off center, down the
  length of it.  Fold the smaller side of the creased loaf over the
  wider side. Brush the top of the folded loaf with the melted butter.
  Place the stollen loaf on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for
  about 45 minutes, until it starts to turn brown on the outside.
  Remove and allow to cool a little bit. Dust lightly with powdered
  (i.e., confectioner's) sugar.

 Categories: Cyberealm, Breads, Christmas
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/8 lb Flour
      7 oz Sugar
      1 pn Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Lemon juice
      4 tb Rum
      1 pn Cardomom (generous)
      1 pn Mace (generous)
      2    Eggs
  4 1/2 oz Butter
  4 1/2 oz Currants well drained
      9 oz Sultanas
      9 oz Almonds, finely chopped
  3 1/2 oz Candied lemon peel
  1 3/4 oz Butter for brushing
      2 tb Powdered sugar for dusting
  1 3/4 oz Beef drippings
      9 oz Cottage cheese, well drained
 
  Mix and sieve together the flour and baking powder onto a pastry
  board or cool slab. Make a well in the center and pour in the sugar,
  vanilla, rum, lemon juice, and the eggs. Draw in some flour from the
  sides of the well to mix with these and form a thick paste. Add the
  cold butter, cut into small pieces, the finely chopped beef
  drippings, cottage cheese, currants, sultanas, nuts and candied peel.
  Cover the fruits with more of the flour, and then starting from the
  middle, work all of it together quickly with your hands into a firm,
  smooth paste. If it should stick, add a little more flour. Form the
  mix into a long, oval shape, and then fold it over lengthwise to give
  it the traditional "stollen" shape.
  
  Line a baking dish with greased waxed paper and place stollen on this.
  
  Preheat the oven for 5 minutes at 500F. Then bake at a moderately hot
  over (375F) for 50-60 minutes. As soon as the stollen comes out of
  the oven, brush with melted butter and dust thickly with powdered
  sugar.

      Title: CHRISTMAS TIRAMISU
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 lb Mascarpone or soft cream
           Cheese
    3/4 c  Sugar
      8 lg Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sweet wine
      2 c  Expresso or very strong
           Black coffee (approx)
      9 oz Ladyfingers or 14 oz. angel
           Food or sponge cake, thinly
           Sliced
      1 tb Unsweetened cocoa
 
  1. In a small bowl, using a fork, beat the cheese until creamy. Set
  aside.
  
  2. Place a large (about 10-12 cups capacity) metal bowl over a pot of
  boiling water. Using a hand-held electric mixer set on medium high,
  beat the sugar and egg yolks in the bowl for 1 minute, or until the
  mixture is well blended. With the mixer set on low speed to prevent
  splashing, gradually add the wine. Continue to cook and beat the
  mixture, increasing the speed to medium and then to high as the
  mixture thickens. Cook and beat for 5-7 minutes, or until the mixture
  is thickened and light, scraping down the sides of the bowl
  frequently with a rubber spatula.
  
  3. Remove the bowl from the heat and continue to beat the mixture for
  1 minute longer. Beat in the cheese just until blended (makes about 5
  cups).
  
  4. Pour one cup of the expresso into a small shallow bowl that is
  large enough to hold a ladyfinger if it is placed horizontally in the
  bowl.
  
  5. Quickly dip the rounded top side of each ladyfinger into the
  expresso. Only the top half of the ladyfingers should be soaked with
  the expresso. If the ladyfingers get too wet, they will fall apart!
  Add more coffee to the bowl as needed.
  
  6. Place the ladyfingers, flat side down, in the bottom of a 13 x 9
  glass or ceramic pan. Do not use a metal pan. Form one layer. Pour
  half of the custard mixture over the ladyfingers and spread to cover
  them. Dip the remaining ladyfingers in the expresso (there will be a
  few remaining ones and form a second layer over the custard mixture.
  Pour the remaining custard mixture over the ladyfingers and spread to
  an even layer.
  
  7. Place the cocoa in a strainer and dust the top of the tiramisu
  evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 10 hours.
  
  Makes: 10-12 servings.

      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      6 oz Plain flour
    1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
      1 ts Ground mixed spice
      2 oz Butter, chilled and cubed
      3 oz Soft light brown sugar
      2 tb Golden syrup, heated
      1    Egg, beaten
           Plain flour for dusting
           DECORATION
      9 oz Packet coloured fondant
           Icing
           Glace icing made with 2oz
           Icing sugar & 2 tspn water
           Icing sugar for rolling
           Silver balls, sweets,
           Desiccated coconut, gold
           Thread
 
  Preheat oven to 190'C (375'F). Grease two baking sheets. Sift the
  flour, bicarbonate of soda and spice into a bowl. Rub the butter into
  the flour until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the
  sugar. Add the golden syrup and egg and mix to form a dough. Gently
  knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth, the roll out to
  1/4 inch thick. Use christmas cutters to cut out 16 shapes. Lift
  shapes on to baking sheets and bake until just firm to the touch.
  Make a hole large enough for gold thread at the top of each biscuit.
  Transfer to cooling rack and leave until cold. To decorate, roll out
  fondant icing on a clean surface dusted with icing sugar. Cut out
  shapes with cutters and place on biscuits, securing them with a
  little water. Make a hole for thread as before. Decorate with piped
  glace icing, silver balls, sweets or coconut. Thread each biscuit
  with gold thread and hang on Christmas tree, if liked.

      Title: CHRISTMAS/THANKSGIVING STUFFING
 Categories: Entrees, Holiday
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/2 lb Beef, ground
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  White rice, raw
      1    Poultry liver
           -(from the bird you
           -are going to stuff)
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
    1/2 c  Almonds (blanched),
           -whole
     10    Prunes, pitted
    1/2 c  Raisins
     10    Chestnuts (up to 15)
 
  Cook the chestnuts:  Cut a groove on each chestnut and roast them on
  the stove (if you've got an electric stove, placing the chestnuts on
  the burner will do the trick, though you'll have to do some cleaning
  afterwards.) When they're done, peel them. Watch your hands.
  
  Brown the beef with half the butter.  Add the rice, salt and a little
  water, and let it cook on low heat, until the water is absorbed.
  
  Boil the liver, mince it and add it into the rice and meat. Add the
  almonds, prunes, raisins, chestnuts (cut in chunks) and pine nuts.
  Add a small amount of water and let everything simmer until the water
  is absorbed.
  
  The stuffing is ready to use.  Add the remaining butter and bake it. I
  usually wrap the stuffing in aluminum foil, put it in a separate pan
  and bake it along with the chicken. When the chicken is ready, the
  stuffing is ready too!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Holiday stuffing with fruit and nuts -- This is an elaborate
  version of the type of poultry stuffing made in Greece. People there
  have never heard of bread stuffings and, once you taste this recipe,
  you'll never want to hear about bread stuffings either! I got the
  recipe from my mother, who got it from a friend, who got it from her
  sister-in-law, who... Yield: stuffs 5-6 lb poultry.
  
  *  If the chestnut-roasting procedure is to messy for you, then just
  boil them.
  
  *  The amounts in the ingredients list are there for completeness'
  sake. You should really interpret them as a few, a handful or one
  small package. The only thing you have to bear in mind is that
  putting more prunes will make the stuffing sourer, and putting more
  raisins will make it sweeter.
  
  *  The original recipe suggested using unpitted prunes. I believe that
  using pitted prunes is safer for the teeth!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 1-2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      1 tb Freshly ground coriander
      2 ts Freshly ground cloves
      3    Oranges

  2 1/2 c  Dried currants
      1 c  Golden raisins
      1 c  Olive oil, mild

MMMMM-----------------------STARTER DOUGH----------------------------
      4 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  -Hot water, just above body
           - temperature
      4 c  All-purpose flour;
           -plus extra for kneading
 
  Make the flavoring addition first.  Combine the semolina flour, sugar,
  cinnamon, anise, coriander, and cloves in a bowl and add the finely
  grated zests of the oranges and tangerines. Squeeze some of the
  oranges and tangerines.  Squeeze some of the oranges and tangerines
  to obtain 1 1/4 cups juice.  Use half this juice to soak the currants
  and raisins for a minimum of 1 hour, preferably overnight.  Put the
  remaining juice in a pan with the olive oil.  Heat until almost
  boiling. Pour this into a bowl with the semolina and spice mixture
  and stir. Cover and leave overnight until needed. Next day, combine
  the dried yeast with the sugar and hot water in a cup. Put the flour
  in a bowl, making a well in the center. Pour in the yeast mixture.
  Squeeze 2/3 cup more orange and tangerine juice, warm it, nad add.
  Work to a smooth dough, adding more water and warm juice if
  necessary.  Put the dough into an oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and
  leave to rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size - about an
  hour. Punch down the dough in a bowl.  Combine the drained currants
  and raisins with the semolina and spice mixture and, working with
  your hands, combine with the dough.  Turn the dough onto a floured
  surface and knead for 10 minutes, adding more flour if the dough is
  sticky. Divide the dough into three equal pieces.  Oil 3 loaf pans,
  each 1-1/2 quart capacity. Shape each piece to fit the length of the
  pan and fit them in, so the corners are well filled. Cover with a
  cloth and leave to rise in a warm place until almost double in size -
  another hour. Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F for 1 hour and 10
  minutes or more; the loaves should be rich brown color and make a
  hollow sound when the unmolded bread is thumped on the bottom. Leave
  on a rack to cool.  The bread will keep for at least 3 weeks.

      1 c  Powdered sugar
      1 tb Milk or eggnog; up to 1.5 Tb

           Cinnamon red hot candies
 
  1.  Place  dough ingredients in bread pan, select Dough setting, and
  press Start.
  
  2.  When the dough has risen long enough, the machine will beep. Turn
  off bread machine, remove bread pan, and turn out dough onto a
  lightly floured countertop or cutting board. Gently roll and stretch
  dough into an 18-inch rope.  Grease a large baking sheet(s).
  
  With a sharp knife, divide the dough into 17 pieces. Roll each piece
  into a ball and place it on the greased baking sheet in the shape of
  a Christmas tree, spaced about a half-inch apart; 5 balls for the
  bottom roll, 4 balls for the next row, 3 balls for the next row, 2
  balls for the next row, and 1 ball at the top. Combine the remaining
  2 balls into 1 large ball, gently roll it into a thick rope and shape
  it into an "S" to form the tree trunk.
  
  VARIATION:  This recipe makes one large Christmas tree coffee cake. To
  create 2, 4, or 6 smaller trees, simply divide the dough into 2, 4,
  or 6 pieces initially and then follow the directions for dividing up
  the dough and shaping each tree.
  
  3.  Cover and let rise in a warm oven for 30 to 45 minutes until
  doubled. (Hint:  To warm oven slightly, turn oven on Warm setting for
  1 minute, then turn it off, and place covered dough in oven to rise.
  Remove from oven to preheat.)  Remove baking sheet(s) from oven.
  Preheat oven to 375 F.
  
  4.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown.  Cool on a cake rack.
  
  5.  When the coffee cake(s) is cooled, in a small bowl, combine the
  icing ingredients, adding enough liquid to make the icing thin enough
  to spread over the coffee cake. Spread each roll with icing, then
  decorate with cinnamon red hot candies.

  Joyce's Notes:  For a cinnamon nut coffee cake, I added 1 tsp. of
  cinnamon and about 1/2 cups chopped pecans. Good!! I also made 2
  trees by dividing the dough in half, then making 12 balls, using 10
  for the tree and 2 for the trunk.

 Categories: Polish, Cookies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      9    Egg yolks
      3 tb Sour cream
      1 tb Rum
      1 ts Vanilla
      1    Confectioners sugar
      3 c  Flour (sifted)
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 tb Sugar
      1    Oil for deep frying
 
  Beat the egg yolks with the sugar until well combined. Add sour
  cream, rum and vanilla and mix until smooth. Sift the flour, baking
  powder and salt and add it to egg yolk mixture, a little at a time.
  On a heavily floured surface knead the dough vigorously, punching and
  squeezing as much flour into it as it will take until the dough is no
  longer sticky (1/2 hour). Separate dough into several portions and
  roll very thin. Turn the dough and loosen often when rolling. The
  dough should look like parchment paper that you can see through. Cut
  dough into strips approx. 1 1/2 inches wide, 4 inches long. Make slit
  closer to one end and bring the longer end through the slit. Heat oil
  to 375 degrees and fry quickly (only a few seconds) until golden not
  brown. Turn only once. Drain on paper towels. Dust with confectioners
  sugar. Makes
        8    dozen.

  dough will still be slightly sticky.
  
  Transfer to a clean mixing bowl, cover and set aside until doubled in
  size.
  
  Turn out dough on lightly-floured work surface and punch down with
  floured hands. Knead briefly and divide in two. Roll each half into a
  log about 3 inches in diameter; cut each into 12 rolls. Using palm of
  your hand roll each piece of dough into a small, tight round roll.
  Place rolls, about 2 inches apart, on a cornmeal-dusted baking sheet.
  Cover and set aside to rise, until barely doubled. Preheat oven to
  450 degrees. Bake for 30 minutes. For crusty rolls, spray walls of
  oven with water with a plant mister.

      Title: CHUCK'S BARLEY-MUSHROOM WINTER BORSCHT (VEGAN
 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Barley
    1/2 c  Mixed baby lima beans, split
           Peas, brown lentils
      1 tb Olive oil
      6 c  Water
      2 tb Miso
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      5    To 6 turnips, peeled and
           Cubed (or 2 parsnips, or 2
           Potatoes)
      2    Carrots, sliced about 1/2"
           Thick
    1/2    To 3/4 pound mushrooms,
           Sliced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Pepper (or to taste)
      2 ts Marjoram
      1 ts Rosemary
    1/3 c  Tamari
      3 tb Unsalted butter (or magarine
           For vegan)
 
  Saute the garlic and onion in olive oil on medium heat until the
  onions are translucent. Combine the barley, lima beans, split peas,
  lentils, miso, and water with the onion/garlic, and bring to a boil.
  Add the turnips and carrots, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer
  for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
  
  ("But grandma, where did they get miso in the Ukraine?" "Shut up and
  eat your soup.")
  
  (If you have broccoli stems, peel and slice them and add them at this
  point.  I also snagged about 1 cup of shredded/sliced cabbage from
  the main dish, and added about 1/2 hour before the soup was done).
  
  Add the mushrooms, spices and tamari and continue cooking on a low
  heat for another hour.  Add the butter or margarine, let sit for a
  few minutes, and serve.  If cooking the night before, you might want
  to add 1 cup of water and heat again just before serving; the barley
  tends to absorb water, and if you omit this extra water you end up
  with a tasty gruel.
  
  The butter can be omitted, but it makes for a heartier soup.

  a coarse slaw. Check the refrigerator for odds and ends.You might add
  some apple; a leek instead of the spring onion. Skip the tomatoand
  add red bell pepper for color. Crunchy jicama or the bite of a radish
  ~- be creative. 4> Mix the spices together in a separate bowl and
  toss HALF the blend with the vegetable slaw. Add the rice and beans
  to this mixture and stir to blend. Taste, adjust with salt and
  pepper. 5> Prepare an oblong baking pan (line with foil, or spray).
  Mound the stuffing into each zucchini "boat." Extra stuffing can be
  scattered between the boats; this 'extra' may needwater during
  baking. Sprinkle with grated cheese. Sprinkle top with the remaining
  HALF of the spices (a sifter works well).
  
  BAKE 350F for 30 minutes.  Turn off heat and cover. Go to the party.
  Keep it warm but don't overcook: the big zucchini is hollowed out yet
  what pulp remains should be firm.
  
  Pat's note:  I think the foil was necessary not just to keep the dish
  warm but to retain moisture.

      Title: CHUCK-WAGON BEAN POT
 Categories: Crockpot, Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Bean (any variety), dry
      1    Ham hock or shank
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      6 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
      7 oz Green chili salsa
           -(up to 10 oz; or use
           -tomato sauce, canned
           -or stewed tomatoes)
 
  Rinse the beans and remove any foreign matter.  Mix all ingredients
  in the cooking vessel.
  
  IF USING A SLOW-COOKER:  Cover, set temperature at low, and forget
  for at least 10 hours.  If you have only half a day, cook the mixture
  5 or more hours on high.
  
  IF USING A STOVE:  Heat all ingredients to boiling with pot
  uncovered. Turn down heat, cover, and simmer gently, adding enough
  boiling water to keep beans well covered. Most bean varieties will be
  done in 2 to 3 hours.
  
  When beans are done, take out ham bone, cut off the meat and put it
  back into the pot. Serve hot with corn bread or muffins. Green chili
  salsa is a Mexican sauce made from green chili peppers, onions,
  vinegar and other ingredients.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Hearty Bean Stew -- I got this recipe from "A Primer on Bean
  Cookery" by the California Dry Bean Advisory Board and other
  organizations. This savory stew, featuring ham and beans, borrows its
  robust seasonings from the chuck wagon cooks of the old western
  cattle ranges. The secret is long, slow cooking, and your electric
  slow-cooker is ideal for the job. Just follow the directions that
  come with your particular model. If you don't have one, slow-cook the
  mixture on top of the stove in a heavy pot with a lid.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, many hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHUNKY GRANOLA (WITH NO OIL ADDED)
 Categories: Breakfast, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8 c  Rolled oats
      1 c  Nuts (more if desired,
           -- up to double this amount)
    1/2 c  Sunflower seeds
    1/2 c  Whole millet
           -OR- whole buckwheat groats
      3 c  Whole wheat flour (or more)
           -OR- part cornmeal,
           - rice flour,
           - or other whole-grain flour
      1 ts Salt (or more, as desired)
    1/2 c  Honey (or more,
           -- up to double this amount)
      1 c  -Hot water, or up to:
      2 c  -Hot water *
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  * Note: More water makes the granola chunkier, less makes it crumbly.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  In a large bowl or pot, combine oats, nuts,
  seeds, millet, flour, and salt. Mix together honey, water, and
  vanilla, and stir into dry ingredients. Spread on a lightly oiled
  baking sheet and squeeze mixture together to form small chunks, but
  don't crowd; the chunks need to bake clear through. Roast until
  golden brown, about 10 to 20 minutes. (With the larger amount of
  water, reduce heat and bake longer.) As it bakes the granola may need
  stirring to brown evenly. Cool thoroughly before storing.
  
  Variations:  Replace part of the water with the freshly squeezed
  juice of 2 oranges (and add the grated rinds if the oranges were not
  sprayed with pesticides), or use 2 teaspoons orange oil.
  
  For "gingerbread" granola, use half molasses (for half honey) and add
  2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ginger and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.
  
  For a nice change, substitute maple syrup for honey.

      Title: CHUNKY MUSTARD BEANS WITH RED PEPPERS
 Categories: Pickles, Beans
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Green and/or yellow beans
      2 c  Julienne strips of red
           -peppers (sweet)
  1 1/2 c  Onions, coarsely chopped
      1 ts Tumeric
    1/3 c  Dry mustard
    1/3 c  All purpose flour
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/3 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
      1 c  Cold water
      2 c  White or cider vinegar
      1 tb Celery seeds
  1 1/2 ts Mustard seeds
 
  Remove stem end from beans; cut beans into 1 inch lengths. There
  should be about 8 cups. In a large pot of rapidly boiling water, cook
  beans, about 1/3 at a time, until tender-crunchy, about 3 minutes. As
  each batch cooks, transfer immediately to large bowl of cold water to
  chill. Blanch peppers and onions in similar way, boiling peppers for
  1 minute and onions for 2 minutes.  Drain thoroughly. In a medium
  bowl, blend tumeric, mustard, flour and salt into sugar. Stir in cold
  water to make a smooth paste. In a large heavy preserving kettle,
  combine vinegar and celery and mustard seeds; bring to boil. Stir in
  about 1 cup of spiced vinegar into mustard paste, then whisk mustard
  past into spiced vinegar in saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking
  constantly until sauce is smooth. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered,
  for 5 minutes. Pour drained vegetables into sauce; mix well and
  return to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 4 - 5 minutes or until
  vegetables are tender.  Ladle into hot sterilized jars leaving 1/8
  inch head space. Seal. I prefer to process these in a boiling water
  bath for 10 minutes for 1/2 pint jars and 15 minutes for pint jars.
  Makes about 9 cups.

 Categories: Breads, Dumplings
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 tb Sugar
  2 1/4 c  Water -- lukewarm
      6 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter -- melted
      1 tb Salt
      2 tb White sesame seeds
 
  Sprinkle the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar into 1/2 cup of
  lukewarm (110-115F) water in a small, shallow bowl. Let stand for 2
  or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast completely. Set the
  bowl aside in a warm, draft-free spot (such as an unlighted oven) for
  about 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture almost doubles in volume.
  
  Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the
  center. Pour in the yeast mixture, remaining water, remaining sugar
  and salt. With a large spoon beat the flour into the liquid
  ingredients, continuing to beat for as long as 10 minutes, or until a
  soft, spongy dough is formed. Cover loosely with a kitchen towel and
  set aside in the warm, draft-free spot until the mixture doubles in
  volume.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Place the dough on a lightly floured
  surface and divide it into 10 equal parts. Roll each part out as
  thinly as possible into circles, then place 2 or 3 circles on a
  cookie sheet. Sprinkle lightly with cold water and a few sesame seeds
  and set the cookie sheet on the floor of the oven. Bake for 20
  minutes, or until the bread is a pale golden brown.  Transfer the
  breads with a wide spatula to a wire cake rack and bake the remaining
  rounds similarly. The bread will keep several days at room
  temperature if wrapped securely in foil.

  *Buy a heavy coconut that has no cracks and that sounds full of
  liquid when shaken.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 F.
  
  After draining liquid from coconut, bake until shell begins to crack,
  about 30 minutes. Tap coconut shell with hammer to remove shell. (The
  white meat with its brown skin should fall away from shell; if it
  doesn't, use paring knife to release meat.) Using paring knife, cut
  away brown skin from coconut, if desired. Rinse coconut. Coarsely
  chop in processor to measure 3/4 cup (reserve remaining coconut for
  another use).
  
  Heat small skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds; stir until
  fragrant, about 3 minutes (do not burn). Transfer seeds to plate;
  cool. Finely grind seeds in spice grinder or in mortar with pestle.
  
  Core apples; cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Place apples in medium bowl.
  Add lemon juice and toss to coat. Combine 3/4 cup coconut, cumin,
  apples and all remaining ingredients in processor. Chop finely.
  
  (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room
  temperature before using.)

      Title: CHUTNEY IN THE RAW
 Categories: Condiments
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lb Dates (stoneless)
      1 lb Apples
      1 lb Sultanas
      1 lb Brown sugar
  2 1/2 c  Vinegar
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 tb Pickling spices,
           -tied in a muslin bag
        sm Ginger piece
 
  Mince the dates, apples and onions and place in a large pan. Add the
  sultanas and stir in the sugar.
  
  Add all the other ingredients and stir well, but make sure the bag of
  spices and the ginger are identifiable. Leave for 24 hours but stir
  occasionally (once every 4 hours or so).
  
  Remove the bag of spices and ginger.  Bottle and store in a coolish
  place. Eat.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An easy chutney with no cooking -- This recipe filtered down to me
  through a grapevine of neighbours. You will need a supply of jam-jars,
  jam-jar covers and a large pan to keep the ingredients in. Yield:
  Makes several jars.
  
  *  I sometimes use currents in place of the stoneless dates, in which
  case you don't need to mince them. If the mixture appears too liquid
  after the 24 hour standing time, it is worth draining off some of the
  vinegar before bottling.
  
  *  The beauty of this recipe is that you don't have a vast pot of
  strange things bubbling away on the stove for hours. A big win!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  25 minutes preparation, 24 hours standing time.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK, but don't go overboard with
  the vinegar.

      Title: CIDER MARINATED BEEF ROAST
 Categories: Beef, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 lb Boneless rump, sirloin tip
      2 c  Apple cider
    2/3 c  Salad oil
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      3    Cloves garlic, smashed
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Thyme
      1 ts Mustard, dry
      1 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Black pepper, fresh ground
      2 tb Cornstarch
 
  Here's  a boneless beef roast marinated in a flavorful apple-cider,
  onion- garlick mixture.  Surprisingly good. The meat must be cooked
  to RARE or MEDIUM-RARE for its optimum tenderness, which may be bad
  news for those of you who like it well-done, but well-done, in this
  case, will prove to be tougher than the medium-rare. The acidic
  action of the cider makes all the difference in  the world in terms
  of tenderness. Combine that with the marinating and the slow
  roasting, tenderness IS the name of the game. You can garnish this
  one with crab apples and parsley for making pretty. Directions for
  beef roast: Make a couple of dozen slits in the meat on the outside
  about an inch deep. Place in a glass or plastic bowl. Combine the
  apple cider, oil, lemon juice, onion, garlick, bay leaf, salt, thyme,
  allspice, mustard and pepper; pour the marinade over the meat. Cover
  and marinate in the refrigerator at least four hours. Maybe more.
  Remove the roast from the marinade. Place on a roasting pan and
  insert the meat thermometer so it reaches the thickest part. Roast at
  300 degrees until the thermometer reaches 140 degrees, about 2 hours
  for rare meat (meat continues to cook after it is out of the oven).
  Remove onto a warm platter. Strain the marinade.   Skim the fat from
  the roasting pan, and add the marinade to the drippings.   Reserve 2
  to 3 tbsp of the marinade liquid to mix with the cornstarch. Stir the
  cornstarch into the boiling liquid and cook until thickend.
   Glaze the roast with the sauce.    Slice  *very thinly* to serve.
  Especially  good served with potato casserole (or the new
  potato-garlick recipe you just saw posted here), glazed carrots,
  green salad, garlick bread.

      Title: CILANTRO PESTO - RAHK PAHK CHEE-GRATIEM-PRIK
 Categories: Thai, Condiments
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 ts Whole White Or Black
           Peppercorns
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Fresh
           Cilantro Roots Or Leaves
           And Stems
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Garlic
 
  CILANTRO PESTO:  Using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, crush
  or grind the peppercorns to a fine powder. Combine the pepper,
  cilantro roots and garlic; work the three ingredients into a fairly
  smooth paste in the mortar or in a small blender or food processor.
  If you use a blender or food processor, you may need to add a little
  vegetable oil or water to ease the grinding.  Make about 1/4 cup. For
  an industrial strength batch use 1 tb peppercorns, 1/2 cup cilantro
  roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the pesto for later use, put in a
  glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface to cover it and seal
  tightly. It will keep nicely for about 1 week in the refrigerator.

      6 lb Veal, breast, trimmed,
           -- boned, butterflied
      5 lg Eggs, hard cooked,peeled

MMMMM----------------------POACHING LIQUID---------------------------
    1/4 c  Salt, coarse (about)
      1 md Onion, sliced
      1 lg Carrot, sliced
      3 ea Bay leaves
 
       ** See other recipes for Cima alla Genovese Stuffing and Cima
  alla Genovese Salsa Verde.
  
       Spread half of the cooled stuffing down the length of the veal
  breast, leaving a 2 1/2 inch border on the long sides. Press the
  stuffing together compactly.  Lay 5 hard cooked eggs end to end down
  the length of the stuffing.  Spoon the remaining stuffing over eggs,
  pressing it compactly with your hands into a high, narrow shape. When
  the meat is rolled later, the eggs should be in approximately the
  center of the roll.
  
       Pull a needle with twine through a hole in the center of one
  short end of the veal.  Gather together the 2 corners of this short
  end and sew the end together, stitching from the inside outward at 1
  inch intervals. Now stitch together both long sides of the veal
  breast, gathering them together and pushing the stuffing in as you
  stitch at 1 inch intervals. Sew together other short end, tying a
  knot as you sew it shut. Cut off the string, leaving about 4 inches
  at the end.
  
       Lay a large sheet of cheesecloth (about 2 x 3 feet) next to
  stuffed veal breast.  Without picking up breast, flip it over
  carefully onto the center of the cheesecloth. Fold one long side of
  cheesecloth over the length of the breast, wrapping it firmly, but
  not tightly. Then fold the short ends up, and finally the second long
  side.
  
       Wrap some twine around the length of the breast 3 or 4 times,
  then bring the twine around the breast crosswise in a spiral at 1 1/2
  inch intervals.  Tie the twine at one end of the breast.
  
  To Poach:
  
       Choose a deep pot large enough to hold the veal and half fill it
  with cold water.  Add about 1/4 cup coarse salt, sliced onion, sliced
  carrot, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Lower heat, and add veal. If
  necessary, add additional water to cover.  Place a lid on the veal
  breast to keep it submerged.  Simmer 1 hour and 45 minutes.
  
       When veal is cooked, transfer it to a roasting pan. Cover with
  second pan and weight it down to compact the roll. Cool to lukewarm
  or room temperature, 2 to 3 hours.
  
       When veal is cool, remove outer twine and cheesecloth. Cut off
  the one knotted end of twine, and starting at other end, very
  carefully pull out stitching and discard.  Trim off excess fat,
  without cutting into the filling.
  
       Cut into thick slices and serve with salsa verde. (Unused
  portions may be refrigerated and served cold.)

       Because Cima alla Genovese has so many ingredients and direction
  lines, I've had to split it up into three different recipes for
  import. This is one of my favorite recipes for impressing guests
  because it is relatively easy, yet it looks so tempting difficult to
  do.
  
       Please be sure to collect all three recipes before you begin
  cooking or you'll be sorely disappointed.... <smiling>:

  the meat to the skillet. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook,
  stirring occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned. Stir in all
  the remaining ingredients up through the water. Taste and adjust
  seasonings. If the flavor is too sweet, add a small amount of
  vinegar; if not spicy enough, add a small amount of ground chile.
  Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer,
  uncovered, for 2 to 4 hours. Add the kidney beans to the mixture 1/2
  hour before serving. Place a small amount of the cooked vermicelli in
  individual bowls. Spoon on a generous amount of chili. Top with

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------PART TWO-------------------------------
      8 oz Thick spaghetti
     16 oz Can red kidney beans
      2 x  Onions, chpd
      1 lb Wisconsin cheddar,fine grate
 
  The bottom layer is always spaghetti, the thickest you can find. If
  you have trouble, try using long, thin macaroni like perciatelli.
  Break into 4" pieces, boil in salted water to which oil has been
  added. For a touch o swank, melt a stick of sweet butter into the
  just-cooked noodles before you dish them out. You will need about
  2-3oz per serving. You want them soft enough to cut easily with a
  fork, but not so soft they lose their oomph. Remember, they are the
  support layer for four other ingredients. Spread them out to cover
  the bottom of a small oval plate. Ladle on the chili, enough to cover
  the noodles. Wash kidney beans and heat with 2c water, then drain.
  Spoon a sparce layer atop the chili. Spread onions over beans.
  Quickly (so it melts) spread cheese to cover everything. Don't skimp.
  Cheese should completely blanket the plate, enough so that you can
  pat it into a neat mound with your hands, just the way they do in
  Cincinnati. Variations: 3-Way or 4-Way: Omit either beans or onions,
  or both.

  ***Excerpt from "Square Meals": "No one who loves to eat can visit
  Cincinnati without falling in love with the most eccentric and
  delicious noodle dish of all--5-Way Chili. Invented by Greek
  immigrants in the 1920s, it is unique to southern Ohio, and served
  only in chili parlors, most of which are fluorescent-lighted
  luncheonettes that haven't changed much since 1950. Nobody in
  Cincinnati gives out their recipe. It is a dish of startling
  complexity, so dizzingly spicy..." THIS IS A 2 PART RECIPE. Salt a
  large cast iron skillet. Turn heat to med and add meat, onions, and
  garlic. Cook until meat is browned. Add tomato sauce, catsup, water,
  and vinegar. As mixture begins to boil, add everything else. Adjust
  spices to taste, adding more salt if it needs perking up, turmeric
  and cumin for a sweatier chili flavor, cinnamon, cloves, and mace if
  you want it sweeter, cardamom for more bang, unsweetened chocolate
  for body. Cover and simmer at very low heat for about 1 hr, stirring
  and tasting occasionally, adding tomato juice if it is getting too
  dry to ladle up easily.

  Cincinnati Chili, Construction
  
        8 oz Spaghetti
       16 oz Kidney Beans 2 Onions
        1 lb Cheddar Cheese 1 Box Crackers Premium Bits
  
  The bottom layer is always spaghetti. Break into 4-inch pieces. and
  boil in salted water to which 2 tablespoons of olive oil were added.
  For a touch of swank, melt a stick of sweet butter into the
  just-cooked noodles before you dish them out.
  
  You will need about 2 to 3 ounces per serving. You want them soft
  enough to cut easily with a fork, but not so soft they lose their
  oomph. Remember, they are the support layer for four other
  ingredients. Spread them out to cover the bottom of a small plate
  (preferably oval).
  
  Next comes the chili. Ladle on enough to cover the noodles. Wash
  kidney beans and heat with 2 cups water, then drain. Don't season or
  do anything fancy. They're here more for texture than taste. Spoon a
  sparse layer atop the chili.
  
  Spread out some onions, to taste, over the beans.
  
  Quickly, so it melts a bit, spread the grated cheese to cover
  everything everything. Don't skimp. Cheese should completely blanket
  the plate, enough so that you can pat it into a neat mound with your
  hands, just the way they do in Cincinnati.
  
  Serve with small oyster crackers (if you can find them) or the Ritz
  bits on the side.
  
  You may, if desired, omit either the beans or the onions, or both, for
  Three-Way or Four-Way Chili.
  
  Note: They recommend using a thick spaghetti, or perciatelli, if you
  can find it.

           Buttered
     16 oz Can kidney beans
      1 lb Cheddar cheese, finely
           Shredded
 
  Brown the meat with half the chopped onion and garlic, stirring to
  keep it loose. (Set the remaining onion aside to top the chili when
  its done). Drain any fat from the pan. Add barbecue sauce & water &
  bring the pan to a boil. Simmer 30 min. stirring occasionally. The
  chili will thicken as it cooks. Add tomatoe juice as necessary to
  create a brew that ladles up easily. Allow the chili to rest at least
  30 min in a covered pan at room temperature. (Chili can be
  refrigerated & reheated to serve.) To make eash plate, start with a
  layer of spaghetti & top it with hot chili, then a few beans, then
  the reserved onions to taste. Pat on the cheese so the chili's heat
  can begin to melt it. Serve immediately with oyster crackers.
  
  I add the kidney beans just before the chili is finished cooking
  instead of adding as a layer at serving time.

      1 lb Cream cheese
      2 tb Milk
      1 c  Tomato Salsa Cruda
      1 c  Cilantro Pesto
      1 c  Avocado Salsa
 
  To prepare the Cinco de Mayo Spread, select a springform pan or
  straightsided dish that is 5 to 6 inches in diameter and 2 inches
  deep. Line the bottom and sides with plastic wrap, smoothing out the
  plastic as much as possible.
  
  Beat half the cream cheese with the milk, so it is easily spreadable.
  Spread this mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan. Chill for 30
  minutes. Spread the Cilantro Pesto evenly over the cream cheese and
  chill. Beat the remaining cream cheese with the Tomato Salsa Cruda
  and carefully spread it over the Cilantro Pesto. Chill for at least 4
  hours. Place a serving platter on top of the springform pan and,
  holding the dishes with both hands, flip them over. Remove the
  springform ring and bottom. Gently pull the plastic wrap off. Just
  before serving, spoon the Avocado Salsa over the top of the spread.

      Title: CINDA (AND WHOEVER ELSE'S) PEANUT BUTTER COOK
 Categories: Cookies, Nuts
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 c  Peanut butter
      1 c  White or (firmly packed)
           Brown sugar
      1    Egg
      1    Bag Hershey's kisses, opt'l
 
  (the brown sugar version is best, IMHO)
  
  Since you like peanut butter and chocolate, here's one for you that
  shouldn't challenge your abilities too much. The original recipe for
  this came from my sister-in-law (the overworked mother of 5 boys) who
  got it from a neighbor when she lived in Alaska. Another version was
  posted here a couple of years ago by someone (can't recall who), and
  I've posted it several times since, but just in case you missed it....
  
  Mix the peanut butter, sugar and egg together.  Roll into balls the
  size of large marbles, place on a cookie sheet, and either flatten
  with a fork or flatten by pressing a kiss in the center.
  
  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until the edges just start to
  brown.
  
  NOTE:  This is NOT a misprint.  There is NO FLOUR or anything else in
  this recipe, just the peanut butter, egg and sugar. It seems as if it
  would be a dreadful mess, but the result is a very good cookie.

      Title: CINNABON CINNAMON ROLLS
 Categories: Breads, Desserts, Breadmaker
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      4 tb Melted butter
      4 tb Water
    1/2    Box instant vanilla pudding
           -(1/2 of a 3.4oz. box)
      1 c  Milk
      1    Egg; (beaten)
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      4 c  Bread flour
  2 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
           -Fill with:
    1/2 c  Softened butter
      1 c  Brown sugar
      2 ts Cinnamon
 
  ROLLS: Place ingredients in machine following the specifications of
  that particular machine.  Set for dough cycle (about 1 hr. 40 minutes
  in my Hitachi B101 ~ Debbie Carlson). After complete on dough cycle,
  remove from machine & roll out to 17 x 10 (approx) rectangle.
  
  FILLING: Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread softened
  butter over dough. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over
  top. Roll tightly from long end, pinching edges closed when
  completely rolled. Slice rolled dough into 1/2" slices (or larger if
  a larger bun is preferred ).Place into greased cake pans. ( I use 3 -
  9" pans ) I usually get 19 - 20 buns from this. Let rise until
  doubled. Bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes, until golden. Do not
  overbake. FROST with: 4 oz cream cheese (softened) 1/4 C butter
  (softened) 1 1/2 C confectioners sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla 1 1/2 tsp milk
  
  SPREAD on very warm rolls.  They are best when eaten fresh, but we
  have found that 10 - 15 seconds in the microwave rejuvenates them!
  
  Note:  I made these in my Hitachi B101 and the dough turned out
  beautifully!  I added chopped nuts to the filling though and doubled
  the cinnamon.  I also sliced my rolls about 1" and placed them in a
  non-stick 13x9" baking pan which rendered about 10 large rolls. Also,
  because I don't care for a cream cheese frosting, I used 3 cups
  powdered sugar, 4 Tbsp. softened butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and about 3
  Tbsp. milk which made lots of frosting, perhaps too much. (Debbie

  colander (but don't let them dry out, they should be damp).
  
  Sift together the powdered sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon and salt, three
  times.  Coat the almonds iwth the cinnamon-sugar mixture. An easy way
  to do this is to place the sifted cinnamon mixture into a small paper
  bag and drop inthe almonds, a few at at ime, hold bag closed and
  remove from bag with a slottted spoon, place on cookie sheet,
  continuing until all almonds are coated.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -DOUGH:
      1 pk Active Dry Yeast
  2 1/4 c  Bread Flour
      2 tb Brown Sugar
      1 tb Dry Milk Powder
      1 ts Cinnamon, Ground
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Water
           -SWIRL FILLING:
      1    Apple, Peeled, Cored & 1/4"
           -Diced
      3 tb Brown Sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 tb All Purpose Flour
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
 
  All ingredients should be at room temperature before starting. Add
  all the dough ingredients to the pan in the order listed. Select
  "White Bread". Press "Start".
  
  Let the machine run all the way through the end of final kneading.
  During the final knead, prepare a work area in which the dough will
  be rolled out.
  
  Combine and thoroughly blend the spiral filling ingredients.
  
  After the machine stops kneading for the final time, remove the bread
  pan with the dough in it.
  
  PERSONAL NOTE: (this part depends on the machine you are using. -
  with my Hitachi if I remove the bread pan the machine automatically
  goes back to zero on the timer - what I do is just take the dough out
  of the pan and leave the pan in place)
  
  Working quickly, turn the dough out onto a well floured work area.
  Roll the dough out to form a long but narrow (about half as wide as
  the bread pan is tall) oblong of dough about  1/2" thick. Spread the
  spiral filling ingredients over the top of the dough oblong. Roll the
  dough up jelly-roll fashion. Return the dough cylinder to the bread
  pan. Permit the machine to complete the rise and bake cycles
  normally. ~!- Sharon Stevens

      1 ea Egg white, slightly beaten
    1/4 c  Sliced almonds
 
  Combine 1/4 cup of the water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and yeast.
  Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.
  Fit processor with steel blade. Measure flour, butter, remaining
  sugar and salt into work bowl.  Process until mixed, about 15
  seconds. Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough
  remaining water through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a
  ball that cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns
  around bowl about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1
  to 2 minutes. Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough
  remaining water to make dough soft, smooth and satiny, but not
  sticky.  Process until dough turns around bowl about 15 times. Turn
  dough onto lightly greased surface.  Cover with inverted bowl and let
  stand 20 minutes. Prepare Cinnamon Sugar while dough is standing.
  Roll out dough into a 9 x 15-inch rectangle.  Cut into three 3 x
  15-inch strips. Spoon 1/3 of Cinnamon Sugar lengthwise down center of
  each strip. Pull one edge of each strip over Cinnamon sugar to meet
  other edge of same strip. Pinch seam to seal. Braid the strips
  together to form a loaf. Tuck ends under and pinch to seal.  Place
  braid on greased cookie sheet. Brush with beaten egg white and
  sprinkle with almonds. Let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1
  hour. Heat oven to 375 F.  Bake until evenly brown and loaf sounds

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  1 1/3 c  Lukewarm water
      1 ts Honey
      3 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 tb Active dry yeast

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Smooth natural peanut butter
    1/4 c  Honey
    1/2 c  Unsweetened applesauce
      2 tb Cinnamon
      2 tb Water
    2/3 c  Raisins
 
  Combine the water, honey, and yeast in a large bowl. Let sit for 5
  minutes until foamy.  Add the flour 1 cup at a time, beating well
  after each addition.  When the dough becomes to stiff to mix, turn it
  out onto a floured board and knead for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth
  and elastic. Put it in a very lightly oiled bowl, cover, and allow to
  rise for 1 hour. <If a very light dough is desired, you may punch it
  down, cover, and allow to rise another 40 to 45 minutes) While the
  dough is rising, combine the peanut butter and honey in a saucepan
  and mix over low heat until easily blended (or warm in microwave
  until easily blended). Beat in all the remaining ingredients except
  the raisins. Remove the risen dough from the bowl and knead about ten
  times on a clean board. Roll out into a large rectangle about 15" X
  14". Spread with filling to 1/2" of the edge. sprinkle raisins evenly
  over the filling. Roll the rectangle into a log, starting at the
  15-in side, pinch the edges to seal, and slice into 1" thick rounds.
  <They will be VERY gooey> Place on a nonstick baking sheet, cover,
  and allow to rise for about 20 minutes, or until light. Bake in a
  preheated 350 F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown on top.

      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
    3/4 c  Milk
      3 tb Melted butter
    1/2 c  Firmly packed dark brown sug
    3/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans
 
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 450F. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt
  in a large mixing bowl. Cut in the vegetable shortening using a
  pastry blender or two knives until the mixture has the consistency of
  coarse crumbs. Add the milk, adding more milk if necessary so the
  dough is pliable but is still wet. Turn the dough onto a heavily
  floured surface, and knead it lightly (8 to 10 times). Do not
  overwork the dough. Roll the dough into a rectangle 1/3-inch thick.
  Mix the melted butter with the brown sugar, cinnamon and nuts. Press
  the mixture into one half of the dough, then fold the dough over to
  encase the filling, pressing it lightly to adhere. Cut out biscuits
  with a 2-inch round cutter (the diameter of a juice can), dipping the
  cutter in flour between cutting each biscuit so they do not stick.
  Place the biscuits on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake in the
  center of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve
  immediately, or bake up to 2 hours in advance and reheat for 5
  minutes in a 300F oven. Makes 12 to 14. These biscuits are delicious
  served warm with sweet butter or apple butter.

 Categories: Misc, Gifts, Apples
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 cn Cinnamon
      1    Jar applesauce
 
  Drain the moisture from the applesauce for 10 or 15 minutes (or
  longer if necessary) by putting it in a colander or strainer which
  you've lined with a coffee filter (or something similar). Pour the
  whole container of cinammon into a bowl and add just a little
  applesauce at a time; stir; keep adding but check carefully each
  time; until you have a VERY STIFF dough. Roll out the dough between
  two sheets of waxed paper until it's around a quarter inch thick,
  then cut it with cookie cutters. Make holes in the dough cutouts with
  drinking straws. Put the cookies in a very low oven (only about
  175-200 degrees F) for several hours; watch carefully so they don't
  burn (if they start to, lower oven). Or you can air-dry them for
  several days, turning them over carefully each day. When COMPLETELY
  DRY, put ribbons thru the holes and hang on the tree. Submitted By

      Title: CINNAMON PATE (CHA QUE)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Appetizer
 
      1 lb Boneless pork (weight after
           -trimming fat), preferable
           -fresh ham
      3 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      3 tb Water
    1/2 tb Potato starch or rice flour
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
        ds MSG (optional)
           Sprinkling of freshly
           -ground black pepper
      2 oz Pork fat
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  This recipe is very tasty with an interesting texture. Unless you're
  a fan of hard work, use a food processor. The pate was originally
  pounded to the proper consistency in a mortar and pestle...  It can
  be used all sorts of ways++made into balls for soup, sliced after
  cooking and added to lettuce or rice paper rolls, served with shrimp
  chips for munchies++whatever inspires you.  The cinnamon flavor is
  discernible but not overpowering. I've actually made this recipe and
  found it to be a keeper.
  
  Be sure pork is trimmed of all fat.  Slice the meat 1/4 inch thick,
  then cut into 1 inch squares.  Make a marinade by combining all the
  remaining ingredients, except for the pork fat and cinnamon, in a
  large bowl. Add the pork slices to the marinade and mix well with
  your hands, then cover the bowl with wrap or foil. Refrigerate for 5
  hours, and after that period of time has elapsed, transfer the bowl
  to the freezer for 10 minutes.
  
  Remove the pork from the freezer, add the cinnamon, and reduce to a
  paste in a food processor only.
  
  Boil the pork fat for 10 minutes and dice into small pieces, the size
  of whole peppercorns.  Add the diced pork fat to the ground pork
  mixture.
  
  Coat an 8-inch-square baking pan with oil.  Put the meat paste into
  the pan and press down firmly with your hands, making sure the
  surface is smooth. The meat will come halfway up the side of the pan.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F and bake the pate for 40 minutes or until the
  surface looks brown.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Then
  slice and serve as an appetizer or with French bread for lunch or
  dinner, or use in any recipe where it is required.  It can be eaten
  hot or cold.
  
  This will keep fresh in the refrigerator for a week, or it can be
  stored for a longer period in the freezer. To reheat, wrap in foil
  and place in a 300F oven for 15 minutes.

  peaches, spice bundle, orange juice, lime juice, honey, cinnamon, and
  ginger in a heavy saucepan. (The amount of honey needed well depend
  on the sweetness of the peaches.) Simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until

  ***NOTE*** Do NOT replace the butter in this recipe for anything
  else. I can tell you from my experience and experimentation that the
  results are NOT the same.  It is the combination of tastes of butter,
  onions and cinnamon that make this dish.  I have even tried
  combinations of oleo and butter, and oil and butter with disastrous
  results. The frying fat MUST be pure, 100% butter. ****** Peel and
  slice potatoes. Peel and chop onions. Melt butter in a skillet. Place
  potatoes and onion in skillet. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add
  cinnamon (I used the quantity of 2 tb, this is merely a guesstimate,
  I use a VERY generous amount). Fry on medium heat, turning
  occasionally, until potatoes are tender and slightly browned. Great

      Title: CINNAMON SHORTBREADS
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 24 Pieces
 
    100 g  Plain wholewheat flour
    100 g  Plain white flour
     50 g  Cornflour
     50 g  Semolina or ground rice
      2 ts Cinnamon (or more)
    225 g  Soft butter or margarine
    100 g  Caster sugar
 
  Set the oven to 170 C (325 F, Gas Mark 3) and grease a 19 cm x 29 cm
  (7-1/2 inch x 11-1/2 inch) shallow tin with butter.
  
  Sift the flours, semolina or ground rice and cinnamon into a large
  bowl or food processor, adding the residue of bran from the sieve.
  Then put in the butter or margarine and the sugar. Whizz, or beat,
  all the ingredients together until they form a soft dough which
  leaves the sides of the bowl clean.
  
  Press this into the tin, leveling the surface by pressing with the
  back of a metal spoon.  Then prick the surface all over with a fork.
  Bake for about 45 minutes, until the shortbread is set and quite
  crispy on top and very lightly tinged with gold.  It's more tricky to
  tell when these are done than with normal shortbreads because they
  are already rather brown! If you are in doubt, you can lift up one of
  the end pieces and look underneath it to see if it looks done
  underneath. If not, carefully put it back and let the shortbread cook
  for a bit longer. When it's done, cut it into sections, if you
  haven't already done so, and leave it to cool and crisp up in the tin.
  
  This shortbread keeps well in a tin for several days, if it gets the
  chance, and also freezes well.  It defrosts very quickly; you can use
  it almost straight from the freezer.

      Yield: 1 Serves
 
      1    3 inch piece stick
           -cinnamon
      1 tb Minced, peeled fresh ginger
      2    Whole cloves
           Few gratings of nutmeg
      1 c  Vodka
    1/2 c  Brandy
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Water
 
  Prep time: 30 mins   Cook time: 0 mins   Difficulty: ** Source:
  Glorious Liqueurs Ed By Mary Aurea Morris
  
  In a glass bottle or jar, steep the cinnamon stick, minced ginger,
  cloves and nutmeg in the vodka and brandy for about 2 weeks in a
  dark, cool place, gently shaking the bottle each day.
  
  Gently pour the jar's contents through a regular strainer or sieve,
  pressing hard on the solids to release all their flavor. Follow this
  with 2 strainings through slightly damp cheesecloth. For true clarity
  and professional - looking results, pour the strained mixture through
  a large clean coffee filter placed inside a funnel or clean coffee
  cone; loosely cover the contents with plastic wrap, since the process
  may take several hours.
  
  In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a boil over
  moderately high heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Let cool to
  room temperature.
  
  Funnel the strained spice mixture into a glass bottle, then funnel in
  the sugar syrup. Cork tightly; shake to blend. Let mature at room
  temperature or slightly cooler for at least 1 week. Makes about 1
  pint.
  
  Note: The prep time does not include the 3 weeks necessary for the
  liqueur to steep and mature.

      2    Egg yolks

  1 1/2 c  Confectioners sugar
      1    Egg white
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 dr Yellow food coloring (opt.)
 
   A must on your Christmas cookie tray. Despite the lemony frosting,
  the cinnamon flavor comes through.
  
   On a pastry board, mix flour, sugar and walnuts. Form a mound, make
  a well and add the egg yolks, lemon rind and spices. Cut the butter
  in small pieces and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly to
  make a smooth dough.
  
   Let dough rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
  
   Preheat oven to 350. Roll dough out with a rolling pin to 1/8- inch
  thick and cut into star shapes with a cookie cutter. Bake at 350
  until cookies are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let cool and
  decorate with the icing.
  
   To make icing, mix sugar, egg white, lemon juice and yellow food
  coloring (if using) in a bowl until very smooth. (Icing has to be
  thick enough so it will not run off stars.) Spread evenly with a
  pointed knife on the stars. Let icing dry overnight. Store in a
  cookie tin.
  
  Note: If you like a less sweet cookie, omit the icing.

      3    Egg yolks
      2 c  Whipping cream
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      1 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla

    1/2 c  Light brown sugar, packed
    2/3 c  Flour
      1 tb Cinnamon
    1/4 c  Butter
 
   FOR THE ICE CREAM: 1.In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks until slightly

  the mixture a day ahead and refrigerate. After churning, ripen the
  ice cream in an airtight container in the freezer from 1/2 to 2 hours.
   FOR THE STREUSEL: 1.Preheat oven to 300F.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5 c  Sifted all purpose flour
      2 c  Sugar
           Salt
      3 tb Butter OR oil
      1    Active dry yeast (use 2
           Packages if time is short)
      1 c  Warm water (105 - 1150F)
      1    Egg, slightly beaten
    1/2 c  Melted butter
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Anise extract OR
    1/4 c  Aniseeds
 
     1.  Sift flour, 1 cup sugar adn salt together.  Cut in the butter
  until the mixture resembles coarse meal. If using oil, stir oil into
  liquid ingredients after adding the egg.
  
     2.  Dissolve yeast in warm water, stir vigorously, and allow to
  ferment for 5 to 10 minutes.  Then add the egg and anise extract or
  aniseeds.
  
     3.  Add a small quantity of the flour mixture to the yeast and beat
  until thoroughly blended.  Let stand for a few minutes, or until dough
  becomes light and airy.
  
     4.  Add the rest of the flour mixture, adding more flour if
  necessary to make a stiff dough.  Knead on a lightly floured board
  until satiny.
  
     5.  Butter the top of the dough, cover with wax paper and let rise
  until doubled.
  
     6.  When the bread has risen, punch it down, and let it rise until
  doubled again.
  
     7.  Knead the dough slightly, then form into balls the size of an
  orange.  With a rolling pin, flatten to 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.
  
     8.  Prepare a topping by mixing together the melted butter,
  remaining 1 cup sugar and the cinnamon. Spread topping on all sides
  of the rolls.
  
     9.  Let rolls rise until light and about doubled in size. When
  nearly doubled, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake in a preheated
  oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden. Slice thinly and butter
  generously with soft butter. Arrange slices on a platter as desired.

      Title: CINNAMON TORTE
 Categories: Desserts, Vegetarian, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 oz Self-raising flour
      1 ts Powdered cinnamon
      4 oz Ground almonds
      4 oz Caster sugar
      4 oz Butter or margarine
      1    Lemon; (grated rind only)
      8 oz Raspberry jam
           Icing sugar
 
  Sift the flour and cinnamon into a bowl or food processor, then put
  in the ground almonds, sugar, butter or margarine and grated lemon
  rind. Process, without the plunger (to let in more air and make the
  mixture light), or rub the fat into the other ingredients with your
  fingers. Either way, the result will be a soft dough. You can roll
  this out straight away, but it's easier to handle if you wrap it in
  polythene and chill it for 30 minutes.
  
  Set the oven to 180 C/350 F/Gas Mark 4.  On a lightly floured board,
  roll out two-thirds of the almond mixture, to fit a 20 cm/8 inch flan
  tin. Put the pastry into the tin and trim the edges. Spread the jam
  over the pastry, then roll out the remaining pastry, including the
  trimmings, and cut long strips to make a lattice across the top of
  the jam. Bake the torte for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is set

      Title: CINNAMON TWIST (BASIC SWEET DOUGH)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2    Recipe Basic Sweet Dough
  1 1/2 tb Lightly salted butter or
           -margarine, melted
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/3 c  Dark seedless raisins
    1/4 c  Chopped walnuts
    1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
      1 tb Warm milk
    1/4 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Prepare the Basic Sweet Dough.  Lightly grease a baking sheet.
  
  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the Basic Sweet Dough to a
  rectangle 14 x 10-inches.  Brush with the melted butter.
  
  Mix the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the dough. Sprinkle with the
  raisins and walnuts.  Roll up the dough, jelly-roll style, starting
  from one long side. Pinch the ends and seam to seal and place the
  roll, seam down, on the center of the baking sheet.
  
  With scissors, cut the roll at 1-inch intervals almost through to the
  bottom of the roll.  Pull the first slice to the right side and the
  next slice to the left side. Continue, alternating to the right and
  left. Tuck in any raisins that fall out.  Cover and let rise in a
  warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
  
  Heat the oven to 350F.  Bake the coffeecake for 25 to 30 minutes, or
  until lightly browned.  Remove from the baking sheet and cool on a
  wire rack. While the coffeecake is still warm, mix the confectioners'
  sugar with the milk and vanilla; spread over the cake.
  
  Makes one large coffeecake.
  
  NOTE:
  
  For a less sweet coffeecake, omit the confectioners' sugar. Instead,
  mix 2 teaspoons of milk with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar and brush
  over the bread as soon as it comes out of the oven.

      Title: CINNAMON TWISTS
 Categories: New text im, Cooking rig
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
 
    1 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
        1 c  (2 Sticks) Unsalted Butter,
  :          cut into bits
      1/2 c  Sour Cream
      1/2 c  Almonds -- finely chopped
      1/2 c  Sugar
    1 1/2 TB Ground Cinnamon
  
  In a food processor, combine the flour and butter. Pulse 2 or 3 times
  until the mixture resembles very coarse cornmeal. Add the sour cream
  and pulse brefly until the dough just begins to come together. Do not
  over mix. Form into a disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 4
  hours or overnight.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with aluminum
  foil or parchment. In a medium bowl, combine the almonds, sugar, and
  cinnamon. Sprinkle the almond-sugar mixture over a work surface,
  place the disk of dough on top, and roll out into a 9-by-12-inch
  rectangle approximately 1/8-inch thick, encrusting the underside of
  the dough with the almond-sugar mixture. Trim the edges and cut into
  even strips, 9 inches long by 1/2- inch wide.
  
  Gently pick up the ends of the strips and twist 2 or 3 times to form a
  corkscrew shape and place on the baking sheet. Bake the twists for
  approximately 15 minutes or until they're brown and crisp. Remove to
  a rack and allow to cool. The twists should be stored in an airtight
  container even for a few hours and are best eaten the same day they
  are baked.
  
  Yield: approximately 24 twists

      Title: CINNAMON-APPLE LOLLIPOPS
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 20 Each
 
      1 ts Vegetable oil
     10 lg Cinnamon sticks, 2" to
           2 1/2" long
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
      1 ts Cinnamon oil
      2 tb Apple-juice concentrate
 
  Brush vegetable oil evenly over a baking sheet.  With a large chef's
  knife, cut each cinnamon stick in half lengthwise along the groove
  between the two curled edges. Arrange the cinnamon sticks on the
  prepared baking sheet and set aside.  In a heavy medium saucepan,
  combine sugar, corn syrup, cinnamon oil and 1/2 c water; bring to a
  boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
  Clip a candy thermometer to the pan and boil until the temperature
  reaches 300 degrees and is at hard-crack stage (when a bit of syrup
  dropped into ice water is hard and brittle and does not stick to
  teeth).  This will take about ten minutes. Remove from the heat and
  stir in apple-juice concentrate.  Return saucepan to high heat and
  cook, stirring, until thoroughly combined. Continue cooking, swirling
  the pan just until the mixture begins to color, 1 to 3 minutes.
  Immediately remove from heat and let stand until the bubbles subside,
  about 2 minutes. Spoon about 1/2 T of the hot sugar mixture over the
  tip of each cinnamon stick and let stand until hardened, about 5
  minutes.  (If the sugar mixture hardens before all lollipops are
  formed, return the pan to high heat just until the syrup begins to
  bubble; be careful not to let it burn. Let stand for 1 to 2 minutes,
  then continue.) When lollipops have set, carefully loosen them from
  the baking sheet. (The lollipops can be stored in an airtight
  container, with was paper between each layer, in a cool, dry place
  for up to 1 week.)  28 calories per lollipop: 0 g protein, 1 g fat, 6

  Many thanks to Laurie from Virginia.  Laurie sent me a recipe for
  cinnamon-pineapple sauce that I made the other day. It was
  incredible... even better than the one I had at that restaurant...
  and VERY EASY!
  
  Combine ingredients in 2 qt. saucepan.  Cook over medium high heat,
  stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and heated through,
  about 3 ~ 5 minutes. I used this sauce for dipping chicken nuggets
  into.
  
  Thanks again, Laurie!!!

      Title: CINNAMON-RAISIN BISCOTTI
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      6    Eggwhites
      1 tb Vanilla
      1 c  Sugar
      2 c  Flour
      2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Raisins
 
  Variations:
  
  for Almond-Cocoa Biscotti: (omit cinnamon and raisins) add 3/4cup
  slivered, toasted almonds, 2t almond extract and 1/3 cup cocoa
  
  for Orange-Pistascio Biscotti: (omit cinnamon and raisins) add 3/4cup
  toasted pistaccio nuts, 1T orange zest, 2T orange juice conc (the
  frozen stuff), and you may need a little extra flour.
  
  Beat egg whites and extracts (and orange juice, if using) together
  well. Combine all the dry ingred. and add to the egg and mix well.
  Fold in the raisins or nuts. The dough should be firm, but not too
  stiff. You may need to add as much as 1/4cup more flour if your egg
  whites were large or you are using the orange juice.
  
  Divide the dough in half and shape each into a 'log' about 2" wide and
  10"long.  Place each on a greased cookie sheet and bake in a
  preheated oven at 325F for 25-30 min.
  
  They should be firm to the touch, but not too brown. Remove from the
  oven and turn down the temp to 250F.
  
  Slice each olg into 20-24 pieces and place upright (if you can balance
  them!) on the cookie sheets. Return to the oven for about 30-40 min.
  The thicker the slices, the longer it takes, but they should not
  brown too much more.  Cool them COMPLETELY before storing them in an
  airtight container.
  
  The cinnamon/raisin ones have only a trace of fat per cookie and the
  ones with nuts have 1.5g fat per cookie.
  
  These are VERY crunchie and you really do need some tea or a nice skim
  capiccino to dunk them in! Submitted By RHOMMEL

  discard bay leaf.
  
  Add the halibut, shrimp, scallops and wine, simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Place clams and fish in pot and steam 5 - 10 minutes until the clams
  open and the fish is flaky.*
  
  Serve in soup bowls, sprinkled with parsley, accompanied by French or

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Sliced bacon
      2    Onions, sliced
      2    Green peppers, hulled and

  Your will need a large soup pot.  Chop up one slice of bacon, and fry
  it in a heavy stewpan until the fat runs. Fry the onions in the fat
  until they are golden. Add the peppers and fry them, too. Remove the
  stewpan from the heat.  Layer the cabbage and the rest of the bacon
  into the soup pot. Season between the layers with salt, pepper, and
  the herbs.
  
  Pour the water over it all and bring to a boil.  Turn the heat down
  and simmer the soup for 40 to 50 minutes, until the vegetables are
  tender. Remove the soup from the heat.
  
  Beat the egg yolks with the cream and the vinegar in a little bowl.
  Stir in a ladleful of the hot soup. Whisk well and pour the mixture
  back into the soup to thicken and enrich it.
  
  Serve in deep bowls accompanied with fresh bread. This soup is a meal
  in itself, and wants only a piece of cheese and fresh fruit to make it
  complete.

      Title: CITRUS-PEPPER SORBET
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      4 lg Navel oranges *
      3    Yellow wax hot peppers,
           -chopped
    1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
      3 tb Light corn syrup
      2 tb Dark rum
 
  * not juice oranges, peeled and white pith removed
  
  Sorbets can be served either as a dessert or as a refresher between
  courses. Peppers add just a little heat to the frozen fruit juices.
  If your ice-cream freezer holds less than 6 cups, make this in
  batches or halve the recipe.
  
  At once cold and hot, Citrus-Pepper Sorbet has fruity flavor with a
  bite.
  
  Combine 1 1/4 cups water with sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a
  boil, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and
  cool to room temperature. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
  
  Meanwhile, chop the fruit, discarding any seeds. (You should have
  about 3 1/2 cups.) In a blender or food processor, Puree oranges and
  remaining ingredients. Add 1/2 cup water, blend briefly and strain
  through a sieve. Refrigerate until needed.
  
  Stir the sugar mixture into the fruit mixture. Pour the mixture into
  an ice cream freezer and freeze according to the manufacturer's
  directions. (Alternatively, transfer the mixture to a shallow pan and
  freeze until almost solid. Break into large chunks and whirl the
  mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth. Transfer to a
  chilled airtight container and return to the freezer for 30 minutes
  to 1 hour, or until firm.)

      Title: CLAM & OLIVE DIP
 Categories: Dips, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 cn Black olives, drained
      1 cn Chopped or minced clams,
           -drained
      1 pt Sour cream
           Salt
           Powdered garlic
           Cayenne pepper
 
  Open can of olives.  Eat a handful, just to make sure. Eat a few
  more. As long as you leave at least half the can, you've got enough.
  Chop them up. Add the chopped olives to the rest of the ingredients,
  stir, and chill for 2 hours before serving.
  
  Quantities on the spices are left to you.
  
  Btw, if you have never tried cream cheese and chopped olive
  sandwiches, let me recommend them.  Soften a package of cream cheese,
  add small can chopped olives and a teaspoon or so of lemon juice.
  Stir well and spread. Gutsy eaters add turkey.

      2    Cloves garlic, minced
           Fresh Ital. parsley, minced
      2 tb Creme fraiche
           Olive oil
      1 tb Flour
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 c  Water
           Fresh chervil, minced
      1 ds Louisiana hot sauce
    1/2 lb Spaghetti or linguine
           Freshly ground black pepper
      3    Heated pasta plates/bowls
 
  Soak clams in cold fresh water. Put a large pot of water on to boil
  for the pasta. Put the bay leaf, the wine, and the water in a large
  covered non-reactive skillet and bring to a boil. Simmer for 5 min.
  Return to med-high heat and add clams. Cover. Cook until you start to
  hear clams popping open - about 5 min. Begin checking on clams every
  30 seconds and remove clams to heated covered bowl as they open,
  replacing covers each time. If any clams have not opened after 10
  minutes total cooking, discard them. When clams are done, pour all
  accumulated broth into a pitcher and set aside. Put pasta in boiling
  water to begin cooking and set timer so that pasta will be slightly
  undercooked. Return skillet to moderate heat and add olive oil,
  garlic, flour, and half the minced herbs. Cook 2 - 5 minutes, but
  ***do not let the garlic even begin to brown***. Add about a cup of
  the clam broth. Stir with a whisk. Broth should thicken slightly into
  a thin sauce. Reduce or add more broth as necessary. Whisk in the
  creme fraiche and the hot sauce and bring just back to a simmer, then
  remove from heat. Toss with cooked pasta. Put pasta on heated bowls
  and surround with clams. Sprinkle generously with freshly-ground
  pepper and the other half of the herbs.

     36    Cherrystone Clams
    1/2 lb Butter, Room Temperature
    1/4 c  Chopped Shallots
      1 tb Chopped Garlic
    1/2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce

  When renowned chef Pierre Franey visited Avery Island, he observed
  some age-old local commercial enterprises ~ crawfish farming, oyster
  shucking and boudin making ~ with great curiosity and enthusiasm.
  Here he brings his incomparable touch to cherrystone clams, best
  enjoyed with a loaf of crusty French bread and a carafe of wine. The
  southermers defer to the Yankees on this one.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Preheat the broiler.  Open the clams and arrange
  them neatly on half shells on a baking sheet. In a small bowl, cream
  the butter with the remaining ingredients. Spoon the mixture evenly
  over the clams. Place them under the broiler for 1 minute. Serve
  immediately with French bread.

  This recipe needs a large baking tray, 45 cm x 30 cm (18'' x 12 '').
  Use up the egg yolks by making a 'Creme Brulee'. The fruit filling
  can be varied, you can also try Clare's 'Chestnut Syllabub' as
  filling.
  
  Preheat the oven to 180 oC/350 oF/gas mark 4. Line the baking tray
  with greaseproof paper.
  
  Whisk the egg whites until stiff. Continue whisking fast, then add the
  caster sugar a spoonful at a time. >>> Continued to next message

      4 c  Plum sauce

      4 tb Chicken broth
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      3 tb Honey or corn syrup
      3 tb Hoisin sauce
      2 tb Wine vinegar
      2 tb Dry sherry or

      2 cl (medium) garlic,
           Chopped fine
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
        pn (tiny) 5-spice powder
           (optional)

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
           Plum sauce
           Scallion, chopped
 
  Preheat the oven 10 375 degree F. Trim any excess fat from the ribs
  and place them in a long shallow dish. In a mixing bowl, combine the
  marinade ingredients; if you are using 5-spice powder, add it to the
  mixture by putting it through a tea strainer so it spreads out over
  the mixture. Mix well, and pour over the ribs and leave for 3 hours
  at room temperature or about 6 hours in the refrigerator. Baste the
  ribs every hours or so, turning them over. TO ROAST THE RIBS: Remove
  the ribs from the marinade. Add the 1/4 cup plum sauce to the
  marinade; reserve it for basting. Hook metal drapery hooks through
  both ends of each rack of ribs, at the top, and hang each one as if
  you were hanging a hammock, suspended from the bars of one of the
  oven racks. Set the oven rack in the highest position in the oven. On
  the floor of the oven or on another oven rack set at the lowest
  position in the oven, place a baking pan half filled with water, to
  collect drippings and prevent smoking. You may want to line the
  baking pan with aluminum foil before putting the water in, to make it
  easier to clean. Roast the spareribs for 45 minutes in the preheated
  oven. Then baste them with the reserved basting sauce, using a small
  pastery brush and carefully pulling out the oven rack to facilitate
  the basting process. Turn the oven up to 450 degrees F and roast for
  another 15 minutes. By this time the spareribs should be a rich
  golden brown with crisp edges. Baste again, then take them out of the
  oven. Place the ribs on a cutting board and remove the drapery hooks.
  Separate the individual ribs with a cleaver or sharp knife. Serve at
  room temperature, with dipping sauce. Makes 6 to 8 appetizer
  servings. NOTE: You will need about 12 drapery hooks. Recipe:

  well. 2. Gradually add enough wine to make a firm dough. Knead until
  smooth & elastic. Roll into very thin sheets; cut into 12 squares. 3.
  Place metal cannoli tubes diagonally onto each square so tube divides
  each square into 2 triangles. Lay points of triangles over tubes so
  they meet in middle. Separate remaining egg & use a little of the egg
  white to moisten overlap. Press gently to seal. 4. Heat 3-4 inches
  deep olive oil in deep pan. Fry cannoli until golden brown, drain
  well on paper towels, & cool. Remove metal tubes. 5. Combine
  remaining part of egg with ricottta cheese, orange flower water,
  candied orange, & chocolate & blend well. Fill cannoli with cheese
  mixture. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.

      Title: CLASSIC CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate,
           -finely chopped
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
      3 tb To 4 tb cocoa powder
  1 1/2 lb Bittersweet chocolate *
 
  * to be tempered (see directions below)
  
  These truffles are as close as you can get to eating pure chocolate.
  When you bite through the outer coating, you are treated to a creamy
  rich chocolate center. They will make you feel like royalty.
  
  Melt the chopped chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot, not
  simmering, water, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula to ensure
  even melting. In a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream
  to a boil. Remove both pans from the heat, remove the top pan, from
  the double boiler and wipe it dry (see Editor's Note), pour the cream
  into the melted chocolate, and stir together until thoroughly
  blended. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover, let cool to room
  temperature, and chill in the refrigerator until thick but not stiff
  (2 to 3 hours).
  
  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Fit a 12- inch
  pastry bag with a #5 large, plain round tip and fill partway with the
  truffle cream. Holding the pastry. bag 1 inch above the paper, pipe
  out mounds about 1 inch in diameter. Cover the mounds with plastic
  wrap and chill in the freezer for 2 hours or in the refrigerator for
  6 hours. Dust your hands with cocoa powder and roll the mounds into
  balls. These will be the truffle centers. Cover and chill the centers
  for another 2 hours in the freezer.
  
  Melt and temper the 1 1/2 pounds bittersweet chocolate. Line 2 more
  baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Remove the truffle
  centers from the freezer 1 sheet at a time. Place a truffle center
  into the tempered chocolate, coating it completely. With a dipper or
  fork remove the center from the chocolate, carefully shake off the
  excess chocolate, and turn the truffle out onto the paper. Then dip a
  fork into the chocolate and form lines across the tops of the
  truffles by moving the fork from one side of the baking sheet to the
  other, letting the chocolate drop off. Repeat with the remaining
  sheet of truffle centers.
  
  Let the truffles set at room temperature or chill them in the
  refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes. When the truffles are set, place
  them in paper candy cups. In a tightly covered container wrapped in
  several layers of aluminum foil, the truffles will keep for 1 month
  in the refrigerator or 2 months in the freezer. The truffles are best
  served at room temperature.
  
  Variations
  
  Instead of dipping the truffle centers into tempered cho- colate,
  roll them in cocoa powder, confectioners' sugar, or finely chopped
  nuts as soon as they are rolled into balls.
  
  Classic White Chocolate Truffles
  
  Substitute 1 pound white chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate in
  the centers, and use 3/4 cup whipping cream. Dip the centers and line
  the tops of the truffles with tempered white chocolate, or roll the
  centers in confectioners' sugar as soon as they are rolled into balls.
  
  Classic Milk Chocolate Truffles
  
  Substitute milk chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate in the
  centers and for the coating, and 1 cup whipping cream.
  
  Quick tempering method
  
  Chop 1 1/2 pounds of chocolate into very small pieces and set aside
  1/2 pound. Melt the remaining 1 pound in the top of a double boiler
  over hot, not simmering, water, stirring frequently with a rubber
  spatula to ensure even melting. The chocolate should not exceed 120
  degrees F (110 degrees F for white cho- colate) or it will burn.
  Remove the double boiler from the heat, then remove the top pan of
  the double boiler and wipe it dry. Stir in the remaining chocolate in
  three to four batches, making sure that each batch is completely
  melted before adding the next. When all the chocolate has been added,
  the chocolate will be tempered.
  
  Editor's note: It's important to follow this step. Carole Bloom says
  water is the enemy of chocolate and that even a few drops can cause a
  pan of chocolate to "seize up" and resemble mud. If this happens, she
  says you cannot salvage it. Make sure all utensils are completely dry
  when working with chocolate.
  
  Yield: 60 1-inch round truffles.

    1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil

    2/3 c  Scallions; chopped
 
  Boil the whole unpeeled potatoes in generously salted water until fork

           Water
    1/2 c  Milk -- or more
      2 tb Butter
           Salt and pepper -- to taste
      1 pn Nutmeg -- optional
 
  Cover the potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil. Cook for 20
  minutes, or until tender. (Watch the pot! Potatoes have a tendency to
  boil over.) While the spuds are cooking, slowly heat the milk and
  butter. When the potatoes are done, drain them and add half the hot
  milk mixture. Mash the potatoes with a handheld potato masher or an
  electric mixer. Keep adding the hot milk until you reach the proper
  consistency (which, of course, varies from family to family). Season
  with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, if desired. Serves 4 to 6.
  
  VARIATIONS- *Spuds with Jewels: In a frying pan, heat 1 teaspoon of
  vegetable oil and briefly saute 1 diced red pepper (add hot peppers
  such as green jalapeno for fire). Stir in 1/2 teaspoon basil.
  Immediately pour on top of mashed potatoes.
  
  *Green Potatoes: Use an electric mixer to blend 1 to 2 cups chopped
  cooked spinach into one batch of mashed potatoes until they turn
  green.
  
  *Red Coats: Use purple, red, or new potatoes with their skins on.
  
  *The Cheddar Broccoli: Mix 1/22 cup grated Cheddar cheese with 1 cup
  chopped, steamed broccoli florets and fold into the mashed spuds.
  
  *Prague Potatoes: Panfry 4 strips bacon until crisp. Remove from the
  pan and add 1 diced onion, cooking until translucent. Crumble the
  bacon into the onion. Top mashed potatoes with bacon, onion, and
  drippings, using 1 1/2 teaspoons, or less, of fat per serving.
  
  *Golden Broil: Spread prepared mashed potatoes in an oven-to-table
  baking dish. Drizzle 1/2 cup heavy cream over the top and sprinkle
  with Parmesan cheese. Broil until the top turns golden.
  
  *Breakfast for Dinner: Serve mashed potatoes in a large bowl topped
  with 3 to 4 chopped hard-boiled eggs chopped fresh parsley and chives.
  
  *Tatties'n'Neeps: For the Scots' way of using up leftover mashed
  pototoes, mix equal amounts of mashed potatoes and mashed turnips.
  
  *Colcannon: Mix mashed potatoes with l 1/2 cups shredded, cooked,
  drained cabbage or kale. 20 *Bangers and Mash: Try this English
  recipe - serve plain mashed Potatoes with broiled or pan-seared
  sausages ("bangers") on the side.
  
  *Fenced-in Spuds: Surround a mound of mashed potatoes with a fence of
  steamed green beans and carrot sticks.

      Title: CLASSIC MEATLOAF
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
      8 oz Tomato sauce
      1 c  Soft bread crumbs
      1 sm Onion; finely chopped
      1    Egg; slightly beaten
      2 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Dried thyme leaves
    1/2 ts Garlic salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 tb Packed brown sugar
      1 ts Dry mustard
 
  By shaping the ground beef mixture into small, two-serving loaves,
  baking time can be reduced by 30 minutes. Gentle handling when mixing
  the ground beef with the other ingredients will ensure a moist,
  tender meatloaf.
  
  Preparation and cooking time: 1 hr.
  
  1. Heat oven to 350 F. Reserve 1/4 cup tomato sauce. In large bowl,
  combine ground beef, remaining tomato sauce, bread crumbs, onion, egg,
  Worcestershire sauce, thyme, garlic salt and pepper, mixing lightly
  but thoroughly.
  
  2. Divide mixture into thirds and shape to form three loaves, each
  about 1-1/2 inches thick; place on rack in open roasting pan. Combine
  reserved tomato sauce, brown sugar and mustard; spread over top of
  loaves.
  
  3. Bake in 350 F oven 40 to 45 minutes or until no longer pink and
  juices run clear. To serve cut each meatloaf into 1-inch thick slices.
  
  Cook's tip: To make soft bread crumbs, place torn bread slices in food
  processor, fitted with steel blade, or blender container. Cover;
  process 30 seconds, pulsing on and off, until fine crumbs. One and a
  half slices will yield 1 cup soft bread crumbs.

      Title: CLASSIC POTATO PANCAKES
 Categories: Pancakes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 lb Mealy russet potatoes,
           -peeled
      1 md Onion, coarsely grated
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
      2 tb Matzo meal, or as needed
           Salt to taste
           Pepper
      1 ds Sugar to encourage browning
           Vegetable oil for frying
           Sour cream, yogurt, and/or
           -applesauce
 
  Grate potatoes.
  
  Squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible.
  
  Combine potatoes, onion, eggs, matzo meal, salt, pepper and sugar.
  
  Take half of this mixture and puree in a food processor or blender,
  then recombine it with the remaining mixture.
  
  Add more matzo meal if needed to make a thick batter.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy frying pan.
  
  You will probably get by on a slick about 1/8 inch deep, especially
  in a nonstick pan, but the deeper and hotter the oil the crisper the
  pancake.
  
  Use a large spoon to drop portions of the mixture into the hot oil.
  
  For thicker pancakes leave the batter mounded up high, for thinner,
  lacier and crispier-edged disks, flatten the batter with a spoon as
  soon as you add it to the pan.
  
  Cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes, then turn and repeat on the
  other side.
  
  Latkes don't take kindly to being turned too man times and become
  rather heavy as the continue to flip.
  
  When golden on both sides, remove to paper towels and drain for a
  moment before serving.
  
  Accompany hot latkes with sour cream, yogurt and/or applesauce.
  
  Sage latkes: Season with 1/2 teaspoon or so crumbled dry sage leaves
  (or 1 teaspoon fresh) and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Fry in duck or
  goose fat.
  
  Garlic rosemary latkes: Omit onion and add 2 cloves chopped garlic
  along with 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary. Cook in olive oil and
  serve with a sprinkling of salt rather than sour cream.
  
  Leek latkes: Omit onion and substitute julienned leeks.
  
  Brussels sprouts: surprising and deliciously wintry. Add 6 or so
  coarsely grated Brussels sprouts to the potato batter. Serve with
  sour cream seasoned with a dash of Dijon or whole-seed mustard. Do
  not let Brussels sprout latkes sit around too long; they become
  bitter.

      Title: CLASSIC PRIME RIB
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Standing roast of beef
           - (4-rib, about 10-11 lbs)
      2 tb Flavorless cooking oil
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. TRIM the excess fat from the roast, leaving only
  1/4-inch of fat. Heat the oil in a large roasting pan over
  medium-to-high heat on top of the stove. When the oil is hot, place
  the roast, fat-side down, in the pan and brown for 5 minutes. Turn
  the roast on one end and cook another 5 minutes. Turn on the other
  end and cook 5 minutes. Remove from heat and discard fat. Sprinkle
  with desired salt and pepper. Place roast in oven and immediately
  reduce heat to 350F. Roast approximately 12 minutes per pound for
  medium-rare, or about 2 hours for a 10-lb roast. Remove the pan from
  the oven, remove the roast from the pan and let stand for 25 minutes
  before carving. To serve, strain the gravy into a sauceboat and carve
  the roast at the table, counting on about 2 people per rib. FREEZING
  THE ROAST: Do not carve the entire roast if you don't have to. A
  whole solid piece of meat is more successfully cooked when defrosted
  than a few smaller pieces. Before freezing, heat a dry fry pan over
  high heat on top of the stove. Place the remainder of the roast, cut
  side down, in the pan and sear well. Allow the roast to cool to room
  temperature. Wrap with freezer paper and then over wrap in plastic
  wrap. Label and place in the freezer for up to 1 month. Defrost,
  without unwrapping, in the refrigerator for 24 to 28 hours. To reheat
  defrosted rib roast, wrap prime rib in 1 layer of microwave plastic
  wrap and place in a covered roasting pan or Dutch oven. Cover, place
  in the oven, turn temperature to 250F and cook about 8 minutes per
  pound or until a meat thermometer placed in the thickest part of the
  roast reads 110F. Remove pan from the oven and turn temperature to
  450F. Unwrap the roast, replace, uncovered in the pan and replace in
  the oven for about 15 minutes to crust the outside.

           Black olives for garnish
 
  Crust:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grind oats to a coarse flour n a
  blender or food processor. Place ground oats in a large bowl. Stir in
  whole wheat flour, white flour, salt and baking powder. Drizzle 1/4
  cup canola oil over flour mixture and mix lightly; add more oil of
  necessary, until mixture looks like wet sand. Drizzle lemon juice,
  honey or maple syrup and 2 T water over dough.  Mix lightly with a
  fork until dough forms a ball, adding more water if necessary. Roll
  out dough between sheets of waxed paper. Sprinkle sesame seeds evenly
  over bottom of a quiche or pie pan, then place dough in pan. (If
  using a pie pan, fold excess dough over to form an edge about 2/4
  inch thick; try to keep edge even, smooth and slightly away from the
  edge of pan.) Prick sides and bottom of crust with a fork. Bake for
  20 minutes, remove from oven and reduce temperature to 350 degrees.
  Filling: Heat 1 teaspoon water or oil in a skillet over medium heat.
  Add onion and saute for 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for 30
  seconds. Add broccoli florettes and 1 to 2 tablespoons water, then
  cover. Steam until broccoli is bright green and slightly tender but
  not soft, about 2 minutes. Drain vegetables if necessary; place in
  prebaked pie crust and spread evenly over bottom. In a blender or
  food processor, whip tofu, mustard, basil or rosemary, nutmeg, salt,
  pepper and nutritional yeast. Blend 1 to 2 minutes, until very
  smooth. Pour tofu mixture over vegetables in pie crust. Place red
  pepper or black olives on top if desired. Bake 40 minutes, until
  slightly puffy. Allow to cool 5 to 10 minutes before slicing. Serves
  6. Variation: substitute 3 cups of any vegetable for the broccoli.
  Try lightly steamed asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and leeks, or red
  pepper and zucchini. Veganized version of classic tofu recipe in

      Title: CLASSIC RAGU BOLOGNESE
 Categories: Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
     10 oz Salt pork lean; small dice
      1 qt ;Water
      1 c  Carrot; diced (1/8")
    2/3 c  Celery; diced
    1/2 c  Onion; diced
  1 1/4 lb Skirt steak or chuck blade
           -roast; coarsely ground
    1/2 c  Wine, white, dry
      2 tb Tomato paste; diluted in
     10 tb Meat or poultry stock
      1 c  Milk
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  Cooking the cream: Simmer the cream in a tiny saucepan until reduced
  by one-third. There should be about six tablespoons. Set aside.
  
  Blanching the salt pork: Fresh fatback needs no blanching.  If you are
  using salt pork, boil the water, add the salt pork and cook for three
  minutes. Drain and pat dry.
  
  Browning the ragu base: Saut the salt pork or fatback in a three-to
  four-quart heavy sauce pan over medium-low heat. Saut eight minutes
  or until almost all its fat is rendered. Stir in the chopped
  vegetables. Saut for three minutes over medium-low heat, or until
  the onion is translucent. Raise the heat to medium and stir in the
  beef. Brown five minutes or until the meat is medium brown in color
  and almost but not quite crisp.
  
  Take care not to let the meat become overly dry or hard.
  
  Simmering and serving: Stir in the wine and diluted tomato paste and
  reduce heat to very low. It is critical that the mixture reduce as
  slowly as possible.  Cook, partially covered, for two hours. From
  time to time, stir in a tablespoon or so of the milk. By the end of
  two hours, all the milk should be used up and the ragu should be only
  slightly liquid. Stir in the reduced cream.  Toss the hot ragu with
  freshly cooked pasta and serve.
  
  Makes enough sauce for 1 1/2 pounds of dried pasta.  Chicago Tribune
  test kitchen notes: "We tried the recipe twice, the second time using
  only five ounces of salt pork and found this reduction in fat to be
  quite acceptable."

      Title: CLASSIC SOURDOUGH BREAD**
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Sourdough starter
  1 1/3 c  Warm water
      5    To 6 c all-purpose flour or
           -a combination of
           All-purpose and whole wheat
           -flours
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Baking soda
 
  Cornmeal to sprinkle on pans
  
  THE SPONGE: Pour 1 c of starter into a large ceramic mixing bowl.
  Feed and then refrigerate the remainder. Add to the starter in the
  mixing bowl, the warm water and about 3 c of flour. Beat vigorously
  with a spoon or wire whisk. Cover this sponge with plastic wrap and
  put it aside to work. This time period can be very flexible, but
  allow at least 2 hours and as many as 24. The longer it has, the more
  yeast there will be for the second rise and the more pronounced the
  sour flavor of the bread will be.
  
  THE DOUGH: After sponge has bubbled and expanded, remove plastic wrap.
  Blend salt, sugar and baking soda into 2 c of flour. Mix this into
  sponge with large spoon. When dough begins to hold together, turn it
  out onto floured board and knead it for 3 or 4 minutes. Add flour as
  needed to make a fairly stiff dough.Give the dough a rest and clean
  the bowl. Continue kneading for another 3 or 4 minutes. Place the
  dough back in the bowl turning it to grease the top. Cover and let
  rise for 2 to 4 hours.If you want, you can skip the second rise in
  the bowl and proceed directly to the next step.
  
  SHAPING AND BAKING THE LOAVES: Knock down the dough and shape it into
  2 long loaves. Place them on a cornmeal sprinkled cookie sheet, cover
  and let them rise for another 2 hours or so.Toward the end of the
  rising period, preheat your oven to 450 F and begin heating a kettle
  of water on your stove. Just before you put them in the oven, slash
  the tops of your loaves diagonally with a knife 1/4" deep every two
  inches and brush with cold water.Place a baking pan on the oven
  bottom and put in 3 or 4 cups of boiling water. Put the loaves on the
  rack over the steaming water, close the oven and bake for about 25
  minutes.

      Title: CLASSIC SPINACH LASAGNA
 Categories: Main dish, Pasta
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 oz Dried porcini mushrooms
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 oz Pancetta; chopped
           - (or blanched bacon)
      3 tb Chopped onion
    1/2 lb Ground round of beef
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 oz Chicken livers
           - cleaned and minced
      2 tb Tomato paste

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Fresh spinach; -=OR=-
      2 pk -Frozen Spinach
           Salt
      1 c  Ricotta
      1    Egg
           Whole nutmeg
      1 lb Freshly made lasagna noodles
  1 1/2 tb Butter
      1 c  Freshly grated parmigiano
 
  TO MAKE THE MEAT SAUCE: Put the dried mushrooms in a bowl and pour 1
  cup boiling water over them. Let them sit for 30 minutes, then drain,
  reserving the water. Rinse the mushroom pieces thoroughly, chop them
  fine, and rinse again to remove all traces of grit. Line a sieve with
  a dampened paper towel and strain the mushroom-soaking liquid into a
  small bowl. Heat the olive oil in a large non-reactive skillet. Add
  the pancetta and onion and saute over low heat 5 minutes. Raise heat
  to medium, crumble in the ground beef, and add 1/4 teaspoon of salt
  and several grindings of fresh pepper. Saute 5 more minutes, stirring
  to break up the meat. Add the chopped chicken livers and the chopped
  porcini. In a measuring cup, combine 1/2 cup of the mushroom-soaking
  liquid and 1/2 cup hot water. Dissolve the tomato paste in this
  liquid and add it to the skillet. Bring to a simmer, cover the pan
  and cook 1 hour, stirring occasionally and regulating the heat to
  maintain a gentle simmer. TO MAKE THE SPINACH FILLING: If you are
  using fresh spinach, wash it carefully, and place it in a large pot
  with only the amount of water that clings to the leaves. Sprinkle
  lightly with salt, cover the pot and turn heat to high. As soon as
  the spinach wilts, reduce heat to medium and cook 5 minutes. (If
  using frozen spinach, cook according to package directions.) Drain
  the spinach in a colander, spray with cold water, squeeze out most of
  the water, and chop it fine. Put it into a bowl and add the ricotta,
  the egg, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and several gratings of fresh nutmeg.
  Stir all together well. COOKING THE LASAGNA: Bring a large pot of
  salted water to the boil. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Lay out
  several clean dish towels on a work surface. Drop the lasagna noodles
  a few at a time into the boiling water and cook 1 minute. Drain them
  with a slotted spoon, dip them into the bowl of ice water to stop the
  cooking, and lay them out on the dish towels while you cook the rest.
  ASSEMBLY AND BAKING: Preheat oven to 400F. Butter a 10-by-14-inch
  baking dish with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Cover the bottom of the dish
  with a layer of lasagna noodles. (Use about a quarter of them.)
  Spread 1/4 of the spinach-ricotta mixture over the surface. Sprinkle
  on 1/4 of the parmigiano, then 1/4 of the meat sauce. Make 3 more
  layers in the same way, ending with the cheese and meat sauce.
  Finally, dot the top with the remaining tablespoon of butter. Bake 15
  minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling hot. Remove from the oven and
  let sit for 10 minutes before serving.

      Title: CLASSICAL PUFF PASTRY
 Categories: Baker, Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           3  1/2 c  all-purpose flour
           1  1/2 ts salt
      1 lb Unsalted butter, cold
  1 1/4 c  Ice water
 
  Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and
  process few seconds to combine.  Cut 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the
  butter into small pieces and process with the flour until there are
  no lumps and the mixture is the texture of cornmeal.
  
  Pour half the ice water in a large bowl and turn the flour mixture
  onto it. Sprinkle the remaining water over it, reserving one
  tablespoon. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl, drizzle the
  ice water evenly over it and toss like a salad until the dough comes
  together in a ragged mass. Add the remaining water if necessary.
  Cover in plastic wrap and chill.
  
  Meanwhile, place the remaining butter between layers of plastic wrap
  and pound with a rolling pin to make malleable.  Place it between two
  sheets of plastic wrap and, using your hands or a rolling pin, shape
  it into a 6-inch square.
  
  Remove the dough from the fridge, lightly flour the work surface and,
  using either your hands or a rolling pin, shape the mass into 12-inch
  square. Place the butter on the dough catty-corner and fold the edges
  of the dough into the center to enclose it.
  
  Lightly flour the surface of the dough and roll it into a rectangle
  measuring about 12 inches high x 26 inches wide.  If the dough sticks,
  loosen it underneath with a long flexible metal palette knife and
  scrape off any butter sticking to the work surface.  Brush off any
  excess flour. Fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees, so
  that seams are parallel to the table's edge.  This is called a
  "turn". Lightly flour and roll it out again to about 12 x 26 inches.
  Brush off the excess flour and again fold it into thirds. Place the
  dough on a sheet tray, cover it with a plastic bag and refrigerate
  for 20 to 30 minutes.
  
  Repeat this, giving the dough two more turns, each time rolling it
  out to 12 x 26 inches.  Refrigerate for another 20 or 30 minutes,
  then give the dough 2 final turns.  There are six turns in all.
  
  Lightly roll it to flatten and even it.  Wrap it in plastic wrap or a
  bag and chill for at least two hours before using it.  It can be kept,
  refrigerated, for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.
  
  Yield:  2- 3/4 pounds of dough
  
  To roll pastry:  (for home size 11 x 17-inch sheet trays)
  
  For thinly rolled dough (1/16-inch) used to make little pizzas start
  with 15 ounces (1/3 of the recipe).  For thickly rolled dough
  (3/8-inch) used for everything else, start with 22 ounces (1/2
  recipe).
  
  Line an 11 x 17-inch sheet tray with parchment paper.  On a floured
  table, roll the rectangle of dough to a length of 15 inches and a
  width of 10 inches.  Dust off any excess flour.  Roll the dough up
  onto the rolling pin and transfer it to the sheet tray.  Using a
  10-inch rolling pin and rolling gently from the center out, roll the
  dough to fit the tray. Make sure it is even - with no lumpy edges.
  Rolling lightly and gently enables you to keep it even.
  
  Shapes to cut out of the 3/8-inch thick dough:
  
  Bouchee:  Cut 2 (3-1/2-inch) rounds of dough.  Cut a 2-1/4-inch
  circle out of the second round.  Egg wash the first round.  Place the
  ring from the second round over the first so that the edges line up.
  Dock the edges and center with a fork.  Thin inner circle can be
  baked as well and used for a lid.
  
  Bouchee made from special cutter:  Use and cutter made especially for
  this purpose.  It has two cutting edges - one inside and shorter than
  the other that scores, rather than cuts the dough.
  
  Criss-cross Tartlet:  Cut a 5-inch square.  Fold it into a triangle
  and cut from each edge towards the apex, stopping about 1/2-inch
  short of the apex. The cut should be about 1/2-inch from the edge.
  Open it up to the square and place on a cookie sheet.  Egg wash the
  edges. Bring one point over to the opposite corner of the inner
  square and press. Bring the opposite point over and press.  Press
  along the rim to seal. Dock rim and center.
  
  Puff Strip:  From a sheet tray of frozen dough, cut a rectangular
  piece 8" wide and the length of the sheet tray.  Transfer it to a
  paper lined cookie sheet.  Using a pizza wheel, cut a 3/4" strip from
  each edge. Egg wash the edges of the center piece and flip the cut
  strips onto the egg washed edge. Dock the 2 rims with a fork, then
  dock down the center.
  
  Vol-au-Vent:  Similar to above, but round.  Press whatever size round
  you want into the dough on the sheet tray.  Lift and cut along the
  circular impression with a pizza wheel.  Center another round, and
  inch or so smaller in diameter than the first over the circle of
  dough and press lightly.  Remove and cut along this line.  Egg was
  the edge, as above, and cut through the outer rim in one place. Place
  the rim over the center circle, lining up the edges.  Dock the rim
  with a fork, then dock the center.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes in a
  preheated 425 degree F. oven.

           4 c boiling water
           1 T powdered alum
           1/2 tsp oil of cinnamon
           -(optional)
 
  1.  Combine flour and sugar in a large pot.  slowly stir in cold

  vigorously to bread up lumps. 3. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring
  constantly, until thick and clear. 4. Remove from heat and add alum.
  Stir until well mixed. 5. Add oil of cinnamon if paste will not be
  used immediately.
  
  Makes about 1-1/2 qts.
  
  How to Use It:  Classroom paste is a good all-purpose paste,
  especially appropriate for work with children. It is also excellent
  for papier-mache projects. Stored in a closely capped jar, this paste
  will keep for several weeks.  It keeps longer than Paper Paste and is
  a little softer. If it gets too thick it can be thinned with hot
  water for easy spreading.

 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Bean Thread Noodles
      2 tb Vegetable Oil
    1/4 c  Cilantro Pesto (See Recipe)
      1 tb Fresh Ginger, Finely Chopped
      1 lb Shrimp, Peeled & Deveined
    1/3 c  Coarsely Chopped Green Onion
    1/4 c  Chicken Stock
      2 tb Fish Sauce (Nam Pla)
      1 tb Oyster Sauce
      1 tb Chinese Rice Wine Or:
           Dry Sherry
      1 ts Dark Soy Sauce
      1 ts Asian Sesame Oil
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
           Handful Of Cilantro Leaves

MMMMM-----------------------CILANTRO PESTO----------------------------
      1 ts Whole White Or Black
           Peppercorns
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Fresh
           Cilantro Roots Or Leaves
           And Stems
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Garlic
 
  CILANTRO PESTO:  Using a mortor and pestle or a spice grinder, crush
  or grind the peppercorns to a fine powder. Combine the pepper,
  cilantro roots and garlic; work the three inngredients innto a fairly
  smooth paste in the mortor or in a small blender or food processor.
  If you use a blender or food processor, you may need to add a little
  vegetable oil or water to ease the grinding.  Make about 1/4 cup. For
  an industrial strength batch use 1 tb peppercorns, 1/2 cup cilantro
  roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the pesto for later use, put in a
  glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface to cover it and seal
  tightly. It will keep nicely for about 1 week in the refrigerator.
  
  CLAY POT SHRIMP:  Place the noodles in a large bowl and add warm
  water to cover.  Soak the noodles until they become limp and white,
  about 15 minutes.  Drain and set aside. You should have about 5 cups
  softened noodles.  In a large clay pot or flameproof, heavy-bottomed
  casserole, heat the oil over medium heat until hot, about 1 minute.
  Add the pesto and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute, adding a
  little more oil if it sticks or burns.  Add the ginger and shrimp and
  stir-fry for 1 minute. Toss in the green onion, turning the mixture
  once more. Transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside while you
  prepare the noodles and sauce. In a small bowl, combine the chicken
  stock, fish sauce (Nam Pla), oyster sauce, rice wine, soy sauce,
  sesame oil, sugar and salt; stir to mix well. Place the soaked
  noodles in the clay pot in which you cooked the shrimp mixture.

      Title: CLAY POTS FOR COOKING
 Categories: Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  It's a great way to cook. I'd seen these Romertopfs at sales for
  years. One day, probably because picking were slim that particular
  day,
  
  I bought one++a nice big one that will hold a small turkey. I had been
  missing out.  They aren't just fad items. They produce excellent
  dishes. Meats cooked in 'em don't dry out.
  
  HOW IT WORKS:
  
  Clay is a porous material.  When the pot is saturated with water and
  put into the oven, there is a slow evaporation of steam from within
  the pores of the clay itself. During the cooking process, the food
  forms its own juices.  These juices cannot escape until the pot is
  completely dry.
  
  Fortunately, when the pot becomes dry, the food is cooked!
  
  Because wet clay does not become as hot as metal, it is necessary to
  cook at a higher temperature than is usual, (450F rather than the
  customary 350F). However, in spite of this high temperature, the
  danger of burning is minimal and can only take place if the food is
  cooked for too long a period of time.
  
  As a general rule, if you add 100 degrees F. and 30 minutes to the
  cooking time of any recipe, it can be adapted for use in a clay pot.
  For instance, if you normally cook a 3 pound chicken at 350F for 1
  hour, you will need to cook it in a clay pot at 450F for 1
      1/2    hours.
  
  The manufacturers of clay pots recommend that they always be placed
  in a cold oven.  However, in an emergency, I have occasionally put
  the pot into a pre-heated 350F oven and it did not crack nor did the
  food come to any harm.  It is also possible to reheat food in a clay
  pot.
  
  Soak the lid in cold water for 10 minutes, cover the pot and pop it
  back into a 350F oven for 30 minutes.
  
  CLEANING THE POT:
  
  As you discover the almost miraculous results of cooking in clay, you
  will be using your pot with greater and greater frequency and it will
  quickly lose its brand new appearance. Though the pot goes through a
  short period of adolescence when it looks slightly mottled, it
  eventually acquires a character of its own and you begin to find
  yourself less concerned about the odd blemishes which refuse to budge
  in spite of the most desperate scrubbing.
  
  The pot is, in fact, very easy to clean because food will not stick
  to the surface (unless, of course, you burn it on). Simply let the
  pot cool after it has been taken from the oven and soak it in warm
  water for a few minutes.  Sprinkle the pot with salt and scour it
  with a stiff brush. Rinse the pot and let it drain until it is dry.
  (As clay is porous, it is not wise to clean it with detergents or
  scouring powder.)
  
  I have heard it said that you need a separate clay pot for cooking
  fish, but I have not found this to be so, in fact I have been unable
  to detect any lingering flavors or odors even after it has been used
  for the spiciest of recipes.  However if you do feel any concern over
  the matter, you can soak the pot in hot water adding three
  tablespoons of baking soda to each quart of water.  This will clean
  it very thoroughly and even small black scorch dots can be coaxed
  from the clay with the minimum of effort.
  
  Store the pot as you would any other utensil.  It is considerably less
  fragile than it appears, and unless you drop it on the floor, it will
  survive many accidental knocks and bumps without complaint. Do take
  the precaution of storing the lid alongside, rather than on top of
  the pot. This eliminates the risk of the development of mold inside
  the pot in case it was not completely dry.

      Title: CLAYLIKE BAKERS MIX
 Categories: Kids, Crafts
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 c  Flour
      1    Scant cup table salt
    3/4 c  Water
      1 oz Glycerine - optional
           Liquid food coloring - opt.
 
    SOURCE:  Posted on Delphi Cust 229 by Lynne Sammon (MICROWIZ) in
  7/95. MM format by Ursula R. Taylor.
    Mix together the flour and salt; add water while stirring. If using
  glycerine, cut water slightly.  If adding liquid color also adjust
  water. Knead until smooth and workable for 5 to 10 minutes.
    This is very, very flexible - it can be flattened, cut, rolled,
  braided, layered, squeezed through garlic press, cut with cookie
  cutters, pressed into molds, pinched, coiled, or whatever you can
  think of to do.
    When baked, this becomes extremely hard, similar to ceramic clay.
  The temperature and time depend on the thickness of design and
  materials added to basic dough. Some items with bulk should be baked
  in a 350~ oven for 1 hour.  cookie type flattened items need long
  slow drying -- use low temp (150~) overnight -- about 8 hours.

      Title: CLEANING FRESH CRABS
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Info
 
      1    Information
 
  Here's what Ken Hom has to say about cleaning fresh crabs. Just one
  point that he overlooks...  I can't bring myself to cook or dismember
  a live animal.  In another book it says that a crab can be killed
  instantly and painlessly by stabbing through the shell just behind
  the eyes.
  
  Cracking and Cleaning a Live Crab
  
  As soon as a crab (or any shellfish) is killed, it starts to lose
  flavor. To preserve the full freshness and taste, crab must be cut up
  just before cooking. Once you eat crab prepared this way, you will
  never want to go back to precooked crab.  The texture and flavor are
  worlds apart. West Coast Dungeness crab, used here, is meatier and
  sweeter than the blue crabs caught in eastern waters.  Their
  structures are identical, however, so the technique is the same for
  both. To keep from getting pinched, hold the crab from the back or
  wear thick gloves.  The cracked and cleaned crab pieces can be
  stir-fried or steamed.  If you can't imagine yourself cutting up a
  live crab, steam it for 5 minutes first then cut it up as described
  here.
  
  [The following steps are illustrated with photos in the book, but I
  think you'll be able to get the idea. S.C.]
  
  1.  Always hold the crab at the back to avoid the large pincers.
  
  2.  Twist off the large pincers.  Then break off the rest of the
  smaller legs.  Scrub the shells clean under running water.
  
  3.  Pull the large top shell off the crab in one piece. Set it aside.
  
  4.  Pull off the feathery lungs and rinse the crab's body clean under
  running water.
  
  5.  On the bottom of the crab, find the "tail", a piece of shell that
  is folded against the crab's bottom. Pull this tail away from the
  body.
  
  6.  Removing the tail exposes the inside of the crab. Rinse it out.
  
  7.  In the large shell, near the mouth, there is a small dark sac.
  Remove it with a spoon, being careful not to break it. Don't remove
  the yellowish-brown "crab butter" from the shell, which has a rich
  flavor.
  
  8.  Cut the body in quarters.
  
  9.  Crack the claws by tapping them with a cleaver, or by placing a
  cleaver on top of the claw and hitting the back of the cleaver with
  the heel of the hand. [Place the cleaver's flat side on top of the
  claw. S.C.]
  
  10.  Cut the tips off the legs.
  
  11.  Crack the legs one by one.  Turn each leg so that the edge is up,
  enabling you to tap the shell with the side of a cleaver just hard
  enough to crack the shell, but not so hard as to crush the fragile
  meat.

  cilantro and stir. Chill salsa overnight before using. Serve as a dip
  for chips or as a spicy topping on your favorite Mexican or Tex-Mex
  food. Makes about a quart of salsa. Note: This makes a medium hot
  salsa. Your lips will tingle a little but it won't make your eyeballs
  bleed. Adjust the amount of ancho to the desired heat level or add
  another kind of hot pepper such as serrano or jalapeno to give it a
  heat boost.

 Categories: Side dishes, Vegetables, Cyberealm, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Bell pepper, green, chopped
      1 lg Bell pepper, red, chopped
      1 md Onion, chopped
      1 lg Tomato, sliced into rounds
      1 c  Mozzarella cheese, shredded
           (Use more or less to taste)
 
  Sprinkle cheese on rolled out pizza pie (1/2 recipe of Marty's pizza
  dough). Tope with chopped peppers and onions, cover with round tomato
  slices. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook for about 20 to 25
  minutes on 450 degrees, or until crust is brown and cheese melted. (I
  omit pizza sauce for this one. If you've never tried it... try it
  just once, you might be surprised how good it is without sauce. Make
  sure the pizza is completely covered with vegetables, sometimes I use
  very finely chopped broccoli with this as well, and if I feel
  adventurous, jalapeno peppers).

      Title: CLOOTIE DUMPLING
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 oz Plain flour
      3 oz Shredded suet (usually
           -available at your butcher)
      3 oz Currants (dark raisins)
      1 oz Sultanas (white raisins)
      2 oz To 3 oz castor sugar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    3/4 c  Buttermilk or sour milk
 
  Mix flour with suet, fruit, sugar, cinnamon and soda. Stir in enough
  milk to make a soft batter. Dip a pudding cloth (cheesecloth) into
  boiling water, sink it in a basin large enough to hold the batter.
  Dredge it lightly with flour and spoon in the batter. Draw the
  fullness of the cloth together evenly, then tie it tightly with
  string, but leave enough room for the dumpling to swell. Place a
  saucer or plate in the bottom of a large saucepan. Lift the dumpling
  into the pan. Pour in enough boiling water to cover. Simmer for a
  full 2 hours, then untie. Turn out carefully onto a hot serving dish.
  Dredge with castor sugar. Serve with hot custard sauce. Yields 4 to 6
  servings.
  
  For the hot custard sauce, we usually use Byrd's Custard. If you have
  the availability of British goods in your area, they should have
  Byrd's custard. It comes in a large tin, like a container of powdered
  chocolate for chocolate milk. Just follow the directions to make a
  custard, only dilute it a little more to make it sauce-like.

      Title: CLOTTED CREAM
 Categories: Dairy
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     20 fl Heavy whipping cream
      2 qt Milk (or more)*
 
  *Preferably extra-rich milk, if you can get it in your area. Choose a
  wide-mouthed bowl or stainless steel bowl with sloping sides. Fill it
  with milk, leaving a deep enough rim free to avoid spillage. Add 20
  fl double cream.  Leave in the refrigerator for at least several
  hours, and preferably overnight.  Set the bowl over a pan of water
  kept at 82 degrees C (180 F) and leave until the top of the milk is
  crusted with a nubbly yellowish-cream surface.  This will take at
  least 1 1/2 hours, but it is prudent to allow much longer. Take the
  bowl from the pan and cool it rapidly in a bowl of ice water, then
  store in the refrigerator until very cold.  Take the crust off with a
  skimmer, and put it into another bowl with a certain amount of the
  creamy liquid underneath; it is surprising how much the clotted part
  firms up -- it needs the liquid.  You can now put the milk back over
  the heat for a second crust to form, and add that in its turn to the
  first one. The milk left over makes the most delicious rice pudding,
  or can be used in baking, especially of yeast buns.

      Title: CLOTTED CREAM PART 1
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
 
     Clotted cream is a traditional product of South West England and
  the traditional farmhouse method of manufacture is as follows:
  
  1.  Channel Island milk is placed in shallow pans or bowls and left
  until the cream rises to the top.
  
  2.  The milk is then scalded for about one hour by placing the pan or
  bowl over a pan of water maintained at a temperature of about 180^F
  (82^C).
  
  3.  The cream is ready when it is straw colored and wrinkled in
  appearance. It is then cooled overnight or for about twelve hours.
  
  4.  When cool the cream should be skimmed off the surface using a
  perforated skimmer or a shallow spoon.
  
  5.  If the skimmed cream is left in the refrigerator for a few hours
  it will thicken further.
  
     Alternatively, clotted cream can be made using the direct scald
  method. Double cream is placed in shallow pans or bowls and scalded
  as for the traditional method. After scalding and cooling the whole
  contents of the pan are used as clotted cream.

  spices. Melt the butter or vegetable fat gently with the treacle. Mix
  the breadcrumbs, currants and sultanas. Beat the egg and milk
  together and add to the dry ingredients, with the grated carrot and
  apple - use you hands. Add more milk if necessary to give a soft
  mixture which drops easily from the spoon. Put a square of cotton
  sheet in the pot of boiling water with an upturned plate on the
  bottom. Take out the scalded cloth, spinkle it with flour and put in
  the dumpling. Draw up the edges, and tie up firmly with white string,
  leaving enough room for the pudding to expand. Lower the dumpling
  back into the boiling pan. Keep water topped up. Bring back to the
  boil. Boil steadily but gently for 4 hours. It can be longer but it
  shouldn't be less. Remove the dumpling and dip it staight in and out
  of cold water.  Unwrap the dumpling on to a serving plate. The skin
  will initially be white from the flour. Put the dumpling on its plate
  in a very low oven to dry off for 20 minutes, when it will develop a
  fine, dark glossy skin. Meanwhile, make the ginger cream. Beat the
  wine with the egg yolks over hot water until the mixture is thick,
  white and fluffy. Stir in 1/4 pint single cream. Serve it in a pretty
  glass jug, with the hot pudding. The dumpling cuts wonderfully rich
  and dark. Leftover slices are delicious fried in butter - lovely with
  cream for a special tea-time treat.

    1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 ts Minced garlic
           Salt and fresh pepper
  2 1/2 lb Ground chuck
    3/4 c  Grated carrots
    1/3 c  Ketchup
      1 ts Dry mustard
 
  1. Combine the oatmeal, honey and milk in a large mixing bowl. Allow
  to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F.
  
  2. Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat and add the onion and
  garlic. Add salt and pepper to taste, and saute until the onion is
  translucent and softened slightly.
  
  3. Add the onion to the oatmeal mixture, along with the meat, add
  salt to taste, and plenty of black pepper. Add the grated carrots,
  mix thoroughly, and place in a non-stick 9 x 5 x 3 loaf pan. (If
  using a regular loaf pan, oil it lightly.) Place the loaf pan on a
  cookie sheet to catch any spills and put in oven. (Typist's note: I
  used a bundt pan and it works much better -- no boil over of grease).
  
  4. Bake the meatloaf for 50 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully
  tip the pan to drain off the excess fat and liquid, and then turn the
  meatloaf out onto the cookie sheet. Turn right side up. Combine the
  ketchup and mustard and spread the mixture over the top of the
  meatloaf. Return meatloaf to the oven and bake for an additional 20
  minutes.

      Title: COACH'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP BBQ CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Whole chickens (Tyson)
     24 oz Italian salad dressing,
           Wishbone
      1 lb Head Country BBQ spice
      3 c  Coach's BBQ Sauce
      1 ga Zip lock bag
 
  Put two whole chickens in a gallon zip lock bag with a 24 oz. bottle
  of Wishbone Italian Salad Dressing. Seal the bag and refrigerate
  overnight. Remove from bag and pat dry. Sprinkle the spice over the
  chicken inside and out.  Place chicken in the smoker and cook for 5
  hours or until done. Every hour brush on a lemon mop ( see recipe).
  If you are grilling the chicken, brush on more often. At the four
  hour mark brush the BBQ sauce over the chicken, repeat every 30
  minutes till chicken is done. This recipe works well with chicken
  halves or chicken breasts. Also you can grill the chicken pieces.
  Leave the skin on while grilling so the chicken will not dry out. Put
  the BBQ sauce on the last 10 to 15 minutes of grilling. Otherwise the
  chicken will burn if the BBQ sauce has tomatoes or sugar in it. Also,
  if you cook pieces of chicken DO NOT marinate them more then 3 to
        4    hours.

      Title: COARSE-GROUND MUSTARD WITH HONEY & TARRAGON
 Categories: Condiments, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Mustards, Spreads
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/2 c  Mustard seed; light or dark
      3 tb Dry mustard powder*
           -- lightly packed
    2/3 c  ;Water
    3/4 c  White wine vinegar or
    3/4 c  Oriental rice vinegar
      3 tb Mild-flavored honey or
      2 tb White corn syrup plus
      1 tb Strongly flavored honey
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Chopped fresh tarragon** or
      2 ts Dried tarragon; crumbled
 
  *Preferably Colman's.
  
  **Or more to taste of either the fresh or dried tarragon.
  
  If using a spice mill, grind the mustard seed in it to the texture of
  coarse meal.  Stir the ground seed with the mustard powder and water
  and set it aside, uncovered, for at least 2 hours or as long as
  overnight, giving it a stir when you think of it.
  
  If using a blender or food processor to do the grinding, combine the
  seed, mustard powder and water in the container; process everything
  to a coarse puree.  Set the mixture aside as described.
  
  Combine the mustard mixture with the vinegar, honey, salt and
  tarragon. Process the mixture in a blender or food processor to the
  texture that suits you, from slightly coarse to creamy.
  
  Store in a clean, dry jar, tightly capped, at room temperature if you
  would like it to mellow gradually, or refrigerate it at once to
  retain maximum hotness. It can be used at once, but a few days' rest
  in the jar will allow the flavor to develop.  After the mustard has
  rested for a day or two, taste it and decide whether to add more
  tarragon, honey or vinegar. Good with summer picnic foods.
  
  Yield: About 2 cups.  Keeps indefinitely, either at room temperature
  or in the refrigerator.

    3/4 c  White wine vinegar or
    3/4 c  Oriental rice vinegar
      3 tb Mild-flavored honey or
      2 tb White corn syrup plus
      1 tb Strongly flavored honey
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Chopped fresh tarragon** or
      2 ts Dried tarragon; crumbled
 
  *Preferably Colman's.
  
  **Or more to taste of either the fresh or dried tarragon.
  
  If using a spice mill, grind the mustard seed in it to the texture of
  coarse meal.  Stir the ground seed with the mustard powder and water
  and set it aside, uncovered, for at least 2 hours or as long as
  overnight, giving it a stir when you think of it.
  
  If using a blender or food processor to do the grinding, combine the
  seed, mustard powder and water in the container; process everything
  to a coarse puree.  Set the mixture aside as described.
  
  Combine the mustard mixture with the vinegar, honey, salt and
  tarragon. Process the mixture in a blender or food processor to the
  texture that suits you, from slightly coarse to creamy.
  
  Store in a clean, dry jar, tightly capped, at room temperature if you
  would like it to mellow gradually, or refrigerate it at once to
  retain maximum hotness. It can be used at once, but a few days' rest
  in the jar will allow the flavor to develop.  After the mustard has
  rested for a day or two, taste it and decide whether to add more
  tarragon, honey or vinegar. Good with summer picnic foods.
  
  Yield: About 2 cups.  Keeps indefinitely, either at room temperature
  or in the refrigerator.

      Title: COATING FOR YOUR THANKSGIVING TURKEY
 Categories: Chicken, Condiments, Poultry, Holiday
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Paprika
           Salt
           Garlic powder
           Onion; dried
           Pepper
           Water; to make paste
 
  This will do about a 13-15lb turkey.  Other seasonings are to taste. I
  never did measure. This is a coating you can put on all poultry before
  roasting.  Basically you make a paste of the above ingredients. It
  should be the consistencey of finger paint--thick and not runny. If
  you have kids, put them in old clothes and let them help. I smear it
  in and out of the cavity. Notice that this does not have any Gravy
  Master or oil...both unneeeded in my opinion. The skin cooks nice and
  crisp. Remember to baste during cooking. BTW, use this in the Nuke
  too.
   Sometimes we do a turkey or chicken in there when we have lot's of
  other baking/roasting to do.  When Howard was in training to be a
  Chef, he brought home a bunch of fellow students for dinner. Not one
  of them even came close to guessing that the turkey had been made in
  the nuke. I hope all of you have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.

  knife.  Combine sugar, mustards, bread crumbs, and enough Coke to
  form a thick paste. Place ham on roasting rack in pan and pat all

  Increase the temperature to 375oF and bake the ham 45 minutes longer,
  basting every 20 to 15 minutes until sugar-mustard paste has melted
  to a dark glaze. Let stand at room temperature
       30    minutes before slicing.

      Title: COCA-COLA RIBS
 Categories: Barbeque, Marinades, Bbq sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 lb Pork Ribs
      3 c  Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper
      3 c  Ketchup
      1 c  Packed Dark Brown Sugar
      6 tb Chili Powder
      4 tb Ground black pepper
      2 tb Dry mustard
      1 tb Ground cinnamon
 
  Transfer the ribs to a large non-reactive glass or ceramic dish pour
  2 cups of Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper over them. Reserve the third cup of
  the soda for a sauce to be made later. Let the ribs marinate, tightly
  covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated, overnight.
  
  About 6 1/2 hours before you plan to serve the ribs, start a fire in
  your smoke/cooker and begin heating a quantity of coals. Then turn
  your attention to the sauce.
  
  Pour the remaining 1 cup of soda into a blender or food processor and
  measure in the catsup, brown sugar, chili powder, pepper, dry
  mustard, and cinnamon.  Mix until smooth and well blended. No need to
  cook this one, as least for now.
  
  Add some well-soaked aromatic wood such as hickory or mesquite to the
  glowing coals in your cooker.  Set a pan filled with hot water in
  place, and smoke cook the ribs, covered at 220 to 240 degrees F. for
  about 3 hours.
  
  After this initial smoking, turn the ribs, slather them with the
  sauce, check the supply of wood and water in their respective pans,
  and continue cooking for another 3 hours, this time turning the ribs
  every 30 minutes and mopping them with sauce each time they're
  turned. By the end of the 3 hours, they should have long since
  reached the internal temperature of 160 to 170 degrees recommended
  for pork.
  
  After the last basting of the ribs, tote the remaining sauce inside
  and simmer in a medium-size saucepan over low heat until quite thick.
  
  Serve the gloriously gooey sauce in dipping bowls with the finished
  ribs.

      1    Small coconut
      5    Small eggs, separated
           Pinch   salt
           Flan mold coated with
           Caramel
 
       Preheat the oven to 450F.
  
       Place the sugar and milk in a heavy saucepan and melt the sugar
  over low heat, then raise the heat and boil the mixture briskly. Take
  care that it does not boil over. As soon as the mixture begins to
  thicken, stir it so that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan.
  After about 30 minutes it should be the consistency of thin condensed
  milk and has been reduced to 1 cup.  See Note.
  
       Pierce holes through two of the "eyes" of the coconut and drain
  the water from it.  Set the water aside.
  
       Put the whole coconut into the oven for about 8 minutes. Crack it
  open; the flesh should come away quite easily from the shell.
  
       Pare the brown skin from the coconut flesh with a potato peeler.
  Grate the coconut finely.  You will need 2 1/4 cups, loosely packed,
  for the flan.
  
       Add the grated coconut to the reserved coconut water and boil it
  for about 5 minutes, stirring it constantly.
  
       Add the "condensed" milk and continue cooking for another 5
  minutes. Set the mixture aside to cool.
  
       Beat the egg yolks together until they are creamy and stir them
  well into the coconut mixture.
  
       Beat the egg whites until they are frothy, add the salt and
  continue beating until they are stiff. Fold them into the mixture.
  
       Pour the mixture into the prepared mold.  Cover the mold with a
  well-greased lid and place into a water bath.
  
       Cook the flan on the lowest shelf of the oven for about 1 1/2
  hours, then test to see if it is done. When it is done, set it aside
  to cool.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  NOTES:
       Of course, you can substitute1 cup of lightly thinned canned,
  sweetened condensed milk for the milk and sugar and substitute
  pre-grated but unsweetened coconut. Use milk instead of coconut
  water; the flavor will just not be quite as good.
  
       Do not think you have done something wrong when you see that the
  coconut and custard have separated. That is how it is meant to be. The
  caramel will nearly all have been absorbed by the spongy layer of
  coconut.
  
       If you are using fresh coconut there will almost certainly be
  some left over.  It will keep perfectly well if frozen.
  
       To test to see if the flan is cooked through, insert the blade
  of a knife or a skewer well into the flan. The knife should come out
  clean. Take care not to pierce the flan at the bottom or it will
  spoil the appearance of the top when it is unmolded.

      Title: COCHINITA PIBIL
 Categories: Meats, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           ONE DAY AHEAD:
  3 1/2 lb (to 4-1/2) pork --
           Preferably
           End of loin -- with fat
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Seville orange juice (see
           Note)
           Spice grinder
      1 tb Achiote seeds (heaping)
    1/4 ts Cumin seeds
    1/4 ts Oregano
     12    Peppercorns
      3    Whole allspice
     40    Milliliters Garlic -- peeled
    1/8 ts Powdered chile seco (may
           Substitute hot paprika)
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Seville orange juice -or-
           Mild white vinegar
      2 lg Pieces banana leaf
           ON SERVING DAY:
           Dutch oven
           The wrapped meat
    1/2 c  Cold water
           SALSA:
    1/2 c  Onion -- very finely
           Chopped
      3    Chiles habaneros -- very
           Finely chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Seville orange juice
 
  Pierce the pork all over and rub in the 2 teaspoons salt and 2
  tablespoons orange juice. Set aside while you prepare the seasoning
  paste.
  
  Grind the achiote seeds, cumin, oregano, peppercorns and allspice
  together to a fine powder.
  
  Crush the garlic together with the chile seco, salt and 3 tablespoons
  Seville orange juice and mix with other powdered spices. The mixture
  should be a thick paste. Coat the pork with the paste.
  
  Lightly sear the banana leaves over a bare flame to make them more
  flexible. Wrap the meat up in them and leave to season in the
  refrigerator for at least six hours or overnight. ON SERVING DAY:
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place a rack at the bottom of the Dutch
  oven and cover the dish with a tight fitting lid. Cook for 2 1/2
  hours. Turn the meat and baste it well with the juices at the bottom
  of the pot. Cook for another 2 1/2 hours, or until the meat is soft
  and falling off the bone.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the salsa: mix all ingredients together. Set aside
  to season for about 2 hours. Serve in a separate dish.
  
  After cooking, shred the meat roughly. Pour the fat and juices from
  the pan over it. Serve hot, with tortillas and the sauce so that each
  person can make his or her own tacos.
  
  NOTE: A rough approximation of Seville orange juice may be attained
  through the following: For 1/2 cup blended juice, combine 1 teaspoon
  finely grated grapefruit rind, 3 tablespoons orange juice, 3
  tablespoons grapefruit juice and 2 tablespoons lemon juice.

      Title: COCK-A-LEEKIE
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8    Pieces of frying chicken (A
           -3 to 4-pound chicken should
           -do it.)
 
  Cock-a-Leekie
  
  A pound of beef shanks, hacked into stewing size (about 1") 6 cups of
  chicken stock.  (Canned is ok, but it's better if you make your own
  ahead of time.) 3 slices of thick bacon or maybe salt pork, diced
  pretty fine. 1 Tblsp dried thyme.  (Whole is better!) 1 bay leaf 3/4
  cup pearl barley. (The kind you use in soup.) 1 1/2 cups of leeks.
  (Rinse and chop white parts only.) Salt and pepper as you require.
  
  You're going to need an 8-quart or better casserole that can stand up
  to the stove burners.  Bring the whole thing to a boil, (leave out
  the barley, leeks, salt and pepper.) Simmer covered for 30 minutes.
  Meanwhile, in another part of the forest, bring the barley to a boil
  in 1 1/2 cups of water for 10 min., drain and set it aside. Debone
  the chicken when it's done and set it aside. Add the leeks to the pot
  along with the barley and simmer for 15 minutes. (Still with me?)
  Then debone the beef and chop coarsely.  Dump the beef and the
  chicken back in the pot and simmer, covered, for 5 min. Garnish with
  chopped fresh parsley. Sing "Men of Harlech."   Pour a single malt.
  Serve.
  
  And, if you're not up to Cock-a-Leekie ... In "A Moveable Feast" (sic)
  Ernest Hemingway offers the following leek recipe: Trim leeks,
  leaving just a smidgen of green and rinse them. Steam them for about
  20 minutes or boil them for about the same time, until they are
  reasonably tender. Meanwhile, mix equal parts of extra-virgin olive
  oil and wine vinegar with a whisk in a bowl. When leeks are cooked,
  cut into quarters lengthwise and put them in a bowl of the
  oil/vinegar mix. They should be just covered by the mix. Cover the
  bowl and put in refrigimagrator for an hour or so. (Overnight is even
  better, but St. David's Day is already upon us.) Then dust them with
  a healthy dose of fresh-ground pepper and serve as a salad or side
  dish.

      Title: COCKENTRICE (A MARVELOUS BEAST)
 Categories: Chicken, Pork, Medieval
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Suckling pig, about 7 pounds
      1 lg Roasting chicken, about 6
           -pounds
      6    Egg yolks
    1/4 ts Powdered saffron
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  White wine
      1 tb Fresh parsley leaves,
           -very finely chopped
      1 tb Flour
 
  "The extraordinary "beasts" created by these instructions never were
  seen on land or sea.  A bestiary pair, these chicken and pork visual
  as well as edible delights were intended to startle as well as feed.
  The creation of such illusion foods was an important contribution of
  the medieval cook to the flamboyant art forms of the medieval feast."
  
  Bake the chicken and the suckling pig separately at 375 F until
  tender; the chicken ought to take 2 hours, the suckling pig closer to
  3 hours.
  
  Cut the chicken in half with the incision running around the body
  behind the wings.  The forward half is thus separated from the
  hindparts. Similarly cleave the pig so that the "head and shoulders"
  are cut from the back half of the animal.  With a strong butcher's
  thread or "carpet" thread sew the forward half of the chicken to the
  back half of the pig; sew the pig's "head and shoulders" to the hind
  half of the capon. Each is now a cockentrice.  Turn oven up to 400F.
  
  Lightly beat the egg yolks.  Mix in the saffron and flour to make a
  thick fluid.  Paint this on the suture lines as well as various parts
  of either the "face" or appendages--gold snout and gold nails were
  typical adornments.
  
  Return these marvelous animals to the oven so the gold "endoring" may
  set and the final creatures appear resplendent.
  
  Mix the parsley in white wine with flour until the green color well
  permeates the fluid.  If not a bright green, add two drops of green
  food coloring.  Paint on "feathers" or designs for final embellishing
  of the cockentrice, your fancy guiding your hand.

      Title: COCKLE CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups, Seafood, British
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 pt Cockles, well washed
      4 sl Bacon, chopped
      1 oz Butter
      1    Spanish onion, chopped
      3    Floury potatoes, cubed
    3/4 pt Milk
      4 tb Chopped parsley
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Take a large pan with a lid and put a little water in it to boil. When
  boiling, toss in the cockles, clap the lid on and cook 5 mins or so,
  shaking to cook the cockles evenly. When they have all opened, tip
  into a colander over a bowl. Remove cockles forthwith from their
  shells, and spread out to cool quickly. Strain the liquor carefully
  to remove and sand.
  
  Meanwhile parboil the potatoes for about 10 minutes, and in another
  pan, melt the butter, let the bacon sizzle in it a moment or two, add
  the finely chopped onion, put the lid on and sweat till the onion
  becomes transparent. Add the milk, cockle liquor, potatoes and bring
  to the boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook very gently till the
  potatoes are soft but not a total mush. If you cook too quickly, or
  the potatoes are not properly parcooked, the milk will curdle. It
  isn't serious, just less attractive.
  
  Chop the cockles roughly, add them to the soup, pepper it and add the
  parsley. Taste for saltiness, (it shouldn't need any as the bacon and
  cockles are both naturally salty.

      3 oz Rye flakes
      3 oz Jumbo oat flakes
      3 oz Barley flakes
      3 oz Wheat flakes
      3 oz Peanut kernals
           -- not salted or dry-roast
      2 oz Flaked almonds
      2 oz Sunflower seeds
      1 ts (heaped) coriander seeds
      1 ts (heaped) cumin seeds
      1 tb Garam marsala
      1 ts Tumeric
      3 tb Sesame oil
      3 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Soy sauce
      5 tb Water
 
  Crush the coriander and cumin - lightly.  Mix them with the nuts and
  seeds on two baking trays.  Set the oven to 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5
  and put the baking trays into the oven while it heats up. Meanwhile
  measure the flaked grains and mix them together in a large bowl. Put
  into a cup the garam marsala, tumeric, a good grinding of black
  pepper, a scrunch of sea salt, the soy, both sorts of oil and the
  water.
  
  When the oven has reached the required temperature, stir the nut and
  seed mixture with the flaked grains. Beat the spicy oil-and-water
  mixture with a fork to emulsify it, pour it on to the dry ingredients
  and stir for 2 minutes.  Spread the mixture out on to the baking
  trays and bake for 40 minutes until golden. Swap the positions of the
  trays in the oven at least once during this time and stir the mixture
  occasionally to encourage even cooking.  Let the mixture become cold
  and crunchy before storing in an airtight jar.  It keeps well for
  about a month.  Makes enough to fill one jar.

    1/4 lb Margarine (one stick)
  1 1/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
      1 c  Coconut, shredded
  1 1/4 c  Chocolate chips
  1 3/4 c  Condensed milk,
           -sweetened (1 can)
 
  Melt the margarine in a 9x13-inch pan.  Combine with graham cracker
  crumbs and spread evenly on bottom of pan. Sprinkle coconut evenly
  over crumbs. Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over coconut. Pour
  condensed milk evenly over everything. Bake for 30 minutes at

  Let cool for a bit.  Cut into squares and enjoy.  Mom insists on using
  "Borden Eagle Brand" sweetened condensed milk. Don't ask me why.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A nicely fattening combination of coconut and chocolate chips --
  This comes from Mom. (She doesn't know where she got it; she
  memorized it years ago and lost the original recipe.) It's always
  been a favorite with us kids, and last time I was home she gave me
  the recipe. It's so simple that even a complete clutz like myself was
  able to make it perfectly the first time.
  
  : Difficulty:  trivial.

  1 2/3 c  Flour
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Cocoa powder

      2 tb Fat-free egg substitute
           (can use egg whites)
    1/4 c  Chocolate syrup
      2 ts Almond extract
 
  1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa and baking powder
  and stir to mix well. Add the almonds if desired and stir to mix. Add
  the remaining ingredients and stir just until the dough holds
  together.
  
  2. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape into two 8
  x 2 inch logs. (If the dough is too sticky to handle, knead in a
  little more flour.) Flatten out the logs a little bit or else the
  crust will split and crack. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking
  spray and place the logs on the sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for
  about 23 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer the logs to a
  wire rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
  
  3. Place the logs on a cutting board and use a serrated knife to
  slice the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place the
  slices on a baking sheet and bake at 300 degrees F for 20 minutes or
  until lightly browned, turning after 10 minutes.
  
  4. Transfer the biscotti to wire racks and cool completely. Serve
  immediately or store in an airtight container.
  
  NOTE: These are very easy to make and taste great. I made them
  without the almonds, so there were even less fat and calories.
