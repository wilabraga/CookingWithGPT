  store). Grind, with the chiles and parsley, very fine. In a skillet,
  with 1/4 C cooking oil, add a little of the chicken stock. Add the
  green chile mixture and stir well, then add the remaining chicken

      Title: EL HAM LAHLOU (SWEET LAMB FOR RAMADHAN)
 Categories: Lamb, Algerian, Holiday
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 tb Butter
      1 lb Lamb; in 3-inch pieces
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
      3 c  Water
    1/4 c  Sugar
     12    Dried prunes soaked in water
           -for one hour
      2 tb White raisins
      2 tb Whole blanched almonds
      1    Firm pear; peel/core/wedges
      2 tb Orange blossom water
 
  The holy celebration of Ramadhan is when the Algerian Muslims eat this
  sweet lamb after a day of fasting. It is almost a dessert meat, with
  raisins, prunes, sugar, almonds and orange blossom water, and it is
  cooked without salt, to prevent thirst the next day for those fasting.
  
  1. Melt the butter in a pan, add the lamb and saute over low heat for
  5 minutes. Add the cinnamon, water and sugar and mix well. Increase
  the heat to moderate and cook for about 40 minutes, or until the meat
  is tender. The sauce will darken.
  
  2. Drain the prunes and add them to the lamb with the raisins,
  almonds and pear. Simmer for 15 minutes more. Remove the pan from the
  heat and stir in the orange blossom water.
  
  Serve at room temperature with rice, salad and bread. Serves 4 to 6
  with other dishes.

  Delicious! It contains several Mexican ingredients such as pumpkin
  seeds (pepitas) and Cotija cheese, which are available in Mexican
  markets and some supermarkets. --Susan Watts, Palm Dessert
  
  Update: Oct 1996 the restaurant is making roasted red pepper
  tortillas. The salad had fresh red and green bell pepper dice that
  has been marinating in the dressing. COTIJA, also known as ANEJO, is
  a salty, crumbly white cheese, similar to feta in appearance. But
  cotija is hard enough to put into a blender. Romano or washed and
  dried feta are good substitutes. Cotija is hard white cheese that can
  be grated. Other substitutes are Cacique, manchego, panela, or
  Parmesan. The cheese must have character.)patH(
  
  MAKE THE DRESSING:  Place chili, pepitas, garlic, pepper, salt, oil,
  vinegar and Cotija cheese in blender or food processor. Blend about 10
  seconds, then add cilantro, bit by bit,until smoothly blended.
  
  Place mayonnaise and water in large stainless-steel bowl and whisk
  until smooth. Add blended chili mixture and mix thoroughly. Place in
  an airtight container and refrigerate; dressing may be stored up to 3
  days. Makes about 3 cups.
  
  MAKE THE SALAD:  Cut tortillas into matchstick-size strips. Heat oil
  for deep frying and add tortilla strips. Cook a few seconds until
  crisp. Remove and drain. Set aside.
  
  Tear romaine lettuce into bite-size pieces. Place greens on 6 salad
  plates and ladle Cilantro-Pepita Dressing on each salad. Sprinkle
  each dish with Cotija cheese and tortilla strips. Arrange 4 red
  pepper strips like spokes on top of each salad and garnish with
  pepitas.

  My favorite, and well worth the effort. Masa harina comes in a bag
  like flour and can be found with the flour in most supermarkets. It's
  the flour to use for corn tortillas. The recipe doubles easily and
  turns out well with either of the two methods provided. -- Ann Weeks,

 Categories: Cheesecake, Cyberealm, Kooknet, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar, granulated
      2 lb Cream Cheese
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Sour Cream
      1 ts Vanilla
      3 tb Cornstarch
      1 c  Graham Cracker Crumbs
    1/4 c  Butter or Margarine
  1 1/4 c  Oreo Cookie Crumbs
    1/4 c  Butter or Margarine
      3 tb Sugar, granulated
 
  :       In a small bowl, blend well the graham cracker crumbs, butter
  or margarine, and 3 tablespoons granulated sugar. Press the crumb
  mixture in the bottom of a greased 8" or 9" springform pan. Place the
  pan in the freezer to chill while you prepare the filling.
  :       In a mixer bowl, mix the cream cheese and sugar until smooth
  and light. I, myself, mix alternately 8 ozs. of the cream cheese and
  1/4 cup of the sugar. This is just to ensure it is evenly mixed. When
  the cream cheese and sugar mixture is light and creamy, mix in the
  eggs, vanilla, and the cornstarch, making sure it is mixed well. It
  should be a nice light yellow color. Mix in the sour cream until well
  mixed. Pour the mixture into the prepared springform pan.
  :       Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the
  temperature to 200 degrees and bake for another 45 minutes. Turn oven
  off and allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven with the door opened
  slightly for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove sides from pan and chill in
  refrigerator for another 2 to 3 hours. Then slide the cheesecake off
  the bottom of your pan, if you wish.
  
       ** You can use the Oreo Cookie Crumbs in place of the Graham
  Cracker Crumbs for a wonderfully delightful change. (This is the way
  that most of the people order it from me.)
  
      *** Before placing the cheescake in the oven for baking, I always
  sprinkle a bit of the crumbs on top for garnish. Really looks nice!
  
     **** Last hint: I put a pan with about 2-3 inches of hot water on

      Title: ELAINE'S DOLMAS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Mcdougall, Main dish
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
     48    Grape leaves (about 1 jar)
    1/2 c  Long grain brown rice;cooked
      2 c  Onion; finely chopped
      2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
      2 tb Mint leaves; finely chopped
      2 ts Dill weed
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
    1/4 c  Currants
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1 c  Tofu TVP (optional)
 
   Place grape leves briefly in a pan of warm water to separate them,
  then drain on paper towels. Combine all other ingredients. Place
  grape leaf vein side up, with the stem toward you. Put a mound of
  rice mixture in the middle of the leaf (about 1 rounded tsp to 1
  rounded tbsp, depending on the size of the leaf). Fold over sides and
  roll up leaf. Layer the rolled leaves in a large saucepan (3 quart)
  placing them side by side and close together. Press with a heavy heat
  proof plate that fits inside the pan. Add enough boiling water to
  cover leaves. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.
  
   Hints: Dolmas may be served warm or chilled. If warm, try serving
  them with lemon sauce. If cold, serve them with garbanzo puree or
  eggplant. Tabouli is also a good dish to serve at the same meal.
  Dolmas are easy to take to a potluck dinner and they also make a very
  special "company meal." Recipe for making tofu TVP follows. The use
  of the tofu in this recipe is entirely optional; they are delicious
  both ways.

      Title: ELAINE'S POTATO LATKES
 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Jewish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Idaho's; or Russet potatoes
           -don't bother to peel
      1 lg Onion; quartered
      2    Eggs
    1/4 c  Matzo meal
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Fresh grated black pepper
           Oil; for frying
           Applesauce; homemade is best
 
  1. If you are not peeling the potatoes, it is important to SCRUB them
  well; with a veggie brush or a scotch brite pad.
  
  2. Place the onions and the eggs in a Food Processor. ZAP the mixture
  a few times until the onion is diced into crunchy bits, OR gone (Papa
  prefers it that GONE way). Pour the contents of the Food Processor
  bowl into a large bowl for mixing.
  
  3. Cut the potatoes lengthwise to fit in the FP feed tube. I use the
  medium grating blade and shred the potatoes. (Of course you can
  always use the old fashioned reib eissen method which draws blood, OY)
  
  4. When the potatoes are shredded put them in a colander over the
  sink and squeeze. Let the mixture drip for a few minutes.
  
  5. Pour the contents of the colander into the bowl with the onion and
  egg mixture.  Add  the matzo meal, and salt and pepper.
  
  6. In a large cast-iron skillet, pour in 1/4" of the oil. Over high
  heat get the oil VERY HOT.  Use a 1/4 cup measure or a long-handled
  serving spoon, start spooning the batter into the SKILLET. Flatten
  each with a metal spatula to a diameter of 3" to 4".
  
  7. Cook the latkes until golden brown on one side. Then turn over and
  fry them some more.  When crispy on the outside and moist inside,
  about 5 minutes per side, remove and place on several thickness of
  paper towels or old supermarket bags (of course they should be
  clean). Keep doing this until you run out of batter.
  
  8. Serve the latkes immediately WITH APPLESAUCE or lately my apple
  butter.
  
  NOTE: I can't make these fast enough.  The children wait all year for
  a bite, <g>!  I only make them on Pesach and Chanukah.

      2 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 tb Semolina or

      2 tb Sugar

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Elderberry jelly or
           Sprinkle of cinnamon
 
  Strip the flowers off the stems of two clusters of elderblow.  Put the
  flowers in a pan with the milk and heat to scalding; hold just below
  boiling point for several minutes to extract the flavor from the
  elderblow. Strain milk and discard flowers.
  
  Mix the sugar, salt and semolina (or tapioca) together.  Whisk in
  beaten eggs and gradually add hot milk.  Return to low heat, or cook
  over hot water, stirring constantly, until the custard coats a metal
  spoon. Remove from heat instantly and set the pan in another pan
  containing cold water to stop the cooking.  Cool slightly, then pour
  into 4 dessert dishes. Chill in the refrigerator.
  
  At serving time, make a meringue of the egg white beaten stiff with
  the sugar.  Float a spoonful of meringue in the center of each
  dessert dish and garnish with a bit of elderberry jelly or a sprinkle
  of cinnamon. This dessert has a pleasant, subtle flowery flavor.

  Mew England legend decrees that votes were bought in exchange for this
  loaf. You may not win an election, but you will get an overwhelming
  vote of confidence if you serve this bread to the poll watchers
  gathered in your home on election night.
  
  In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Add 2 tsp sugar
  and 1 1/2 cups flour.  beat well, about 150 strokes. Cover the bowl
  tightly and set in a warm, draft-free place for 30 minutes.
  Meanwhile, sift the remaining flour with the salt, cinnamon, cloves,
  and nutmeg on a piece of wax paper.  In a small bowl, cream the
  butter and sugar. When the yeast batter has only 5 more minutes to
  rise, add the eggs to the creamed butter.
  
  Beat well.  Stir down the yeast batter.  Spoon in the butter mixture
  and blend well.  Add the sifted dry ingredients a spoonful at a time,
  beating after each one until the mixture is smooth. Dredge the
  raisins, nuts and citron in the tbsp of flour and stir into the
  batter. Pour the batter into a greased 10 inch tube pan. Make it
  level by using a spoon dipped in cold water.  Cover the pan with wax
  paper and place in a warm, draft-free spot for about 1-1/2 hours, or
  until a wooden tooth-pick inserted in the center comes out clean.
  Check halfway through baking time; if the top gets too brown, cover
  loosely with foil or brown paper. Remove from oven and let cool for
  10 minutes before turning the bread onto a wire rack to cool.
  
  Spread on the icing while the bread is still warm. Makes 1 loaf.

 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Dough:
      1 c  All purpose flour
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter
      1 tb Shortening
    1/4 c  Apple juice or apple cider
           Filling:
      4 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Crushed gingersnaps
    1/4 c  Ground pecans
      1 tb Grand Mariner
      1 ts Cinnamon
 
  Mix flour, cinnamon, salt, butter and shortening until a crumbly
  mixture forms. Add in the juice slowly, until a smooth dough forms.
  Melt butter, and mix the rest of the ingredients into it.
  
  Putting it all together: Core 3/4 of an apple (preferably a Granny
  Smith) making sure that there is plenty of room for the filling. Roll
  out the dough, the thinner the better. Wrap dough around the apple.
  Squeeze off the excess and create leaves for the top of the apple
  with the extra. Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 20 minutes
  until dough becomes a light to golden brown. It will not get too dark
  so definitely keep checking on it.
  
  The dough recipe should yield enough for two apples. To make a stem
  for the apple use a small piece of cinnamon stick

      1 ds Pepper, black

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 tb Teriyaki sauce
      2 tb Broth
 
  Preparation: ============
  
   Cook the asparagus by boiling, steaming, stir-frying or microwaving
  until it's tender.  (The whole spear with the tough end cut off
  should be kept whole.) Steaming takes 2 to 3 minutes. Stir-frying 1
  to 2 and so on. Use whatever method you prefer.
  
   Prepare the marinade for the beef by mixing all of the ingredients
  well and setting them aside.
  
   Prepare some braising sauce for the cooking and set aside.
  
   Slice your beef loin into very thin slices.  Put them in a small
  baking dish or shallow bowl and cover with marinade ingredients. Stir
  well to mix and set in a refrigerator for ten minutes or more.
  
  Cooking: ========
  
   Take one of the marinated slices of beef and "fill" it with some
  Inoki mushroom, some Shitake mushroom, a little green onion, and
  steamed asparagus and roll the beef. Use a toothpick to secure the
  meat.
  
   Brown in a little peanut oil (two rolls per person as a serving).
  
   Add the braising sauce (Teriyaki and broth) and cover, cooking over
  medium heat for three to four minutes until done.
  
   Serve rolls with cooked rice, and garnish with drippings from the
  pan and some Inoki mushrooms.

 Categories: Soups, Appetizers, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Chestnuts, roasted & peeled
      1 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Onion, finely chopped
    1/4 c  Celery, chopped
  2 1/4 c  Water
    3/4 c  Apple juice
      1 ts Tamari
      1    Vegetable bouillon cube

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
      1 ds Nutmeg
 
  * To roast chestnuts: Choose fresh, firm, unwrinkled chestnuts with no
  signs of mold. On the flat side of each chestnut make 2 cuts with a
  small, sharp knife, from one end to the other in the shape of an X.
  Place the chestnuts, cut side up, on a low baking sheet with a thin
  layer of water on the bottom. Bake the chestnuts for 20-25 minutes at
  350F until browned and the cuts peel back naturally from the heat.
  Test one chestnut to be sure its "meat" is tender. When tender,
  remove from oven, cool only slightly, peel and enjoy or use in
  recipes. Some people like to boil the cut chestnuts for easier
  peeling. This is okay, though some nutrients and flavour will be lost.
  
  Prepare chestnuts. Peel off the outer shell and the fuzzy skin before
  using the inner chestnut meat.
  
  Heat the oil until hot and saute the onion until semi-tender. Add the
  celery and saute until both are very tender. Blend the water and apple
  juice with the chestnuts and all the remaining ingredients*. Simmer
  everything on low to medium heat (do NOT boil!) for about 15-20
  minutes or until hot throughout and the flavours mingle. Enjoy this
  rich and tantalizing soup with extra chopped or ground nuts as a
  garnish.
  
  Keeps 4-6 days refrigerated.
  
  *Two vegetable bouillon cubes may be used instead of the tamari or
  miso. Also, 1/2 cup applesauce and 2 1/2 cups water can be used
  instead of the juice and 2 1/4 cups water. *Anne's note: I would
  assume by reading this, she means blend these ingredients in a
  blender and return to the pot.

      1    5-pound pumpkin
      2    To 3 cups brown rice,
           Cooked
      2 c  Crumbled dry whole wheat
           Bread (or part corn bread
           Etc ) I used bread
           Crumbs and corn meal.
      1    Onion, chopped
    1/2    To 1 cup chopped celery and
           Leaves
      2    Apples (tart and unpeeled),
           Chopped
      1 c  Roasted chestnuts or a
           Andful of cashew nuts, cut
           In half.
        x  Herbs: Sage, savory,
           Marjoram, oregano, and
           Paprika to taste. I used
           About a teaspoon
           Each
      1    To 2 cups vegetable stock
    1/4    To 1/2 cup butter, melted,
           Or safflower oil.
           [ed ...Necessary?]
           Soy sauce or salt to taste.
 
  Cut off top of pumpkin to make a lid. Remove the seeds and scrape out
  any stringy pulp. Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl and
  mix well with hands. Add stock and butter, and mix well, adding soy
  sauce and salt if desired. Stuffing should be moist but not wet. Pack
  loosely into pumpkin, replace lid, and bake on oiled cookie sheet for
  1 1/2 hours or more at 325 F. It is done when a fork pushes easily
  through the pumpkin. Transfer to a caserloe dish and serve at the
  table, scooping out some of the tender pumpkin flesh with each
  serving of stuffing. If the pumpkin is organically grown, you may eat
  the skin too. (If you have too much stuffing for your pumpkin, place
  extra in an oiled casserole, cover, and bake for 1 hour.)

 Categories: Ice cream, Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------MOUSSE--------------------------------
      5 oz Bittersweet chocolate
  1 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      4 tb Butter
      5 tb Dry marsala
      2    Egg yolks
      4    Egg whites, room temp
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Whipping cream,
           -whipped and chilled
    1/2 c  Chopped pistachios

MMMMM--------------------MOCHA MARSALA SAUCE-------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Instant espresso granules
    1/2 c  Boiling water
    1/3 c  Dry marsala
      4 oz Bittersweet chocolate
      5 ts Sugar
      2 tb Butter
 
    Mousse and sauce can be done a day in advance. To prepare mousse,
  melt bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate and set aside to cool to
  room temperature. Combine butter and marsala in a small bowl and set
  over boiling water. Heat until marsala is bubbling and butter melted.
  Remove bowl from pan and let cool a few moments, then whisk in yolks.
  Place again over boiling water and stir until yolks begin to thicken.
  Cool. Add cream of tartar to whites and beat to soft peaks and
  gradually beat in sugar until stiff and glossy. Gently fold together
  whites, cooled chocolate, egg mixture, cream and nuts, taking care to
  keep mixture light. Turn into a freezer container and freeze at least
  4 hours. Let stand a couple of hours in refrigerator to soften before
  serving.
  
   To make the sauce, combine the coffee with boiling water and stir
  until dissolved. Turn into a small bowl, adding the marsala,
  chocolate and sugar. Set over a pan of hot water and stir until
  chocolate is melted. Stir in butter until smooth. Reheat before
  serving.
  
    To serve, use a small ice cream scoop to spoon out about 4 balls of
  mousse into each of 8 wine glasses. Drizzle with hot sauce and serve.

      1 tb Butter
      8 oz Milk chocolate chips

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Pecan halves or pieces
 
  Prepare the crust:
  
  1. Coat the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with 1
  tablespoon butter.
  
  2. Combine cookie crumbs, nuts and melted butter in a medium bowl.
  Toss until butter is absorbed. Press crumb mixture on the bottom and
  sides of pan. Refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes.
  
  Prepare the filling:
  
  3. In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, brown sugar, granulated
  sugar, flour and salt with an electric mixer at medium speed until
  free of lumps. Mix in vanilla. Beat in eggs and yolk, one at a time,
  and continue beating until batter is smooth. Stir in cream and
  candies. Pour filling into crust.
  
  4. Bake on the middle shelf in a preheated 325-degree oven until
  cheesecake is fairly firm to touch (center will jiggle slightly when
  pan is tapped), about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, then
  refrigerate at least 6 hours.
  
  5. Remove cheesecake from pan and decorate as desired. Diana Moles of
  Eli's research and development staff suggests drizzling the cake with
  milk chocolate ganache, or drizzling with Smucker's Magic Shell
  chocolate topping or a prepared caramel sauce (at room temperature)
  and then sprinkling pecan halves or pieces on top. Refrigerate until
  time to serve.
  
  Milk Chocolate Ganache:
  
  Combine cream, sugar and butter in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over
  medium heat (do not let boil). Add chocolate chips. Whisk until
  melted and thoroughly blended. Let cool. Drizzle ganache over cake
  with a pastry bag or a spoon.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    10" shortcrust pastry case*
      2    Thin-skinned oranges
           Honey and sugar
           Stick cinnamon
           Ground cinnamon
           Allspice
    1/4 pt Double cream
    1/4 lb Fromage blanc (or see note)
      2 tb Ground almonds
 
  *Note: Shortcrust pastry case should be thoroughly blind-baked.
  Low-fat soft cheese may be substituted for fromage blanc.
  
  Measure 2 tablespoons sugar into a bowl and stir in 4 tablespoons
  boiling water. Add a cinnamon stick and 1/4 pint cold water. Scrub
  the oranges, flute the peel lightly with a citrus zester and slice
  the fruit thinly, discarding the ends. Remove pips (seeds), put the
  orange slices into the sweetened water and leave to soak overnight.
  Next day, turn the oranges and their liquid into a saucepan. Cover
  and cook very gently for about 30 minutes. Carefully turn the slices
  once they cook. Lift the cooked orange slices from the pan one at a
  time, shaking to let the syrup drip back into the pan, and put them
  on a rack to drain and become cold. Remove the cinnamon stick, then
  boil the syrup until reduced to a few sticky spoonfuls. Cool slightly
  then stir in the 1 tablespoon honey. Assemble the tart just before
  serving. First sprinkle the ground almonds over the base of the cold
  pastry shell. Sweeten and flavour the soft cheese by stirring into it
  1 teaspoon or so of honey and a little each of ground cinnamon and
  allspice. Whip the cream, fold in the sweetened and flavoured cheese,
  then spoon this mixture into the pastry shell. Arrange the orange
  slices on top, overlapping them slightly in decorative circles, and
  glaze with the gently re-warmed syrup.

  Recipe by: The Cuisines of Mexico by Diana Kennedy ISBN 0-06-012344-3
  Again, there are so many variations of corn-chile-cream dishes that
  is is hard to know just which recipe to choose. For a change, the
  chiles could be left whole, stuffed with corn and cheese, and cooked
  in cream. But this combination is delicious any way.
  
  This is a very rich dish, and is very good served as a separate
  course with hot tortillas. It is best eaten right after it's cooked,
  as the cheese gets tough when reheated.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Melt the butter and cook the onion and garlic, without browning,
  until they are soft.
  
  Cut the chiles into rajas (strips), add them to the pan, and cook
  them, covered, 8 minutes.
  
  Add the corn, heese, and salt to the chile mixture. Cover tightly
  with foil or a lid and let it bake for 20 minutes for frozen corn. If
  you use fresh corn, cook for 40 minutes, adding the cheese after the
  first
       20    minutes of cooking time.
  
  Serve the vegetables hot, with the sour cream.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Unbleached flour, plus more
           For feeding
    1/2 c  Whole grain rye flour
      1 c  Bottled still water, plus
           More for feeding
 
  In a large glass bowl stir flours and water together with a spoon.
  Cover with a kitchen towel. Set aside to ferment at room temp for 2
  to 3 days. It will begin to smell sour, but not in an unpleasant way.
  Stir in 2/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup water, cover and continue to
  ferment at room temp. Refresh starter in this way every day for 3
  days. It will become sharper and more pungent as it sits. When it is
  sharp enough for you, begin using it to bake with. After using the
  amount of starter you need, the remaining starter should be
  refrigerated. Let it come to room temp each time you use it.

  Sift the flour with a pinch of salt into a mixing bowl, or place in a
  food processor and mix once or twice. Rub in the margerine and
  shortening until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, or work in
  the food processor, being careful not to over-mix. Mix the liquid
  gradually, adding enough to bring the pastry together into a ball.
  (In a food processor, add the liquid through the funnel while the
  motor is running.) Wrap the pastry well, and chill for 20 to 30
  minutes.
  
  Brown the ground meat well, and drain away as much of the fat as
  possible.
  
  until the onion is soft. Add to the meat. Then add the cocoa, flour,
  spices, oregano, and seasonings. Stir well and cook briefly before
  adding the chilies and the tomatoes. Cook slowly for 10-15 minutes.
  
  Add the nuts and the olives, and allow to cool. (Oh, you were
  supposed to add the parsley with the tomatoes, above.)
  
  Roll out the pastry on a floured surface. (We didn't do this. We ran
  the dough through the pasta machine - much easier! We found the #3
  setting on our Atlas pasta maker to be the right thickness.)
  
  Cut the dough into 4 inch rounds. (I used a leftover container from
  ricotta cheese to get the right size.)
  
  Place about 1-1/2 tablespoons of filling on the dough circle. Fold
  over, and press to seal. If the dough is a little dry, moisten the
  edges with a little warm water (with your finger) before pressing the
  edges together. Crimp the edges with a fork. With a toothpick, prick
  several holes on the top of the empanada to allow the steam to escape.
  
  Mix the glaze ingredients together. Place empanadas on a baking
  sheet, and brush with the egg glaze.
  
  Bake at 425 for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
  
  If you like, you can freeze these. To bake frozen empanadas, place the
  frozen pastries on a cooking sheet and brush with the egg glaze. Bake
  for 30-35 minutes at 425 degrees.
  
  Makes 15 empanadas.

      Title: EMPANADAS (BRAZILIAN MEAT PIES)
 Categories: Appetizers, Poultry
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      4 c  Flour
      1 tb Butter
      1 c  Shortening
      2    Whole eggs
      1    Egg yolk
      2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Cold water
           For the filling:
      1 tb Oil
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped (about
           -1/4 cup)
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      3    Chicken legs
      1    Bay leaf
      2 tb Tomato paste
           Salt & pepper
           Water, as needed
      3 tb Flour
    1/4 c  Cooked peas
      8    Pitted green olives, chopped
           Cayenne pepper
      1    Egg beaten with a pinch of
           -salt for glaze
 
  Servings: Makes 50 1/2-inch empanadas
  
  Notes: Empanadas are Brazil's national appetizer, tiny pies filled
  with chicken olives, and peas. Belita's are famous all over Brazil.
  Empanadas are traditionally made in special molds that are almost as
  deep as they are wide. If they are unavailable, any small tartlet
  molds will do. "The secret to making good dough," says Belita, "is to
  massage it, not knead it." It may look as if she's making mud pies,
  but the results are truly superb.
  
  For the dough:
  
  To prepare the dough: Place the flour in a large mixing bowl and make
  a well in the center. Place the butter, shortening, eggs, salt, and 1
  cup water in the well. Using one hand to mix, squeeze these
  ingredients through your fingers to make a paste. Gradually work in
  the flour, squeezing the dough between your fingers to mix it. Add
  water as necessary; the dough should be quite soft. Let the dough
  rest for 30 minutes while you prepare the filling.
  
  Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Saute the onion and garlic over
  medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add the
  chicken, bay leaf, tomato paste, salt, and pepper, plus water just to
  cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, or
  until the chicken is cooked. Skim off the fat that rises to the
  surface. Remove the chicken, then strain and reserve the broth.
  
  When the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and
  remove the meat from the bone. Finely shred the meat with your
  fingers or in a food processor. Stir in the flour, peas, and olives.
  Stir in 3 to 4 Tbsp broth; the filling should be moist but not runny.
  Add enough cayenne to give the chicken a little bite.
  
  Pinch off cherry-sized pieces of dough and use them to line the
  tartlet molds. Belita pushes the dough in with her thumb. The dough
  should just reach over the top of the mold. Place a spoonful of
  filling in each crust.
  
  Roll out the remaining dough and cut out tops for the empanadas. Try
  to capture an air bubble when you place the top over the filling;
  according to Belita, this is what makes the pies light. Seal the
  tartlets by pinching together the top and bottom crust. Note: The
  empanadas can be prepared ahead to this stage and frozen.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350-F. Brush the tops with egg glaze. Bake for 30
  minutes or until golden brown. Unmold and serve.

      Title: EMPANADAS - S. AMERICAN
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      2 c  Flour, all purpose
    2/3 c  Shortening or lard
    1/2 ts Salt
      6 tb Water

MMMMM-----------------------DESSERT FRUIT----------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Fruit
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Nutmeg

MMMMM----------------------CARNE ( ANY MEAT---------------------------
      1    Onion
      1 tb Olive oil
      4 oz Water
           Sal and Pepper to taste
      1    Pepper, green
      8 oz Tomato paste
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 lb Beef, sliced thinly
 
  DOUGH:
       In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in the
  shortening or lard till pieces are the size of small peas. Add a
  small amount of water to slightly moisten. Form dough into a ball.
  Roll out the dough to about 1/8 thick and cut into 4" circles. Flour
  lightly both side of circles and then stack up for later use.
  
  DESSERT FILLING:  Just about any kind of fruit or melon may be used.
  Combine ingredients and heat to thoroughly mix, coarse chop, so that
  filling is chunky but bite-sized. Pumpkins is very good!!
  
  CARNE:  Just about any kind of meat may be used, depending on
  availability. The sauce seems to be the only fairly consistent thing.
  Saute the onion and green pepper in olive oil.  Add remaining
  ingredients and cook for 20 minutes.  ( In S.A. this is continually
  cooked and prepared on the back burner, often being used and added to
  for several months at a time. It developes a flavor all its own...)
  Add meat and coat thoroughly with the sauce.
  
  COOKING:  Add a large spoonfull of one of the above mixtures to the
  center of a dough circle.  Place another circle on top. Fasten the
  two circles together by reeding the edges with a fork.  These may
  then be baked, at around 350 degrees F until brown, deep fat fried,
  fried, cooked or heated on a barbecue. They may also be wrapped in
  banana husks, well moistened corn husks, etc.  The object is to heat
  thoroughly, cooking the meat and browning the outsides so they are
  dry enough to hold together.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 ts Chilled margarine
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
      3 tb Ice water
      2 oz Cooked ground pork, crumbled
           -(OR finely chopped
           Cooked ham)
      2 oz Monterey Jack or Cheddar
           -cheese, shredded
      1 ts Prepared spicy brown mustard
      1 ds Crushed red pepper
      1    Egg separated
      1 tb Skim milk
 
  Paprika Garnish: red bell pepper strips and cilantro leaves
  
  In small bowl, with pastry blender or 2 knives, cut margarine into
  flour until mixture resembles corn meal; sprinkle with ice water and,
  using fork, mix to form soft dough. Roll dough between 2 sheets of
  wax paper to form rectangle about 1/4 inch thick; remove paper and
  use 2-inch diameter plain or fluted cookie cutter to cut dough into
  rounds. Roll scraps of dough and continue cutting until all dough has
  been used (should yield 24 rounds). Combine pork (or ham), cheese,
  mustard, and red pepper in small bowl and set aside. Preheat oven to
  375.
  
  Beat egg white lightly and brush an equal amount onto each pastry
  round. Spoon an equal amount of the meat mixture (about 1/2 rounded
  teaspoon) onto center of each round; fold pastry over,
  turnover-fashion, to enclose filling.  Press edges of dough together
  to seal. Transfer turnovers to nonstick cookie sheet. Add milk to egg
  yolk and beat lightly; brush an equal amount of mixture over each
  turnover and sprinkle each with a dash of paprika.  Bake until
  turnovers are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to warmed
  serving tray; garnish with red pepper strips and cilantro. Chili
  sauce or salsa can be served as a dipping sauce.
  
  Makes 8 servings of 3 turnovers each.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Flour
      2 tb Of sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      5 tb Of Crisco
      3 ea Eggs (slightly beaten)
           Vino Seco
           About 6-8 Tablespoons of
           -cold water
 
  Sift flour, sugar and salt together in a large bowl. Using a pastry
  hook on your mixer or using a fork, cut in the Crisco into the flour
  mixture until it is nice and crumbly. Make a deep will in center of
  the flour mixture. Add beaten eggs and about 3-4 Tablespoons of Vino
  Seco into center of bowl. Slowly mix together adding just enough
  water ( a teaspoon at time) until the mixture comes together and
  makes a soft dough. It shouldn't be stiff! Using a heavy rolling pin
  or a pasta machine roll out the dough very thin. The pasta machine is
  much faster. I usually run the dough from setting number 1 through
  setting number 6. You're going to be rolling out enough dough to make
  a circle about of a CD disk (if this makes sense) for each empanada.
  In the center of this circle place your filling. This can be guava
  paste (my favorite!), picadillo, or chicken. Once the filling is
  placed in the middle of the dough, fold over one side over the other
  forming a half-moon turnover. Using a pastry wheel or sharp knife,
  trim the edge making sure they are sealed. Using a fork, go around
  the edges pressing down with the tines making a nice decorative edge.
  Fry in hot Crisco until golden. Empandas

 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1    Onion
        x  Several cloves of garlic
      1    16 oz. can crushed tomatoes
      1 cn Chilis (I got the smallest
        cn Green ones)
        x  Oregano and basil to taste

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 c  Black beans
      1 c  Whole wheat couscous,
           Reconstituted
    1/2 pk White Wave lowfat firm tofu,
           Crushed (+ sauce)
        x  Corn tortillas
 
  Water saute the onion and garlic until brown, deglaze and continue
  until they reach the condition you favor. Add tomatoes and chilis.
  Add spices and salt and pepper to taste and simmer while you mess
  with the rest of the ingredients  (Note: I would have added corn
  here, had I had it).
  
  Reconstitute couscous with hot water.  Stir together couscous, beans
  and crushed tofu.  Add sauce to create a desirable consistency. (Be
  sure to save enough sauce for the casserole).
  
  Squirt a 9x13 pan with cooking spray and then put a bit of sauce in
  the bottom and spread it around.  Heat a skillet to medium and use it
  to soften the corn tortillas (put them on the skillet and flip them
  when they get a bit hot; they should wind up soft). Roll about 2 to 3
  tablespoons of the filling in each tortilla (while heating the one to
  follow) and squeeze them tightly side by side in the pan. Cover the
  rolls with remaining sauce when you're done.
  
  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes and then let stand for ten
  minutes.
  
  Note: since I always cook for me and one fat-loving ovo-lacto
  vegetarian (we just got engaged!), I made extra of everything (so
  don't take my proportions as absolute) and filled two 8x8 pans,
  rather than one 9x13. I then added extra stuff to his pan of
  enchiladas, leaving my pan pristine. This is the way I always make
  lasagna too; one pan with fatty stuff added to the vlf recipe for him
  and the vlf version for me. Anyway, I loved my enchiladas, and he
  gave his an 8 out of 10.

      4 tb Oil
     10    Garlic clove; minced
           Salt to taste
      6 tb Flour

MMMMM------------------------SALSA VERDE-----------------------------
      4 lb Tomatillos, peeled
    1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Garlic; chopped
 
  In large pot, boil chicken in water to cover until tender; reserve 2
  cups broth.  Debone and dice chicken. Add chicken, tomatoes, onion,
  salt and garlic to reserved broth; boil 10 minutes or until reduced
  enough for enchilada filling.  Strain. Heat a bit of oil in a small
  skillet; press each tortillas into the hot oil a few seconds to
  soften them and make them more pliable to roll. Stuff with chicken
  filling. Roll filled tortillas and place in baking dish. Cover
  one-third of the enchiladas (longways) with salsa verde, the center
  third with the sour cream, and the final third with salsa colorado.
  The result should resemble the Mexican flag. Bake at 375 degrees
  until thoroughly heated, about 25 minutes.
  
  Salsa colorado:  Wash chiles, stem and seed. Cook in boiling water to
  cover well 10 mins. or until soft. Remove and drain. Reserve liquid.
  Place chiles in blender with reserved water, and whirl until you
  achieve a pasty consistency. Heat oil in large skillet. Add garlic
  and flour and cook, stirring until flour browns. Add chile paste
  slowly to mix well with flour to a smooth paste. When all the chile
  paste is added, bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook until it
  thickens, 3-4 minutes. Thin with water to a thick, saucy consistency.
  
  Salsa verde:  Boil tomatillos in small amount of water until tender;
  blend in food processor. In skillet, saute onions in oil. Add pureed
  tomatillos, salt and garlic.

      Title: ENCHILADAS SABROSAS
 Categories: Meats, Latin
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Ground meat (mixed
           -ground beef and
           -ground pork)
      1 md Onion
    1/2    Green pepper
      5    Garlic cloves
      1    Cilantro bunch
    1/2 ts Red pepper
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cumin (or more)
    1/2 c  Wine or sherry
    3/4 c  Black olives
  1 1/2 c  Enchilada sauce
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
           -(1 small can)
     12    Corn tortillas
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese
    1/2 c  Sour cream (optional)
           Oil
 
  Chop onion and garlic; place them in a frying pan with the ground
  meats. Saute them without adding fat.  When meat is brown, add the
  chopped green pepper and most of the cilantro leaves and cook for
  another minute or two (until green pepper is cooked bright green).
  Drain well, then add (about) several tablespoons of the enchilada
  sauce and cook for a few minutes longer. Set aside.
  
  Make the sauce:  into a saucepan, pour the remaining enchilada sauce
  (from the can). Add the can of tomato sauce. Add the wine or sherry,
  cumin, salt, red pepper, and cook for 10-30 minutes (depending on how
  compulsive you are). The flavor should be smooth (not gritty) and
  spicy.
  
  Collect together everything that you will need for assembling the
  enchiladas. Grate the cheese onto wax paper. Have the olives handy
  (you'll be cutting them in half). Lightly oil the baking dish.
  
  The frying pan from which you drained the meat mixture still has some
  of its grease left in it. Take 4 tortillas from their package,
  separate them from each other, then one-by-one, slide them over the
  frying pan surface on each side, to moisten them slightly with the
  grease. That done, stack them in the frying pan and heat them until
  they are soft and pliable.
  
  The final  assembly requires a bit of manual dexterity and speed:
  Take the tortillas, and place them (bumpy side out) in the oven dish,
  curved into a "U" shape, each right next to its neighbor. (At this
  point, start heating your  next 4 tortillas in the frying pan. I
  usually wind up preparing 10 tortillas in all.)
  
  Place a small handful of cheese into the U of each tortilla, followed
  by an appropriate amount of meat mixture, and finally several olive
  halves. Then curl one end of the tortilla around to tuck into the
  opposite end, and carefully rotate it to conceal the seam. Each
  tortilla should be filled firmly (not too loosely) but not
  overflowing the ends.
  
  Once all the filling is used up and the enchiladas are now filled
  tortillas, pour the sauce over the top, helping it run into all the
  crevices. Sprinkle lightly with remaining cilantro leaves. 10 Cover
  with aluminum foil and bake for 20-30 minutes, just until the
  tortillas are soft and the sauce is slightly bubbly. Let sit for 5
  minutes, then serve, topped with a dollop of sour cream. If you fail
  to drain the meat well enough, the enchiladas will be greasy. If
  over-baked, it tastes all right, but the tortillas lose their
  texture. In general, however, the recipe is quite forgiving in its
  proportions. Feel free to adjust the seasoning to your own tolerance
  for hot spice. I like to assemble this recipe at least 3 hours before
  baking to give the flavors a chance to blend. Left refrigerated for a
  day, the seasoning is even less aggressive. Served with a salad (and
  some Mexican beer), it's a complete meal.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Enchiladas with meat, black olives and cheese -- For many years,
  I've been involved in Latin American "solidarity work" here in the
  San Francisco area, and as a result, I have learned some of its
  culinary pleasures. This recipe originated from the back of a can of
  enchilada sauce in Mexico, but was refined by a special Chilean
  refugee friend who won a scholarship to the California Culinary
  Academy (in San Francisco) and now cooks ever-so-lusciously.  Yield:
  Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 30 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK, but time the baking
  carefully.

   Drain and rinse the tofu. Put the tofu in a plastic bag or container,
  close it tightly, and freeze until the tofu is frozen hard. Remove
  the bag or container from the freezer and put it in a bowl of hot
  water, or let the tofu thaw at room temperature. Gently squeeze the
  water from the tofu with your hands, and then squeeze it between tow
  kitchen towels. Cut the tofu into 1/4 inch cubes.

  dish.
  
   Heat a dry frying pan or griddle over medium heat.
   Brush each tortilla lightly on both sides with oil.
   Add the tortillas, one at a time, to the pan or griddle and beat for
  about 15 seconds on each side so they are warm and flexible. Put 1/2
  cup of the tofu-vegetable mixture in the center of each tortilla.
   Roll up tightly and place in the baking dish seam side down. Pour the
  remaining tomato sauce over the enchiladas. Cover with aluminum foil,
  and bake until bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes.

      3 oz Queso Fresco or
           "Enchilada Cheese",
           Crumbled
 
  Start with the filling: Place the chicken in a saucepan. Add water to
  cover. Add the garlic, carrot, bay leaf, parsley and half the onion.
  Bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Cover. Simmer until the chicken is
  tender (about 30 minutes). Let cool in the broth. Remove the meat
  from the skin and bones. Shred the chicken meat. Cover to prevent it
  from drying out. Set aside. Strain the broth. Set aside. Combine the
  sour cream with the heavy cream. Let stand at room temperature for 30
  minutes to thicken. Shred the cheese. Set aside. Slice the remaining
  onion. Rinse with cold water. Set aside 2 slices of onion per
  serving. Add the left over onion to the broth. Combine the shredded
  chicken with half of the shredded cheese. Set the remaining cheese
  aside. Add 1/4 of the sour cream to the chicken and cheese mixture.
  Blend carefully. Heat about 1" of oil in a large skillet (one big
  enough to hold an unrolled tortilla flat) to 300 degrees. Pass the
  tortillas, one at a time, through the oil (to soften and seal them).
  Press between paper towels to remove excess oil. Divide the filling
  equally between the tortillas. Roll each up and place, seam side
  down, in a buttered casserole dish. Keep covered while preparing the
  sauce. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the husks from the
  tomatillos. Wash off any sticky residue. Combine the tomatillos,
  chiles and minced garlic. Puree (a food processor will do this best).
  Place the mixture in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Stir in the sugar,
  salt, pepper and the measured amount of the chicken broth. Keep hot.
  Cover the tortillas in the baking dish. Bake until heated through
  (about 10 minutes). Cover with the sauce. Top with the reserved
  shredded cheese. Bake, uncovered, until the cheese melts (5-8
  minutes). Garnish with the reserved onion slices and the crumbled
  cheese. Serve at once with the remaining (room temperature) sour
  cream mixture.

      Title: ENCHILADAS~ CIRCA 1908
 Categories: Mexican
      Yield: 12 Enchiladas
 
      4 c  Pitted green or black
           -olives, roughly chopped
      3 c  Raisins
     12 lg Flour tortillas
           Chilisalya
      1 lb Gouda cheese, shredded
 
  The original recipe from Mrs. Robert Y. McBride, which appreared in
  "The Los Angeles Times Cookbook Number Three" (1908), included
  instructions for making tortillas - flour, rather than corn - because
  they weren't yet available in stores.
  
  The olive-and-raisin filling and the use of Gouda, instead of Mexican
  cheese, were common at the time.
  
  "Chilisalya" was clearly a misreading of a handwritten recipe for
  chili salsa. Notice the use of tarragon vinegar, a seemingly modern,
  though not particularly Mexican, idea.
  
  Mix olives and raisins in bowl. In bowl, dip 1 tortilla in Chilisalya
  and place on work surface. Put 1/12 of olive-raisin mixture on
  tortilla, add 1 tablespoon Chilisalya and some cheese. Roll tortilla
  up and place in baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
  
  Pour remaining Chilisalya on tortillas in baking dish and sprinkle
  enchiladas with remaining cheese. Bake at
      325    degrees 10-15 minutes.
  
  Each enchilada contains about: 416 calories; 798 milligrams sodium; 48
  milligrams cholesterol; 19 grams fat; 52 grams carbohydrates; 13 grams
  protein; 1.31 grams fiber.
  
  Makes 12 enchiladas, or 6-12 servings.

    1/2 sm Green cabbage, coarse chop
      2 ea Red bell peppers; chopped
      2 ea Green bell peppers; chopped

    1/2 ea Peeled cucumber; chopped
      5 tb Pickling salt
      1 c  Packed light brown sugar
  2 3/4 c  Cider or white vinegar
 
  This is an excellent relish for using up excess garden produce left
  at the end of the summer. It's good with meat and poultry and with a
  sharply flavored cheese, such as a mature cheddar. Makes nine 1/2
  pint jars.
  
  Layer tomatoes, cabbage, bell peppers, celery, onions and cucumber
  with the salt in a large non-aluminum bowl. Let stand overnight to
  draw out the moisture.
  
  Drain the vegetables in a sieve, pressing them to remove as much
  liquid as possible. rinse in the sieve under cold running water,
  drain again, and pat dry on paper towels. Put the vegetables into a
  large, non-aluminum saucepan. Add the sugar and vinegar; stir to mix.
  Simmer the mixture for 1 hour or until the vegetables are tender and
  the sauce has thickened.
  
  Meanwhile, wash 9 half pint jars. Keep hot until needed. Prepare lids
  as manufacturer directs.
  
  Spoon the relish into one hot jar at a time, leaving 1/2 inch head
  space. Wipe jar rim and threads with a clean, damp cloth. Attach lid.
  fill and close remaining jars.
  
  Process in a boiling water bath canner for 10 minutes.

      Title: END-OF-MONTH VEGETABLE SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2    Chinese cabbage
    1/2    Carrot
    1/2    Red bell pepper
      1    Yellow onion
      4 sm Potatoes
    1/8 lb Bacon pieces
           -(for seasoning)
      4    Prosciutto end bits
           -(for seasoning, optional)
      5    Stalks celery
      1    Bouquet garni (e.g.,
           -about 1 t each parsley
           -and thyme, 1 or 2 bay
           -leaves)
      2    Chicken or beef bouillon
           -cubes
      2    Garlic cloves
           Pepper (to taste)
      1 c  White wine (optional)
 
  Make the bouquet garni by tying the herbs up in a cheesecloth or
  coffee filter.  Put a quart of water to boil with about 1/2 t salt (I
  don't like to use too much salt if I use bouillon), the bouquet garni
  and the bouillon.
  
  Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and add these to the soup together
  with the bacon and/or prosciutto ends. Bring this to a boil. Simmer 5
  minutes. If scum forms on the surface, skim it off.
  
  Dice the potatoes and add to the boiling pot.  Cut up everything else
  and add it. Add the wine. Adjust the liquid so that it covers the
  vegetables. After it boils again, adjust the seasoning and simmer for
  about an hour, or until it is done (this is quite subjective).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Soup with a mixture of vegetables -- I had an eclectic mixture of
  vegetables going bad in the refrigerator, so I collected them and
  came up with this soup. It was very good, so I would like to share it
  with you all. Caveat:  I rarely measure anything, so be careful of
  quantities.
  
  *  This will serve 6 people at once, or 2 people for three days. It
  ages well in the refrigerator.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour simmering.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      6 lg Endives
      4 oz Soft bread, crust removed,
           -shredded
    3/4 c  Milk
      5 oz Ham, cut in little squares
      2    Hard-boiled eggs
    2/3 c  Light cream
      3 tb Grated gruyere cheese
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
           Salt, pepper to taste

  each endive. Remove also the not-so-nice-looking outer leaves, if
  any. Wash the endives under running water.
  
  2. Boil salted water in a pot large enough to take the six endives.
  Boil the endives for 10 minutes.
  
  3. Remove from water, let cool a bit and cut them lenghtwise in two.
  BUT DO NOT CUT COMPLETELY. The two halves must stay attached to each
  other. Drain on paper towels.
  
  4. Put the soft bread in the milk. Mash the hard-boiled eggs with a
  fork. Mix together the ham, the eggs and the bread/milk mixture. Add
  salt, pepper and the nutmeg. Mix well.
  
  5. Butter a gratin dish. Fill each endive with the mixture and put,
  one by one, in the gratin dish.
  
  6. Pour the cream over the endives, and the grated cheese. Add some
  little cubes of butter over the dish. Put in a warm 400 F oven for 15
  minutes.

  will begin to look like crumbs or small pebbles. It will have the
  texture of oatmeal. Sprinkle the water over the dough, distributing
  it evenly throughout.  The dough will be come sticky and cling
  together.  Gather it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap. Chill
  for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
   When the pastry has chilled, roll it out on a pastry board to a
  thickness of 1/8-inch.  The easiest way is to roll the dough between
  2 sheets of waxed paper.
   Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin and transfer it to a 9-inch
  pie tin.  Gently press it into the tin without stretching it. Use the
  excess pastry to make flutes or cut away the excess with a sharp
  knife or scissors.  Prick the bottom of the pastry shell thoroughly
  to prevent trapped air from bubbling the dough. Butter a sheet of
  aluminum foil and place the foil down into the shell. Weight it down
  with weights or beans to keep the crust from lifting up.  Bake the
  crust for 7 to 10 minutes then remove the weight and the foil. Return
  the crust to the oven and continue baking for another 8 to 10 minutes
  or until the crust is lightly browned. If you have difficulty rolling
  out the dough, do not reroll it; just patch the tears or holes.
  Rerolling will make the pastry tough. FILLING: Preheat the oven to
  350 degrees F.  Press the cottage cheese through a sieve. In a small
  saucepan, gently heat the cream and the sherry until steamy, do not
  allow it to scorch.  In a mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, egg
  yolks, sugar, rosewater, and the spices until frothy -- about 5
  minutes. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cottage cheese until it is
  smooth then add the egg mixture and blend well.  Add the hot cream
  and sherry slowly to the cheese mixture and beat until well blended.
  Stir in the currants and pour the mixture into the prepared crust.
  Bake for about 30 minutes, then allow to cool.  Chill and sprinkle
  with cinnamon.

      Title: ENGLISH CRUMPETS (BAKESTONE RECIPES)
 Categories: Bakery, Breads, Breakfast, Snacks
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 oz All-purpose flour
      4 oz Bread flour
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 oz Fresh yeast
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 pt Warm water
      1 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
    1/4 pt Warm water
 
  Sift the flours and salt into a warm bowl.  Cream the yeast with the
  sugar. Add the warmed water, then the oil. Stir into the flour to
  make a batter, and beat vigorously until smooth and elastic. Cover
  the bowl, put in a warm place and leave it until the mixture rises
  and the surface is full of bubbles (about 1 1/2 hours). Break it down
  by beating with a wooden spoon. Cover and leave in a warm place to
  prove for another 30 minutes. To cook the crumpets, heat and grease
  the bakestone lightly. Grease 5 or 6 crumpet rings (3-3 1/2 inches)
  (or scone cutters) and put them on the bakestone to heat. Cook as
  many crumpets as possible at a time, as the batter will not stay
  bubbly for long. Put 1/2 inch deep of batter into each ring. Cook
  gently for 7 - 10 minutes, or until the surface sets and is full of
  tiny bubbles. Using an oven glove for protection, lift off the ring,
  and if the base of the crumpet is pale gold, flip it over and cook
  for another 3 minutes until the other side is just colored. If the
  crumpet batter is set but sticks slightly in the ring, push it out
  gently with the back of a wooden spoon.  Wipe, grease and heat the
  rings for each batch of crumpets. If serving immediately, wrap the
  crumpets in a cloth and keep warm between batches. Butter generously
  and serve at once. If reheating, toast the crumpets under the grill,
  cooking the smooth surface first and then the top so that the butter
  will melt into the holes.

      Title: ENGLISH CRUMPETS - :)
 Categories: Ron's, Muffins, British, Breads
      Yield: 15 Approx
 
    200 g  Strong white flour
  2 1/2 ml Salt
  2 1/2 ml Sugar
    100 ml Milk
     10 ml Dried yeast
      1 pn Bicarb of Soda
           Fat for frying
 
  English crumpets are delicious when spread hot with butter. The butter
  soaks into the crumpet and drips down your chin as you bite them:)
  
  Strong white flour is the type bakers use for bread dough. High in
  gluten in makes a good risen batter or dough. In England we have
  'Crumpet Rings' which are metal, about 3" in diameter. These are
  placed into a fry pan and act as moulds while the crumpet cooks.
  Crumpets can be anywhere between 2" and 5" in diameter.
  
  Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl.  Gently warm the milk to
  just hand hot and sprinkle on the dried yeast. Leave to stand for 10
  or 15 minutes until frothy. Add the yeast mix to flour and beat to a
  smooth batter.  Cover with a damp cloth and leave to stand in a warm
  place for 45 minutes, or the batter has doubled in size. Dissolve the
  bicarb in 15ml of warm water and beat it into the batter.  Cover
  again and leave to stand for a further 20 minutes.  Place a 3 inch
  metal pastry cutter into a hot greased fry pan. Pour in about table
  spoon of the batter to cover the base thinly. Cook until the top is
  set and the bubbles have burst. Remove it from the ring, turn the
  crumpet over and cook the other side for 2 or 3 minutes only. It
  should just colour slightly. Cool on a wire rack. Eat them now, or
  leave to go cold and toast them until brown on both sides. Spread
  with lots of good butter and enjoy:) From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:)

 Categories: Digest, Oct., Lacto
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  English muffins
        x  Fatfree spaghetti sauce
        x  Kraft sharp ff cheese
 
  Max's Healthy Roman Fat Free Pizza review prompted me to send along
  this little quick lunch/dinner idea.  My (new) husband and I are
  often very rushed for dinner and such, and also wanted pizza without
  all the fat. So, we decided to try a new twist on an old favorite -
  English muffin pizzas! All we did was heat up some fatfree spaghetti
  sauce, toast english muffins, and cover with Kraft Free Sharp Cheddar
  (not really sharp, just good) cheese and mushrooms and other fatfree
  toppings. The sauce is usually enough to melt the cheese, but can
  easily be nuked. At 1 gram of fat for an english muffin (2 sides),
  you can't beat it! You also fill up really fast...

MMMMM-----------------------JUDI M. PHELPS----------------------------
      1 c  Black olives; sliced
      1 c  Cheddar cheese; shredded
    1/2 c  Onion; chopped
    1/2 c  Mayonnaise
           Cayenne to taste
      3    English muffins
 
  Combine above ingredients with exception of muffins.
  
  Split muffins in half and spread generously with mixture. Bake at 350
  degrees F for 5-10 minutes until puffy and hot.
  
  Marvelous for lunch with gazpacho and mixed green salad. Serves 6 for
  an appetizer 3 for a luncheon dish.
  
  Judi's Notes:  I have substituted 1/4 cup low-fat yogurt for the same
  amount of mayonnaise and it has been just as successful as using the
  whole amount of mayonnaise (saving some calories and still making a
  tasty dish).

MMMMM---------------------------SPONGE--------------------------------
    1/4 c  Warm Water (110oF)
      1 pn Sugar
      1 pk Active Dry Yeast
  1 1/2 c  Warm Milk (110oF)
      2 tb Unsalted Butter, cut in
           -small pieces and softened
      1 tb Honey
  2 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  1 1/4 ts Salt
  2 1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
           Cornmeal
 
  Sponge: Butter a 4 quart mixing bowl. In a small bowl, combine warm
  water and pinch sugar. Sprinkle yeast over water mixture. Let stand
  until yeast dissolves and bubbles. While yeast is dissolving, in
  buttered bowl combine warm milk, butter and honey. Stir until butter
  is almost melted. Stir in 2 1/2 cups flour and dissolved yeast. Beat
  on high speed for 3 minutes. Cover and let rise in warm place until
  doubled, about
       30    minutes.
  
  Dough: Butter a 4 quart bowl. Stir salt into bread mixture. Stir in
  enough of remaining flour with a wooden spoon until dough forms a
  ball. Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Knead until smooth
  and elastic, about 8-10 minutes, adding enough of remaining flour to
  keep dough from sticking. Place dough in buttered bowl, turning once
  to butter surface.
  
  Cover and let rise in a warm place until double, about 45 minutes.
  Punch dough down. Divide dough in half. Sprinkle board generously
  with cornmeal. Turn dough out on board. Sprinkle cornmeal over top of
  dough. Gently roll half the dough at a time 1/2" thick. Cut with a
  floured biscuit cutter into 3" rounds. Repeat with remaining half of
  dough. Knead, reroll, and cut dough scraps once, if desired. Arrange
  dough rounds on ungreased baking sheets 2" apart.
  
  Cover and let rise in a warm place until double, about 30 minutes.
  Heat a lightly oiled, nonstick griddle or skillet over medium-high
  heat. Lift some of the dough rounds with a spatula onto griddle. Cook
  for 2 minutes on each side. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, turning
  every few minutes, 13-18 minutes until done in center. Cool on racks.
  Repeat cooking remaining muffins. Split muffins in half crosswise
  with the tines of a fork.

 Categories: Breads, Muffins
      Yield: 20 Muffins
 
      1 c  Hot water
    1/2 c  Scalded milk
      2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 pk Yeast
      2 tb 85 deg water
      4 c  All-purpose flour
      3 tb Softened butter
 
  Remove tops and bottoms from Tuna cans and clean thoroughly to make
  good muffin rings.
  
  Combine the water, milk, sugar and salt. Dissolve the yeast in the 85
  deg water for 10 min. and add. Sift and beat in two cups of flour.
  Cover bowl with a damp towel and let the sponge rise for about 1 1/2
  hours or until the sponge collapses. Beat the butter in and knead in
  the remaining flour. Let the dough rise again until it doubles. Punch
  down and 1/2 fill the rings with dough. Let rise until doubled again.
  Cook until browned on a med hot well buttered griddle, turning once.
  Cool slightly on a rack and serve. They are best fresh and warm.

      Title: ENGLISH MUFFINS FROM SCRATCH
 Categories: Breads, Muffins
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Strong white flour
    1/2 oz Fresh yeast or 1/2 t. dried
           -yeast
      1 tb Sugar
    1/8 lb Butter, melted
      1 tb Salt
      8 oz Warm milk and water
 
  (The 8 oz. milk and water refers to 8 fluid ounces, or 250 ml.) Sift
  the flour and the salt into a bowl and leave it in a warm place.
  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/4 UK pint (about 1/2 cup--rsc) of
  the warm milk and water.  Leave to froth, then mix in the fat.  Stir
  all the liquid into the warm flour and beat well until smooth and
  elastic. Cover and prove in a warm place for 50 minutes or until
  doubled in bulk. Turn onto a well-floured board and knead, working in
  a little more flour if necessary to make the dough easier to shape.
  Round up the dough, roll into a thick sausage-shape, and divide into
  8 to 10 portions about 1 1/2 to 1-3/4 inches thick. Shape each one
  into a round with straight sides. Put onto a greased baking sheet,
  cover and put in a warm place to prove for 30-40 minutes or until
  spongy to the touch. Leave plenty of room for expansion, and be
  careful not to over-prove, as the muffins will lose their shape. Warm
  and grease bakestone (or other griddle) lightly. Lift the muffins
  carefully onto the bakestone and cook over very moderate heat for
  8-10 minutes, until pale gold underneath. Turn and cook the other
  side. Wrap in a cloth and keep warm if cooking in batches.  To serve,
  insert a knife in the side; then with fingers pull the top and bottom
  apart and insert thin slivers of butter.  (or tear in half with forks
  and toast.)  If reheating from cold, toast the top and bottom, then
  pull apart and butter. Source: Diane Duane, FidoNet Cooking Echo

  gets the flavor of the sherry. Top with a small dollop of Cool Whip
  Lite.
  
  If you're not watching sugar content or calories, the same recipe can
  be made with regular jam, regular jello and regular pudding mix.
  Looks best in a straight sided glass bowl. This has been a family
  favorite for Christmas since my childhood.

      Title: ENGLISH TRIFLE - GUY ATTWOOD
 Categories: British, Ethnic, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    To 2 small pound or sponge
           Cake - two days old
    3/4 c  Raspberry jam
      2    Half pints whipping cream
    3/4 c  Cream sherry (use a good one
      1    10 oz package frozen raspber
           Thawed and drained
      2    Recipes of custard (below)
           Chocolate drizzle
           -  not traditional

MMMMM--------------------------CUSTARD-------------------------------
      4    Egg yolks
     10 tb Whole milk (1/2 cup plus 2 T
      3 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Whipping cream
  2 1/2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in 2 Tb
    1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
 
  This recipe was given to me by my Grandmother who came over to
  America in 1895 from England. I have altered it slightly. As far as I
  know it is relatively original, or as original as any type of recipe,
  such as this, can be. It is not only addictive and decadent but
  pretty to look at as well. This is a special occasion dessert.
  
  Whisk yolks in a medium saucepan. Gradually add sugar, whisking until
  mixture is thick and lemon colored, about 1-2 minutes. Blend in milk,
  whipping cream and cornstarch mix. Place over medium low heat and
  cook, stirring constantly until mixture thickens, about 3-5 minutes.
  DO NOT BOIL OR MIXTURE WILL SEPARATE.  Remove from heat and stir
  until slightly cooled. Blend in vanilla and nutmeg. Transfer to a
  bowl and repeat process for the two required for TRIFLE.
  
  ASSEMBLY:  Whip the cream as your MaMa or Daddy taught you to do. In
  your prettiest large crystal bowl (salad bowl size) place a little
  less than half the whipped cream around the bottom and half way up
  the sides. Break 1/2 of the cakes into bite sized pieces and drop
  randomly all over the cream.  Drizzle sherry over all and drop
  dollops of jam and slightly less than half of the drained raspberries
  over the cake. Drizzle 1/2 of the thick but liquid custard over all.
  Repeat for the next layer, reserving some raspberries for the top.
  (Try to plan to end with a layer of jam and raspberries as the top of
  the Trifle.)  Finally, completely cover the top with the remaining
  whipped cream. Drizzle a little chocolate on top in any pattern you
  think looks good. Add a few raspberries and stand back to receive
  your raves.  To serve, merely scoop down and place on a pretty plate.
  
  NOTE:  Make about 4 hours before serving. Cover with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate.

  Comment from Sally: Pico de gallo (pee-coh day guy-yoh) translates as
  the Bite of the Rooster. I assume that is because the salsa (which
  merely means "sauce") called pico de gallo is quite fiery and has a
  fierce bite to it. Having never been bitten by a rooster, however, I
  can only offer this as conjecture. (grin)

      Title: ENSURING HIGH-QUALITY CANNED FOODS (PART 1 OF
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  Begin with good-quality fresh foods suitable for canning. Quality
  varies among varieties of fruits and vegetables. Many county
  Extension offices can recommend varieties best suited for canning.
  Examine food carefully for freshness and wholesomeness. Discard
  diseased and moldy food. Trim small diseased lesions or spots from
  food.
  
  Can fruits and vegetables picked from your garden or purchased from
  nearby producers when the products are at their peak of
  quality-within 6 to 12 hours after harvest for most vegetables. For
  best quality, apricots, nectarines, peaches, pears, and plums should
  be ripened 1 or more days between harvest and canning. If you must
  delay the canning of other fresh produce, keep it in a shady, cool
  place.
  
  Fresh home-slaughtered red meats and poultry should be chilled and
  canned without delay. Do not can meat from sickly or diseased
  animals. Ice fish and seafoods after harvest, eviscerate immediately
  and can them within 2 days.
  
  Maintaining Color and Flavor in Canned Food
  
  To maintain good natural color and flavor in stored canned food, you
  must:
  
  * Remove oxygen from food tissues and jars, * Quickly destroy the food
  enzymes, * Obtain high jar vacuums and airtight jar seals.
  
  Follow these guidelines to ensure that your canned foods retain
  optimum colors and flavors during processing and storage:
  
  * Use only high-quality foods which are at the proper maturity and
  are free of diseases and bruises.
  
  * Use the hot-pack method, especially with acid foods to be processed
  in boiling water
  
  * Don't unnecessarily expose prepared foods to air. Can them as soon
  as possible.
  
  * While preparing a canner load of jars, keep peeled, halved,
  quartered, sliced, or diced apples, apricots, nectarines, peaches,
  and pears in a solution of 3 grams (3,000 milligrams) ascorbic acid
  to 1 gallon of cold water. This procedure is also useful in
  maintaining the natural color of mushrooms and potatoes, and for
  preventing stem-end discoloration in cherries and grapes. You can get
  ascorbic acid in several forms:

      Title: ENSURING HIGH-QUALITY CANNED FOODS (PART 2 OF
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  Advantages of Hot-packing
  
  Many fresh foods contain from 10 percent to more than 30 percent air.
  How long canned food retains high quality depends on how much air is
  removed from food before jars are sealed.
  
  Raw-packing is the practice of filling jars tightly with freshly
  prepared, but unheated food. Such foods, especially fruit, will float
  in the jars. The entrapped air in and around the food may cause
  discoloration within 2 to 3 months of storage. Raw-packing is more
  suitable for vegetables processed in a pressure canner.
  
  Hot-packing is the practice of heating freshly prepared food to
  boiling, simmering it 2 to 5 minutes, and promptly filling jars
  loosely with the boiled food.
  
  Whether food has been hot-packed or raw-packed, the juice, syrup, or
  water to be added to the foods should also be heated to boiling
  before adding it to the jars. This practice helps to remove air from
  food tissues, shrinks food, helps keep the food from floating in the
  jars, increases vacuum in sealed jars, and improves shelf life.
  Preshrinking food permits filling more food into each jar.
  
  Hot-packing is the best way to remove air and is the preferred pack
  style for foods processed in a boiling-water canner At first, the
  color of hot-packed foods may appear no better than that of
  raw-packed foods, but within a short storage period, both color and
  flavor of hot-packed foods will be superior. Controlling Headspace
  
  The unfilled space above the food in a jar and below its lid is termed
  headspace. Directions for canning specify leaving 1/4-inch for jams
  and jellies, 1/2-inch for fruits and tomatoes to be processed in
  boiling water and from 1- to 1-1/4-inches in low- acid foods to be
  processed in a pressure canner This space is needed for expansion of
  food as jars are processed, and for forming vacuums in cooled jars.
  The extent of expansion is determined by the air content in the food
  and by the processing temperature. Air expands greatly when heated to
  high temperatures; the higher the temperature, the greater the
  expansion. Foods expand less than air when heated.

      Title: ENSURING SAFE CANNED FOODS (PART 1 OF 2)
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  Growth of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum in canned food may cause
  botulism--a deadly form of food poisoning. These bacteria exist
  either as spores or as vegetative cells. The spores, which are
  comparable to plant seeds, can survive harmlessly in soil and water
  for many years. When ideal conditions exist for growth, the spores
  produce vegetative cells which multiply rapidly and may produce a
  deadly toxin within 3 to 4 days of growth in an environment
  consisting of:
  
  * a moist, low-acid food * a temperature between 40 degrees F and 120
  degrees F * less than 2 percent oxygen
  
  Botulinum spores are on most fresh food surfaces. Because they grow
  only in the absence of air, they are harmless on fresh foods.
  
  Most bacteria, yeasts, and molds are difficult to remove from food
  surfaces. Washing fresh food reduces their numbers only slightly.
  Peeling root crops, underground stem crops, and tomatoes reduces
  their numbers greatly. Blanching also helps, but the vital controls
  are the method of canning and making sure the recommended
  research-based process times, found in these guides, are used.
  
  The processing times in these guides ensure destruction of the largest
  expected number of heat-resistant microorganisms in home-canned foods.
  Properly sterilized canned food will be free of spoilage if lids seal
  and jars are stored below 95 degrees F. Storing jars at 50 degrees F
  to 70 degrees F enhances retention of quality.
  
  FOOD ACIDITY AND PROCESSING METHODS
  
  Whether food should be processed in a pressure canner or boiling-water
  canner to control botulinum bacteria depends on the acidity in the
  food. Acidity may be natural, as in most fruits, or added, as in
  pickled food. Low-acid canned foods contain too little acidity to
  prevent the growth of these bacteria. Acid foods contain enough
  acidity to block their growth, or destroy them more rapidly when
  heated The term "pH" is a measure of acidity; the lower its value,
  the more acid the food. The acidity level in foods can be increased
  by adding lemon juice, citric acid, or vinegar.
  
  Low-acid foods have pH values higher than 4.6. They include red meats,
  seafood, poultry, milk, and all fresh vegetables except for most
  tomatoes. Most mixtures of low-acid and acid foods also have pH
  values above 4.6 unless their recipes include enough lemon juice,
  citric acid, or vinegar to make them acid foods. Acid foods have a pH
  of 4.6 or lower. They include fruits, pickles, sauerkraut, jams,
  jellies, marmalades, and fruit butters.
  
  Although tomatoes usually are considered an acid food, some are now
  known to have pH values slightly above 4.6. Figs also have pH values
  slightly above 4.6. Therefore, if they are to be canned as acid
  foods, these products must be acidified to a pH of 4.6 or lower with
  lemon juice or citric acid. Properly acidified tomatoes and figs are
  acid foods and can be safely processed in a boiling-water canner.
  
  Botulinum spores are very hard to destroy at boiling-water
  temperatures; the higher the canner temperature, the more easily they
  are destroyed. Therefore, all low-acid foods should be sterilized at
  temperatures of 240 degrees to 250 degrees F, attainable with
  pressure canners operated at 10 to 15 PSIG. PSIG means pounds per
  square inch of pressure as measured by gauge. The more familiar
  "PSIG" designation is used hereafter in this publication. At
  temperatures of 240 degrees to 250 degrees F, the time needed to
  destroy bacteria in low-acid canned food ranges from 20 to 100
  minutes. The exact time depends on the kind of food being canned, the
  way it is packed into jars, and the size of jars. The time needed to
  safely process low-acid foods in a boiling-water canner ranges from 7
  to 11 hours; the time needed to process acid foods in boiling water
  varies from 5 to
       85    minutes.
  
  PROCESS ADJUSTMENTS AT HIGH ALTITUDES
  
  Using the process time for canning food at sea level may result in
  spoilage if you live at altitudes of 1,000 feet or more (Plate 2).
  Water boils at lower temperatures as altitude increases. Lower
  boiling temperatures are less effective for killing bacteria.
  Increasing the process time or canner pressure compensates for lower
  boiling temperatures.
  
  Therefore, when following canning directions in this series, select
  the proper processing time or canner pressure for the altitude where
  you live. If you do not know the altitude, contact your local county
  Extension agent. An alternative source of information would be the
  local district conservationist with the Soil Conservation Service.

  EQUIPMENT AND METHODS NOT RECOMMENDED
  
  Open-kettle canning and the processing of freshly filled jars in
  conventional ovens, microwave ovens, and dishwashers are not
  recommended, because these practices do not prevent all risks of
  spoilage. Steam canners are not recommended because processing times
  for use with current models have not been adequately researched.
  Because steam canners do not heat foods in the same manner as
  boiling-water canners, their use with boiling-water process times may
  result in spoilage. It is not recommended that pressure processes in
  excess of 15 PSI be applied when using new pressure canning
  equipment. So-called canning powders are useless as preservatives and
  do not replace the need for proper heat processing. Jars with wire
  bails and glass caps make attractive antiques or storage containers
  for dry food ingredients but are not recommended for use in canning.
  One-piece zinc porcelain-lined caps are also no longer recommended.
  Both glass and zinc caps use flat rubber rings for sealing jars, but
  too often fail to seal properly.

      Title: ERUPTING VOLCANO CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      6    8" baked round cakes
           Brown & green Frosting
      1    Fresh egg w/shell scrubbed
           Clean
      1 sm Juice glass or
  1 1/2    Inch cookie cutter
      2    To 3 drops red food color
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 lb Dry ice
           Aluminum foil
      1    To 2 oz hot tap water
 
  Make six 8" round cakes using your favorite mix or buy cakes from a
  bakery.
  
  Buy two or three dollars worth of dry ice from an ice cream store the
  day you will need it. Keep the dry ice in freezer. Be sure to handle
  the dry ice with gloves or tongs just to be safe. f your ice cream
  store doesn't have dry ice just look in your local Yellow Pages
  telephone directory under "Dry Ice". It's wasy to find everywhere.
  
  Now use your juice glass or cookie cutter and cut out a hole in the
  center or the top two layers of cake. This hole will form a well in
  the center of the cake and hide the special effect.
  
  Now construct the Volcano cake, round pyramid style, on a cake
  platter or large dish. Trim each layer into seccessively smaller
  rounds and stack and frost them into mountain shape using the last
  two layers with the holes as its top.
  
  With a small piece of aluminum foil, line the well in the center of
  the volcano cake. Use the juice glass as a mold and form foil around
  the glass.
  
  Now frost the cake, smoothing out the small step-like ledges. Use
  chocolate frosting for the whole cake first. Then use green frosting
  as highlights around the mountain to resemble vegetation.
  
  When you are ready to serve the cake, make the "lava". Separate the
  cleaned egg and discard the yolk. Put the egg white in a small mixing
  bowl with 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar and 2-3 drops red food coloring. Beat
  until the egg white starts to thicken. You don't want stiff peaks to
  form, just a thick, foamy texture.
  
  Now place two or three small chunks of the dry ice into the
  foil-lined well of the cake and pour in the red egg mixture. Nothing
  much will happen yet. Now fill your juice glass with hot tap water
  and take the Volcano Cake and water to the table where yyour guests
  are. When you are ready to produce the Special Effect, simply pour
  one or two ounces of the hot water into the egg and dry ice mixture
  and your realistic Volcano Cake will erupt large quantities or
  orange, foamy "lava" and white "smoke" for several minutes while you
  serve your delighted guests pieces of genuine Erupting Volcano Cake.
  
  Alternate Foam Generating Technique: If you can't find dry ice in your
  area, you can still produce the foaming "Lava" effect. There will be
  no smoke, but you will have plenty of foamy lava. You will need a
  small, short juice glass or a shot glass that will fit snugly in the
  center of the Volcano Cake (a glass 3" tall and 1 1/2" in diameter
  would be perfect). You will also need one small box of Jell-o, one
  small bottle lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of bicarbonate of soda.
  Make Jell-o according to package directions. Let cool 15 minutes.
  When jello is still (not hot), fill juice glass 1/2 full with the
  warm jello. Pour in enough lemon juice so that the glass is almost
  full, or about 1/2" from the top. Place glass down into hole in the
  cake so lip of glass is flush with top of cake. You are now ready to
  produce the effect. When ready, put 1 tablespoon of bicarbonate of
  soda into the glass and briefly stir (1-2 seconds). Jello foam will
  immediately pour out the top of the glass and flow down the sides of
  the cake.

      Title: ESCARGOT & CHANTERELLE PIZZA
 Categories: Entrees
      Yield: 1 Pizza
 
      1 x  French bread dough
           -(Craig Claiborne's
           -French bread recipe
           -works well)
     10 oz French snails
           -(the smaller the better;
           -burgundy snails taste
           -best to me)
      2 oz Chanterelle mushrooms,
           -dried
  1 1/2 lb Raclette cheese,
           -shredded
      8 oz Tomato sauce
      2    Garlic cloves
      2 tb Parsley, fresh
    1/2 lb Butter
 
  Make the French Bread dough recipe at least 1 day beforehand if you
  can. Roll the dough out into the shape of a pizza, put it on a pizza
  pan,and set it aside. It will keep in the refrigerator overnight.
  
  Prepare the dried mushrooms according to published recipes (soak,
  wash, cut, resoak, wash, drain).
  
  If the snails are too large (larger than a garlic clove), then cut
  them in pieces.  Drain the snails well. Melt the butter in a baking
  dish, add the snails, crushed garlic, about 1/2 salt and ground black
  pepper to taste.
  
  Put the bread-dough pan on the top rack of the oven and the snails on
  the bottom rack of the oven, and cook them both for 10 minutes. Take
  them out.
  
  Spread the tomato sauce in an even layer on the bread, then sprinkle
  the Raclette cheese over it.  Add the snails, and then the mushrooms.
  Sprinkle with fresh parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Bake at 425
  degrees F. in the top rack for 12 minutes (bottom rack will burn the
  crust).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A pizza-like dish smothered in escargot and mushrooms -- I was
  recently at a potluck party where everyone was asked to bring an
  interpretation of "French pizza," what pizza would have tasted like
  if it had been invented in Rennes instead of in Naples. I concocted
  this dish for the occasion, and it was a success. If you aren't sure
  you like escargot, this is not the dish to experiment with! Yield: 1
  large pizza.
  
  *  The first time I made this recipe I made it with morel mushrooms.
  Their flavor overwhelmed even the garlic snails. It was good, but it
  didn't have the balance I was looking for. Chanterelles seem to fit
  better. If you're unable to find or afford chanterelles, you can
  substitute Chinese straw mushrooms, which are available in cans
  wherever Chinese groceries are sold. European dried mushrooms seem
  always to have rocks and dirt in them; Asian dried mushrooms never
  do.  I guess the Asians wash them better before they dry them. It's
  impossible to get all of the rocks out.
  
  *  Raclette cheese is so much better than any other kind of cheese in
  this recipe that it is worth looking for. If you absolutely cannot
  get it, use fondue cheese or a Gruyere.
  
  *  Raw butter also tastes more "authentic" in this recipe. What you
  really want to use is Normandy butter, but it's hard to get in North
  America. Alta Dena raw butter is available in California; it makes a
  noticeable difference in the flavor of the escargot. I don't know of
  any other states in which it is legal to buy raw butter.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Basic Brown Sauce (See
           -Sauces)
      2 tb Meat Extract (Such As
           -Bovril)
    1/4 c  Dry Sherry
 
  The Spanish in this sauce comes from the addition of sherry. The
  aromatic brown sauce goes very well with roast beef, ham, or pork and
  even tastes wonderful over baked potatoes. You can substitute Maderia
  for the sherry if you'd like a slightly sweeter sauce.
  
  Place the brown sauce in a medium-size saucepan and reduce over low
  heat by one third, about 15 minutes or more. Stir in the extract and
  simmer an additional 15 minutes. Add the sherry and cook gently for 5
  minutes longer. Serve immediately.
  
  Yield:  About 2 cups of sauce.

      Title: ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR TURKEY ROASTING
 Categories: Information, Holidays, Turkey
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Holiday Feasts
 
  Make sure you have the following:
    * A LARGE ROASTING PAN.
    * VEGETABLE OIL AND BUTTER, SALT AND PEPPER.
    * A TOWEL. You will have greater luck with the drumstick clamp if
  you grasp it and the slippery turkey with a towel.
    * AN INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER. This is your most important tool.
  With this, you don't need a roasting chart or a clock. Read the facts
  on the dial. If you don't have one, get one.
    * Also Make Sure You've Got o A TURKEY LIFTER. Some recipes out
  there ask the cook to  flip a hot turkey from breast to back during
  cooking, supposedly to distribute juices. Try this once and you'll
  let nature's browning take its course. But you will have to lift the
  turkey out. I recommend a turkey lifter. The best turkey lifter looks
  like snow chains but acts as a sling. Two strands of metal chain-link
  lie on the bottom of your roasting pan with handles draped over the
  side of the pan. The turkey rests on top of the sling. You simply
  grasp both handles and heave. This device will put an end to burned
  hands, greasy potholders and lost drumsticks.
    * FOIL. For great-looking turkeys, lay a sheet of loose foil over
  the bird halfway through cooking time. Make it loose, or you'll steam
  the bird you're attempting to roast. Also, you may need to wrap foil
  booties around the drumsticks so they don't get dry and crunchy.
    * BULB BASTER, OPTIONAL. Makes basting easy, but begs the question
  about basting at all. New thinking discourages basting. Basting
  causes streaking through the skin's sheen. Turkey skin is so thick
  that basting really can't penetrate it. Basting only keeps the cook
  busy.
    * A STRAINER. For straining clear juices for gravy.

 Categories: Cookies, Scandinavia, Christmas, Chocolate, Jw
      Yield: 8 Dozen
 
      2    1 oz squares unsweetened
           -chocolate
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1    Egg
      2 c  Cake flour
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Milk chocolate or white
           Chocolate chips or a mixture
      1 c  Seedless raspberry preserves
 
  Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler over hot not boiling water.
  Remove from heat and cool. Cream butter and sugar in a large bowl
  until light. Add egg and melted chocolate; beat until fluffy. Stir in
  cake flour, vanilla and salt until well blended. Cover and
  refrigerate until firm, about 1 hr.
  
  Preheat oven to 400. Lightly grease cookie sheets or line with
  parchment paper. Divide dough into 4 equal parts and divide each part
  into two pieces. Roll each piece into a rope 12" long on a lightly
  floured board. The ropes should be about the thickness of a finger.
  Place 2" apart on the prepared cookie sheets. With your finger tip,
  make an indentation along the length of each rope. Bake 8 min or
  until firm.
  
  Meanwhile melt the chocolate chips in a small bowl over hot water. If
  you are using both kinds of chocolate, melt separately. Stir until
  smooth. Stir preserves and spoon them into a pastry bag fitted with a
  1/4" tip. [You can use a plastic bag with a corner snipped off with
  scissors.]
  
  When you remove the cookies from the oven, press preserves down the
  indentation in each cookie strip. Return to the oven for 2 min and
  remove to wire racks. While cookies are still warm, drizzle melted
  chocolate over the tops and cut into 1" diagonal pieces. Refrigerate
  until the chocolate has set.
  
  This recipe was learned by my mate Roslind many Christmases ago from
  her first husband's grandmother, Esther Eskelson and has been a
  family favorite ever since.

  take about l
      1/2    hours.
    Punch the dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured counter.
  Knead the dough briefly to expel air bubbles. Grease two 8 1/2" x 4
  1/2" loaf pans. Divide the dough into two pieces and roll each piece
  out into a rectangle the same length as the pans. The rectangles
  should be about 1/4" thick. Roll up the dough the long way and place
  it in the pans. Cover the loaves with a damp towel and let them rise
  30-45 minutes, until they are about 1" over the top of the pans.
  While the loaves are rising, preheat the oven to 375F. Bake the
  loaves for 35-34 minutes, or until well browned and the bottoms sound
  hollow when thumped. Cool the loaves on a rack. Yield: Two loaves,
  each yielding sixteen 1/2 inch slices.

      Title: ETHIOPIAN AMBASHA
 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water
      2 tb Ground coriander
      1 ts Ground cardamom
    1/2 ts White pepper
      1 ts Ground fenugreek
      2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
  1 1/4 c  Lukewarm water
      5 c  Unbleached flour
      1 tb Cayenne
      2 tb Oil
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
      1 pn Ground cloves
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
 
  Dissolve the yeast in warm water for 10 minutes. Add the coriander,
  cinnamon, white pepper, fenugreek, salt, oil and lukewarm water, and
  stir well. Slowly add the flour until a mass forms. On a floured
  board, knead the dough for 10 minutes or until it is smooth and tiny
  bubbles form. (note: this recipe makes a stickier dough than usual)
  
  Reserve a 1-inch piece of dough. With floured hands spread the dough
  out on an ungreased pizza pan. Using a sharp knife, score the dough
  in a design similar to the spokes of a bicycle wheel. Place the
  reserved ball of dough in the center of the scored dough. Cover and
  let rise one hour.
  
  Bake at 350F  for an hour or until golden brown. Combine the topping
  ingredients in a small bowl. While still warm brush the bread with
  topping. Yield: 1 16-inch loaf.

  Combine ginger, onion, and garlic, and pound to a coarse paste with a

  Melt the butter over low heat, stirring constantly, taking care that
  it does not darken. Skim off the foam as it rises and continue
  cooking until all the foam is gone.
  
  Add the paste and all remaining ingredients to the butter and simmer,
  uncovered, at the lowest possible heat, stirring occasionally, for 30
  minutes.
  
  Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Pour off the transparent top
  layer and reserve it, leaving behind as much of the milk solids and
  spices as possible. Strain the transparent layer through several
  layers of cheesecloth. The butter will usually be an oil at room
  temperature and will solidify in the refrigerator, where it can be
  kept, covered, for 3 or 4 months.

      Title: ETHIOPIAN FLAT BREAD (INJERA)
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      3 c  Self-rising flour (750 ml)
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour (125 ml)
    1/2 c  Cornmeal or masa harina (125
           Ml)
      1 tb Active dry yeast (one
           Package) (15 ml)
  3 1/2 c  Warm water (875 ml)
 
  Mix and let set in large bowl, covered, an hour or longer, until
  batter rises and becomes stretchy. It can sit as long as 3-6 hours.
  When ready, stir batter if liquid has settled on bottom. Then whip in
  blender, 2 cups of batter at a time, thinning it with 1/2 - 3/4 cup
  water. Batter will be quite thin. Cook in non-stick frypan WITHOUT
  OIL (is that a great instruction or what?) over medium or medium-high
  heat. Use 1/2 cup batter per injera for a 12-inch pan or 1/3 cup
  batter for a 10-inch pan. Pour batter in heated pan and quickly swirl
  pan to spread batter as thin as possible. Batter should be no thicker
  than 1/8-inch. Do not turn over. Injera does not easily stick or
  burn. It is cooked through when bubbles appear all over the top. Lay
  each injera on a clean towel for a minute or two, then stack in
  covered dish to keep warm. Finished injera will be thicker than a
  crepe, but thinner than a pancake.
  
  To serve, overlap a few injera on a platter and place stews on top (I
  think most kinds of spicy bean or veggie stews/curries would be great
  with this.
   For Ethiopian food, the spicier the better). Or lay one injera on
  each dinner plate, and ladle stew servings on top. Give each person
  three or more injera, rolled up or folded in quarters, to use for
  scooping up the stews.
  
  I calculated that if you make 15 12-inch injeras, each would be about
  120 calories, 3% CFF.  Not bad.  For a more authentic injera, add 1/2
  cup teff flour (teff is a kind of millet) and reduce the whole wheat
  flour to
      1/4    cup.

    1/2 ga Catsup
      1 sm Bottle Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Vinegar
      3    Cloves garlic -- crushed

           Taste
 
  Mix and simmer. Add a dash of Tabasco and/or mustard for hotness till
  it tastes right. "Don't put it on the meat while cooking 'cause you
  will cause the sugar to caramelize and char. This used to be a secret
  but since I'm retired it makes no-never-mind. I makes more money now
  after I retired. If I knew I could make this much money as a retiree,
  I would have quit working when I was 20." (By "retired" Euel means he
  now runs a private catering company and cooks only for those who
  wisely seek out his skills.)

      Title: EVA'S BEANS
 Categories: Beans, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Pinto beans *
      1 lg White onion, chopped
      4    To 5 fresh tomatoes, peeled,
           -seeded and chopped **
      1 lb Lean bacon, cut into squares
      1 tb Mexican oregano
      1    Sprig Epasote
      1 tb Ground cumin
     12 oz Beer
           Water ***
      1 bn Cilantro, chopped
      2    To 12 fresh jalapeno
           -peppers, seeded, cut into
           -fine slivers.
 
  Salt to taste
  
  *(NOT soaked, but rinsed well, and the rocks, etc.picked out) **
  (substitute canned, if you like) *** to cover the beans by about 2
  inches (you may need to add more HOT water as they cook)
  
  In a large pot, put the beans, bacon, oregano and cumin. Add the
  beer, and water.  Simmer until the beans are almost tender (maybe 1 -
  1 1/2 hours). Add the tomatoes and jalapenos, and cook until beans
  are fully tender. Add the cilantro, and re-heat for about a half
  hour. Salt to taste.
  
  These make a good basic bean.  If you want a bean soup, remove about a
  quarter of the beans, and mash with a potato masher. Return to the
  pot.
  
  Eva insisted that these beans HAD to be consumed the same day they
  were cooked.  I've found they will be almost as good reheated the
  next day, and if drained of most of their liquid, they make killer
  refried beans.
  
  She served them as a separate course, after the meat ~- I like them
  as an accompaniment to grilled or barbecued meat, or as a meal in
  themselves, when served with a lot of fresh tortillas or homemade
  bread.

  recipe."

  bamboo shoots, nimiature corn, asparagus, cucumbers, zucchini,

      2 lb Pork butt with fat; cut into
           -1-1/2 inch cubes
      2 c  Water
      3 tb Chile caribe
  1 1/2 tb Kosher salt
      4    Cloves garlic; roasted and
           -chopped
    1/3 c  Chopped onion
      2    Cloves
      1 ts Fennel seed
      2 ts Cumin seed
      1    Stick cinnamon
      1 tb Dried Mexican oregano
 
  Put pork, water, chile, salt, garlic and onion in a heavy saucepan and
  bring to a low simmer. Roast spices and oregano in a dry saute pan
  over medium heat until fragrant.
  
  In a spice mill, grind spices and oregano to a powder. Add the pork
  and continue to simmer, uncovered, for 1-1/2 hours until tender,
  adding more water as needed. Increase heat and cook until all liquid
  has evaporated. Reduce heat slightly and continue to cook, stirring
  until the cubes of meat are a mahogany brown. Let cool.
  
  Note: Pork is the most traditional filling for tamales in Central
  Mexico. Pork has more natural moisture than beef and so makes a good
  filling for tamales. This recipe provides a useful means of using up
  ends of loins or other cuts of pork not used for entrees. The flavors
  of tropical fruit and pork go particularly well together, which is
  why the Manchamantel sauce is the perfect accompaniment for this
  tamale.

      Title: EXPLANATION OF KOSHER
 Categories: Information, Passover
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           ANNE NEIWIRTH   (JKBC80B)
 
  Thanks, everyone for your lovely compliments on my explanation to
  Nancy Johnson. And Nancy, if you're reading this, everyone else has
  done a super job of filling you in on what "kosher" means. However, I
  don't think anyone mentioned the source of "kosher," and that is, of
  couse, the Bible. The word kosher, or Kasher, to use a more correct
  pronounciation, means "fit" or "proper."
  
  In the Bible, we have laws given to the Jews by God about what foods
  we may and may not eat. There has been much speculation down through
  the ages about the reason for these laws: health, cleanliness, etc.
  But the true reason, our Rabbis tell us, is because we were commanded
  by God to follow these laws, and to set us apart as a holy people. In
  fact, Nancy, even though only about 10 percent of all Jews observe
  the dietary laws, it is probably these same laws that have allowed
  the Jews to survive as a people for 4,000 years.
  
  Kosher animals, as the others have mentioned, include cows, lambs,
  goats, sheep, deer. A kosher four-legged animal is one that both
  chews its cud and has a cloven hoof. Therefore, pig is not a kosher
  animal. In the category of fowl, chicken, goose, duck, turkey (there
  are a few others as well) are kosher. There is a list of birds in the
  Bible that we are forbidden to eat. No reason is given, but the thing
  they have in common is that they are birds of prey.
  
  We are permitted to eat fish that have fins and scales, therefore cod,
  flounder, salmon, tuna, mahi mahi, mackerel, trout, etc are kosher.
  Shrimp, lobster, eel, clam, crab, squid etc. are not. We are not
  permitted to eat things that creep or crawl on their bellies, for
  instance, reptiles (alligator or lizard or snake), or insects.
  
  Fruits and vegetables are all kosher, as are eggs of kosher animals.
  It may interest you to know that Adam and Eve were vegetarians, and
  some believe that man was meant to be a vegetarian, in the best of
  all possible worlds. It was only after they were thrown out of the
  garden of Eden that they were permitted to kill animals for their
  food.
  
  Speaking of killing animals, our kosher animals must be ritually
  slaughtered in order to be fit for us to eat. It means slaughtering
  in a way that caused the animal the least pain; produces the quickest
  death, and drains out as much blood as possible. We are not permitted
  to eat the blood; it is the life of the animal. That's why kohser
  butchers (and in the old days, housewives) soak and salt the meat to
  drain out even more blood. Because of the requirements of slaughter,
  observant Jews do not hunt, nor will they eat an animal that has been
  shot, bludgeoned, or that has died a natural death. Kosher
  slaughterhouses employ a Rabbi who oversees the slaughtering process
  and who ascertains that it has been done properly. You might imagine
  that kosher meat costs more, and it does! Looks like I'm out of room

  the edges of dough rounds, then fold empty half of dough round over
  the filling, forming a crescent shape. Press or decoratively pinch
  edges to seal.
  
  Place 3 calzones on each baking sheet; brush each calzone with oil
  and bake in a 400 oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden brown.

  Crust: I just unrolled it out of the package, layed it on top of the
  pie dish that I'd sprayed with Pam and pressed it in. I used kitchen
  scissors and cut off the excess.
  
  Mix everything in a blender and pour into crust.  I only have a deep
  dish pie plate, so I doubled this recipe (I actually made 2 seperate
  batches). I brushe d the crust with skim milk, wrapped aluminum foil
  around the edges and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. When I take it
  to my mother's house tomorrow, I will brush the edges again, and
  probably bake it for 15 minutes, just to brown the crust.

      2 lb Beef skirt steak
    1/2 c  Fresh lime juice
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Salt and pepper
      8 ea Flour tortillas, 8-inch

MMMMM-------------------------CONDIMENTS------------------------------
           Sour cream
           Chopped cilantro
           Grated cheddar cheese
           Shredded monterey jack

           Jicama, chopped
           Onion
           Green bell pepper, etc.
 
  Flank steak is a bood substitute for skirt steak cut from legs of
  beef. It's lean, and some people find it too tough. Citrus marinade
  helps to tenderize it. Make sure the membrane is cut. If using flank,
  cut meat into strips. For chicken fajitas, use skinless boneless
  chicken breasts. Do not marinade for more than 60 minutes. -- Beth

  Gayle Schuck of Bismarck, North Dakota, waxes nostalgic at the
  thought of family picnics at LaMoure County Memorial Park in Grand
  Rapids, North Dakota. The James River encircles the park and its
  tennis courts, ball diamond and playground, including the old,
  squeaky merry-go-round. Brown sugar and bacon season Gayle's baked
  quartet of canned pork and beans, butter beans, kidney beans, and
  green beans.
  
  1.  In a dutch oven, cook bacon and onion till bacon is browned and
  onion
      is tender.  Drain off the fat.
  
  2.  Stir in the remaining ingredients.  Transfer the mixture to a 3
  1/2 or
        4    quart crockery cooker.
  
  3.  Cover; cook on low heat setting for 6 hours. Makes 10-12 servings.
  
  Oven Method:  In a medium skillet, cook bacon and onion till bacon is
  tender.  Drain off fat.  In a 2 quart baking dish, combine th bacon
  mixture with remaining ingredients. Cover and bake in a 350 deg. oven
  for 30 minutes.  Uncover and bake for 15 minutes more.
  
  Picnic Hint:  Leave the beans in the crockery cooker container or
  baking dish.  Place the cooker in an insulated cooler or wrap in
  towels to keep warm for the trip to your favorite picnic spot.
  
  Gayle Schuck of Bismarck, N.D. often adds a pound of cooked and
  drained lean ground beef to this hotdish. Or take along fully cooked
  bratwurst to heat on the grill.

           Divided
      2 lg Garlic Cloves -- peeled &
           Chopped
      1 oz Pancetta -- chopped fine
      6 lg Fresh Sage Leaves -- -or-
      1 ts Dried Whole Leaf Sage
           Salt And Black Pepper -- to
           Taste
      1    Tomato -- core/peel/chop
           Fine
      1 lb Medium Shrimp -- peeled &
           Deveined
 
  * such as cannellini, Great Northern or navy beans
  
  Note:  The beans in this recipe will need to be soaked overnight
  
  Put the beans in a non aluminum container and cover with 5 inches of
  codl water.  Soak overnight and then drain well. Place them with all
  other ingredients except the salt (see note) and shrimp, in a pot
  that will comfortably hold them all.
  
  Pour enough cold water over the ingredients to cover them by about 3
  inches. Cook gently at a simmer for about 1 hour or more. The liquid
  in the beans should be mostly absorbed by the time they finish
  cooking and the beans shoul dbe very moist and succulent. Do not let
  them go dry. Add the salt to taste.  Serve the beans hot, drizzled
  with olive oil; they are equally good at room temperature.
  
  Sautee the shrimp in the olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper for
  about 2 minutes, stirring often. Do not overcook. Serve the shrimp
  with warm beans or slightly chilled with room temperature beans.
  
  Note:  Adding salt to beans before they are fully cooked toughens
  them.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.
  
  NOTES: The beans are delicious without shrimp. They make a tasty
  accompaniment to roast or grilled meat, fowl or fish. If you increase
  the amount of cooking water, you an have a delectable baean soup.

      Title: FAILED-FUDGE BAVARIAN CREAM
 Categories: Pudding
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Recipe failed fudge, soupy
      2 tb Unflavored gelatin; (2
           -envelopes or 1/2 ounce)
      2 lg Egg whites
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  If fudge doesn't harden and is very, very runny, turn it into a
  Bavarian Cream.
  
  Take 1/2 cup runny fudge and sprinkle gelatin over it. Allow to sit
  until gelatin softens and swells. Dissolve gelatin completely by
  microwaving on medium (50%) for 15 to 30 seconds, or by placing over
  hot water. Mix warmed fudge back into the rest of fudge and let cool
  to room temperature. Beat egg whites, adding cream of tartar when
  they become frothy. Continue beating to stiff peaks, and fold into
  fudge mixture. Beat cream in chilled bowl using chilled beaters until
  stiffened but not thick--it should hold soft peaks--and fold into
  fudge mixture. Pour into 6-cup mold and chill until ready to serve.

      Title: FAILED-FUDGE BROWNIES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Pan
 
      2 c  Failed fudge
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  Good use of failed fudge: fudge that is too hard, too soft, too
  runny, too sugary, too chewy, etc.
  
  Proportions are as follows: for every 2 cups (roughly 1 pound yield)
  of any failed fudge that is not runny, you'll need 1 egg, 1/2 cup
  all-purpose flour, and 1/2 cup milk. If fudge is soupy, halve the
  milk (to 1/4 cup). If fudge is as thin as bouillon, eliminate the
  milk.
  
  Mix egg, milk, and flour together until mixture is smooth, then stir
  into fudge mixture. Bake in buttered 8x8-inch pan in preheated 325'F
  oven for 40 to 45 minutes. A cake tester inserted around the edge
  should come out clean; center will obviously still be soft. Place on
  rack to cool.

    1/4 c  Salt
 
  Place brisket in heavy stock pot and cover with water. Mix all
  seasoning together except salt. Put all ingredients in a cheese-cloth
  bag and tie together. Boil brisket and seasoning together with salt
  for 2-1/2 to 3 hours. To test, stick a fork in the middle of brisket;
  it should come out easy when done. Cool and slice. Pour a little of
  the stock over the brisket for added flavor. Serve with your favorite
  smothered cabbage recipe. This recipe is from the Fair Grounds Race
  Track in New Orleans. They are famous for their corned beef. This

  heavy pan with a lid. Remove the chicken and set aside. Brown chopped
  onion in the remaining oil. Add walnuts and cook gently for a minute
  or so. Add juice of pomegranates and lemon, brown sugar, cinnamon,
  and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and return the
  chicken to the pan. Cook gently for 1 1/2 hours until very tender.
  Taste and adjust the sweet-sour balance if necessary. Serve over
  steamed rice and scatter over the dish the seed sacs of the remaining
  half pomegranate and a handful of coarsely chopped walnuts.

           PASTRY:
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      1 tb Sugar
      1 pn Salt
     12 tb Unsalted buter
      3 tb Ice water
           FILLING:
      3 c  Blueberries
      4 tb Sugar
      2 tb Flour
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Put the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse
  once. Cut the butter into pieces and add to the dry ingredients.
  Pulse again until the mixture resembles coarsely ground cornmeal.
  (You may also cut the butter into the flour mixture with two knives
  or a pastry cutter.) Add the ice water through the feeder tube with
  the motor running and briefly process until a ball is formed. Wrap
  the dough in wax paper and refrigerate for 1/2 hour. Faith makes ice
  water by adding a few cubes to a glass of water before sh starts
  making the dough. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and
  line a 10" fluted tarte pan -97 the kind with the bottom that comes
  out. Prick the bottom of the dough-lined pan with a fork. Combine 2
  tbsps. of flour with 2 tbsps. of sugar and dust the bottom. Add the
  lemon juice to the fruit and spread evenly over the dough. Sprinkle 2
  tbsps. of sugar on the top and place on baking sheet. Bake in the
  middle of a preheated 375F oven for 40 minutes, or until the edges
  turn slightly brown. Let coo for ten minutes and remove from the pan
  to a serving plate Tastes best warm or at room temperature Serves 10.
  This recipe is also delicious with other summer fruits. Caution: do
  not use frozen blueberries or you will have a soggy mess. Pix knows.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 oz Plain cream cheese -- room
           Temperature
      4 oz Chevre (100% goat's milk
           Cheese)
           Fresh Herbs -- to taste
 
  Herbed chevre is readily available in most markets and cheese shops.
  Pix likes to keep things simple and buys the herbed variety. Combine
  the cheeses by hand. The cream cheese makes the combination easier to
  spread. If you are using your own herbs, rosemary, tarragon, and
  summer savory are good choices, alone or in combination. * * * Use
  the spread to stuff snow or sugar snap peas, spread on cucumber or
  zucchini rounds, sweetmeal biscuits, water biscuits, or slightly
  toasted miniature bagels.

      8 oz Plain cream cheese -- room

      1 c  Chutney
 
  Cream the chutney and cheese together by hand. Do not use a food
  processor or blender otherwise you end up with cheese sauce.
  
  Choice of chutney:  Pix uses her own green tomato chutney, which is a
  spicy combination of tomatoes, onions, raisins, and walnuts. All and
  any varieties of chutney work well. * * * Use the spread to stuff
  snow or sugar snap peas, spread on cucumber or zucchini rounds,
  sweetmeal biscuits, water biscuits, or slightly toasted miniature
  bagels. The chutney spread makes a tasty sandwich when combined with
  smoked turkey or Virginia ham or by itself on date and nut or
  buckwheat walnut bread.

      Title: FAJITAS WITH STIR-FRIED CHICKEN
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Chicken Breasts,
      1 x  (skinless & boneless)
    1/2 c  Lemon Juice
      6 tb Coriander, fresh chopped
      1 x  (or parsley)(both optional)
      4 ts Cumin
      2 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
      8 ea Flour Tortillas
      1 c  Salsa, mild red or green
      8 ea Romaine lettuce leaves,large
      2 tb Vegetable Oil
    1/2 c  Sour Cream
 
  1. Preheat the oven to 200. 2. Cut the chicken breast crosswise into
  1/4-inch-thick strips. Place the chicken in a small bowl. 3. Add 6
  tablespoons of the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the coriander (if
  using), the cumin, cornstarch, salt and pepper and mix gently until
  the chicken is well coated; set aside. 4. Stack the tortillas and
  wrap them in foil. Place them in the oven to warm for 5 to 10
  minutes. 5. Maenwhile make the sauce: In a small bowl, stir together
  the salsa and the remaining 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 4
  tablespoons of coriander (if using). 6. Shred the lettuce. 7. In a
  medium skillet, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken
  and saute until white and firm, about 5 minutes. 8. Place the
  tortillas, chicken, shredded lettuce, sauce and sour cream in serving
  dishes. The diners can then assemble their own fajitas by topping a
  tortilla with some of each of the ingredients, ending with a dollop
  of sour cream, and then rolling it up. TIME-SAVERS: MICROWAVE TIP:
  Just before serving, stack the tortillas and wrap them in a damp
  paper towel. Cook at 100% for 1 minute. DO-AHEAD: Since the fajitas
  are fine served at room temperature, much of the preparation can be
  done ahead of time. The sauce (Step 5) can be made and the chicken
  marinated in advance. Just be sure to cook the chicken and warm the
  tortillas as close to serving time as possible.

 Categories: Candies, Fake
      Yield: 1 Pound
 
      1 c  Butter
      1 c  Sugar
      3 tb Water
      1 ts Light corn syrup
      1 c  Fine chop toasted almonds
      1 c  Milk-chocolate chips
 
  Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the sugar, water, and corn syrup.
  Cook the mixture over med. heat, stirring. When the sugar dissolves
  and the mixture begins to boil, raise the heat and bring the mixture
  to 290~F degrees on a cooking thermometer. This is called the
  soft-crack stage. It will be light brown in color, and syrup will
  separate into threads that are not brittle when dribbled into cold
  water. Quickly stir in 1/2 cup chopped almonds.  Immediately pour the
  mixture onto an ungreased baking sheet. Wait 2 or 3 minutes for the
  candy surface to firm, then sprinkle on the chocolate chips. In a few
  minutes, when the chips have softened, spread the chocolate evenly
  over the surface. Sprinkle the remaining almonds over the melted
  chocolate.  When the chocolate hardens, crack the candy into pieces.
  Store covered. VARIATIONS: To get a candy more like the Heath bar or
  Hersheys Skor, follow the same directions above except omit step 9.

      Title: FAKE GUACAMOLE
 Categories: Dips, Mexican
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    16 oz bag of frozen peas,
           Thawed
      1 sm Can medium hot green chilis
    1/4 c  Chopped onion
    3/4 ts Garlic powder
      1 tb Red chili powder
      4 tb Your favorite salsa (or
           Chopped
           Tomatoes)
      1 tb "Imo"
           Cumin to taste
           Salt and pepper to taste
           Any other spices you enjoy
           In guacamole
 
   Much lower in fat than real quacamole.  Try this recipe, you'll be
  surprised! Thaw the peas by placing them in a colander and running
  them under lukewarm tapwater. To test if they're thawed, pop one in
  your mouth occasionally.  Once thawed (it should only take 1-2
  minutes), drain thoroughly and pour the peas into a blender or food
  processor.
   Puree the peas in the blender or food processor. Place pureed peas
  in a ceramic bowl and mix in the remaining ingredients. Refrigerate
  for several hours to let the flavors blend. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

      Title: FAKE HARDEE'S FRENCH FRIES
 Categories: Vegetables, Fake, Side dish
      Yield: 5 Dozen
 
      6 c  Vegetable oil
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 c  Warm water
      2 lg Russett potatoes, peeled
           Salt
 
  Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over low-med. heat for about 20
  minutes. In a med. bowl, mix the sugar into the water until
  dissolved. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise, and then into 1/4"
  strips. Put the potatoes into the sugar solution and soak for 15
  minutes. Remove the potatoes and dry them thoroughly on paper towels.
  The right oil temperature is crucial here. To test the oil, fry a
  couple of potato slices for 6 minutes. Remove and cool, then taste.
  The fries should no get too dark too soon and should be soft in the
  middle.  If the oil is too hot, turn it down and test again. The
  fries should not be undercooked, either. If they are, turn up the
  heat. When the oil temperature is just right, put all of the potato
  slices in the oil for 1 minute.  This is the blanching stage. Take
  the fries out of the oil and let them cool. When the fries have
  cooled, place them into the oil again for 5 minutes, or until golden
  brown. Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel-covered plate.
  Salt to taste.

  Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan.  Cover and cook over

  heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has completely dissolved.
  Remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool. Be sure to keep it
  covered. Store in any empty bottle with a screw top or another bottle
  with a resealable lid. Note: It is very important that you use a
  covered saucepan when making this drink.  the alcohol will boil away
  if the solution is not covered when it gets hot. Also,the longer this
  drink is bottled and stored in a dark, cool place, the better it will
  taste. For the best flavor, store it for at least thirty days before
  drinking. Makes great gifts. Source:  Top Secret Recipes by Todd

      Title: FAKE KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken fryer parts
           Seasoning Paste:
      2 pk Italian Dressing mix**
      3 tb Flour
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Lemon juice (or vinegar)
      2 tb Margarine or cooking oil
           Coating Mix:
      2 c  Milk, club soda or beer
           Dry pancake mix
           For Frying:
  1 1/2 pt Cooking oil
 
  **Note: Use the Good Seasoning brand Italian or Mild Italian Dressing
  Mix right from the package.
  
  Begin with about 3 lbs fryer parts. Cut the breast pieces in half.
  Fries much quicker when pieces are small.
  
  Combine Seasoning Paste ingredients (dressing mix, flour, salt, lemon
  or vinegar, and margarine or oil) . Spread this paste evenly over
  chicken pieces. Stack in a bowl; cover and refrigerate at least two
  hours or better yet, overnight. About 1 hour before serving, heat
  about 1 1/2 pints cooking oil in a heavy saucepan ( 9 inches in
  diameter,with the depth of oil of about 3 inches) to a temperature of
  425 degrees.
  
  I prefer my Oster Super Cooker, but using an electric deep fryer I
  would have the temperature at about 400 degrees. Put about 2 cups
  milk or club soda or beer in a deep, narrow bowl & dip each piece
  chicken in the liquid, letter the excess drip off. Dust lightly but
  evenly in Aunt Jemima Pancake Flour ( or a good brand ).DO NOT
  OVERCOAT!!! Dry pieces a few minutes without letting them touch each
  other. Fry a few pieces at a time. Place on a cookie sheet without
  letting them touch each other and bake at 350F uncovered for 30
  minutes. Serves 6-8 persons.
  
  I encourage you to experiment with amount of salad dressing mix
  according to your own taste preferences, but much of it washes off in
  the milk so 2 packages are at least needed.

      Title: FAKE PANFORTE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      1 lb Assorted dried fruit*
    1/4 lb Assorted nuts**
           Chopped medium fine
      1    Egg
      4 tb Oil or margarine,
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Caster sugar
    1/4 ts Each nutmeg,cloves
           And ginger
      1 pn Salt, generous
 
  (You can, of course, use half quantities, but stay with a whole egg).
  *(dates, prunes, raisins, apricots etc., but no apples
     or bananas), stoned or pitted where applicable **(macadamia,
  almonds, pecan, hazel etc., but not peanuts), Mix all the ingredients
  thoroughly, add enough water to make a semi-soft dough, and let stand
  for at least 4 hrs. By then the dried fruit will have soaked up some
  of the water and made the dough rather stiff.
  
  Line big shallow baking form with oiled paper, pour dough and pat it
  flat and even with a spatula. Cover with oiled paper, and bake on
  medium heat for ca. 45 mins. This seems a long time, but the aim is
  to get the finished product as dry as possible without charring. This
  way it keeps indefinitely and tastes nearly as good as the original
  panforte which is quite hard to find.

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 12 Pieces
 
      1 c  Peanut butter
    1/3 c  Powdered sugar
     12 oz Hershey's milk-chocolate
           --chips
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  In a small bowl, mix the peanut butter and powdered sugar until firm.
  Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler over hot, not boiling,
  water.
  
  You may also melt them in a microwave oven set on HIGH for 2 minutes,
  stirring halfway through the heating time. Add the salt. Grease the
  muffin-tin cups and spoon some chocolate into each cup, filling
  halfway. With a spoon, draw the chocolate up the edges of each cup
  until all sides are coated.  Cool in the refrigerator until firm.
  Spread about a teaspoon of peanut butter onto the chocolate in each
  cup, leaving room for the final chocolate layer.  Pour some chocolate
  onto the top of each candy and spread it to the edges. Let sit at
  room temperature, or covered in the refrigerator.  Turn out of the
  pan when firm. Note: It is best to use a shallow muffin tin or candy
  tin for this recipe. If you only have the regular-size muffin tin,
  simply fill each tin only halfway with the chocolate and peanut
  butter, unless you want to make giant-size mutant peanut butter cups,
  then fill those cups all the way! Source: Todd Wilbur's book: Top

      Title: FALL FEAST - DINNER MENU PREPARATION SCHEDULE
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Schedule
 
MMMMM-------------------------INFO ONLY------------------------------
 
  Even the quickest dinners need a certain amount of organization! In
  this case you'll have to cheat a little, making the meringue [Fall
  Feast - Pavlova} a day or two ahead of time.
  
  Keep it in a cool place, but not in the fridge, since refrigeration
  makes the meringue sticky.
  
  The remainder of the mean can be prepared in under one hour.
  
  First dice the vegetables for the chowder and get the soup cooking.
  Then dice the vegetables for the pork dish, saut the pork and
  vegetables and place them in the oven, as directed.
  
  While the meat cooks, prepare the homestyle potatoes.
  
  Finish by garnishing the dessert.
  
  The pork and the potatoes will be ready at the same time, so keep
  them warm while you finish the sauce for the pork. The soup and
  potatoes reheat well, but the pork is best served as soon as it is
  cooked.
  
  Drinks:
  
  A cocktail to start the proceedings: Keglevish [sweetened lemon vodka]
  mixed with cranberry juice and topped up with soda, or a glass of
  semi-dry Riesling.
  
  First course [soup]: Chardonnay, California Fetzer Sundial, Australian
  Koonunga Hill, Sauvignon Blanc, or Belgian lambic beer.
  
  Main Course [Pork]: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir - California Calera Central
  Coast, or Burgundy - Latour Pinot Noir, or Beaujolais.
  
  Dessert [Meringue]: Suaternes, Fontanafredda Asti
  
  with coffee: Calvados VSOP - a French apple brandy.

      Title: FALL SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8    Handfuls chicory greens
           -(hearts of escarole or
           - curly endive, raddichio,
           -  Belgian endive)
      3    Bartlett or Comice pears
     12    Whole walnuts
           Walnut oil (optional)
      4 oz Gorgonzola Dolcelatte
           - crumbled
     10    Branches chervil or parsley
           Freshly milled pepper

MMMMM------------------------VINAIGRETTE-----------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Pear or champagne vinegar
           -or to taste
           Salt
      3 tb Virgin olive oil
      3 tb Walnut oil
 
  SEPARATE LEAVES OF WHICHEVER type of green you're using. If using
  escarole or curly endive, use just the pale inner leaves. (Outer
  leaves can be sauteed with garlic and chile-- delicious!) Gently cut
  or tear leaves into attractive pieces, wash and dry them and set
  aside. To cut pears, stand them upright and slice off a round from
  the side. Work your way around the pear, slicing it thinly into
  crescent-shaped pieces. If walnuts are really fresh, simply crack
  them and break them into quarters and eighths. If they aren't so
  fresh, toss them in a little walnut oil and toast them at 350F until
  lightly roasted, about 7 minutes. Prepare vinaigrette and use half of
  it to dress the leaves. Set them on salad plates. Dress pears with
  remaining vinaigrette and settle them into leaves. Scatter walnuts
  over salad along with cheese. Garnish with chervil and dust lightly
  with pepper. VINAIGRETTE: In bowl, combine vinegar with salt, then
  whisk in oils. Adjust oil or vinegar to get the balance you like.

    1/4 c  Water; Hot
      1 ts Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Sour Cream
 
  Thoroughly mix ground meats, onion, bread crumbs, 3 T cold water, and
  eggs. Flavor with salt, praprika, mustard, and parsley. Blend
  ingredients thoroughly. Flatten out meat mixture in the shape of a
  square, (8 X 8-inches).  Arrange whole hard-boiled eggs in a row
  along the middle of the meat.  Fold sides of meat pattie over the
  eggs. Shape meat carefully into a loaf resembling a flat bread loaf.
  Occasionally rinse hands in cold water to prevent sticking.  Cube 2
  strips bacon; cook in a Dutch oven about 2 minutes. Carefully add the
  vegetable oil; heat. Place meatloaf in the Dutch oven and cook until
  browned on all sides. Cut remaining bacon strips in half and arrange
  over the top of the meatloaf. Place uncovered Dutch oven in a
  preheated oven for about 45 minutes. While meat is baking, gradually
  pour hot beef broth over the top of the meatloaf; brush occasionally
  with pan drippings. When done remove meat to a preheated platter and
  keep it warm.  Add 1/4 cup of hot water to pan and scrape all
  particles from the bottom.  Bring to a gentle boil and add cornstarch
  that has been mixed with 1/4 cup water. Cook until bubbly and thick.
  Remove from heat and stir in sour cream.  Reheat to warm.  Season
  with salt and pepper if desired. Serve the sauce separately.

      Title: FALSE FISH
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      7 oz Short Grain Rice
      7 oz Red Lentils
      1    Garlic, Clove, Chopped
      1    Onion, Chopped
      3 tb Herbs of your choice
           Salt
      1    Egg, Beaten
      4 oz Fresh Breadcrumbs
           Oil for Frying
 
  False fish has no more to do with fish than Mock Goose with goose,
  but it is a wondefully inventive dish that resembles fried fish
  steaks.
  
  Method: Boil the rice until cooked - about 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
  cook the lentils, garlic and onion together in as little water as
  possible. As soon as the rice and lentils are just cooked, drain
  them, then stir them together adding the herbs and salt. Press the
  mixture into a 2 pint (1.2 litre) pudding basin. Fit a Saucer into
  the basin on top of the mixture, weight it down - a couple of tins
  will do nicely - and leave it overnight. The following day, remove
  the mixture and cut into slices. Coat the slices with egg, then
  breadcrumbs and fry until golden. Serve with fresh vegetables and
  parsley sauce.

MMMMM------------------------SIMPLE GRAVY-----------------------------
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Whole wheat pastry flour
      2 ts Nutritional yeast (opt)
      1 tb Instant gravy mix OR
      1    Vegetable bouillon cube
  2 1/2 c  Reserved potato water
 
   1.  Peel and quarter potatoes. Place ina  medium or large pot with
  water to cover. Add garlic, celery, parsley, peppercorns, onion, and
  bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat for
  15 to 20 minutes or until very tender.
  
   2.  While potatoes are cooking, prepare filling. Heat 1 T oil,
  onion, and garlic in a large skillet. Saute for 1 minute over medium
  heat, then add mushrooms and saute for 2 minutes. Crumble tofu in
  chunks into skillet and saute briefly, mixing well. Stir in barbecue
  sauce, yeast, gravy mix, thyme, paprika, and tamari. Mix well and
  saute, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes over medium heat. Preheat
  oven to 400.
  
   3.  Transfer potatoes from water to a large bowl, reserving potato
  stock. Add miso, oil, and 3/4 to 1 cup potato stock to potatoes, in
  1/4- to 1/3-cup increments, mashing as you add the stock. Add only
  enough water to moisten potatoes adequately. Do not overmoisten.
  
   4.  Add corn and spinach to filling and mix well. Pour filling into
  an oiled, shallow ovenproof casserole.
   Pat down with back of a large spoon. Spread potato crust evenly over
  filling, smoothing top with a spoon or spatula. Dust evenly with
  paprika. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until crust is golden.
  
   5.  While casserole bakes, prepare gravy. Heat oil in a large
  skillet. Add flour and yeast, and stir with a whisk over medium heat
  to form a paste. Slowly stir in 2 1/2 cups of reserved potato water,
  whisking as you stir to allow gravy to thicken. Stir in instant gravy
  mix and continue whisking until gravy is thick and smooth; add
  additional potato water, if necessary.
  
   6. Serve casserole with crust on the bottom and filling on top. Spoon
  gravy over top.

 Categories: Pets
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
      1 c  Vegetable shortening; *
      1 ts Unsalted butter; *
    1/4 c  Egg whites
    1/4 c  Honey
           Food coloring; optional
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 c  Cheddar cheese; fine grate**
           Sesame seeds; optional
 
  * For even crunchier cookies, use only 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2
  teaspoon unsalted butter
  
  ** The Famous Fido commercial baker uses Cheddar cheese powder
  
  1. In a large bowl, beat shortening and butter with an electric mixer
  at high speed until creamy. Add egg whites and honey; beat until
  smooth. Beat in food coloring, if desired.
  
  2. Combine flour, garlic powder and cheese. Beat into shortening
  mixture. Stir in more food coloring if you like.
  
  3. Gather dough into a ball. Divide it in half, then in fourths and
  so on until you have 36 small pieces. Flour your hands and roll the
  pieces into balls. (Or, use a pastry bag to shape the cookies.) Place
  them on an ungreased cookie sheet, then use a floured fork to gently
  flatten them in a crisscross design. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, if
  desired.
  
  4. Bake in a preheated 325'F oven until firm, about 10 minutes. (To
  make the cookies crunchier, after baking we turned off the heat and
  left them in the oven about 5 minutes, first running a spatula under
  each one so they wouldn't stick to the pan.)

      3 c  Flour
      1 c  Desiccated coconut
      6    Curry leaves *
      2 tb Crushed dried shrimp
    1/2    Onion, chopped
     10    Green chilies, chopped
      1 c  Warm water (approx., just
           -enough to moisten the
           -dough)
           Vegetable oil

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Green onions or leeks,
           -finely chopped
      1 ts Crushed, dried red chilies
    1/2 c  Cabbage, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Kale, finely chopped
           A few curry leaves*
           -(optional)
           Salt
           Black pepper
           Vegetable oil for frying
 
  Combine the ingredients, mix well, and add enough warm water to make
  a soft dough.  Knead it until it forms a ball and does not stick to
  the sides of the bowl. Shape it into balls about 2 inches in
  diameter. Then flatten each ball on a greased plate or cutting
  surface, spreading it until it is as thin or thick as desired. Fill
  with the following:
  
  Filling: In a bowl, combine the green onions or leeks, red chilies,
  cabbage, kale, and curry leaves.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Heat
  the oil in a skillet, and saute the vegetables and spices until
  golden. Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling on each rotti, fold
  the rotti in half, and pinch the edges together to form a packet
  enclosing the vegetables. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet, and
  fry each rotti until the filling is warmed through.
  
  *Curry leaves - edible gray-green leaves that resemble bay leaf, used
  in flavoring sambols and fish, vegetable, or meat curries. The Sri
  Lankans use curry leaves fresh, but they can be used dried if fresh
  leaves are not available.  The Sinhalese term for the plant is
  'karapincha', and if you can find them fresh, they add great depth
  and flavor to a dish. They are not removed before serving, and they
  are edible. There is no substitute for curry leaves.

 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Quick-cooking oats
    3/4 c  Skim milk
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/4 c  Plus 2*tablespoons brown

    1/4 ts Baking soda
      2 tb Plus*1*1/2*teaspoons Prune
           Puree
      2    Egg whites
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Finely chopped fresh pears
           (about 1*1/2*medium)
    1/3 c  Coarsely chopped fresh or
           Frozen cranberries
    1/3 c  Golden raisins

MMMMM------------------------PRUNE PUREE-----------------------------
      3 oz Prunes (about*1/2*cup)
      1 c  Water or fruit juice
 
  use blender or food processor to puree prunes. use immediately or
  store in airtight container in fridge.
  
  Combine the oats and skim milk, stir to mix well, and set aside for at
  least 5 minutes.
  
  Combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and baking soda, and
  stir to mix well.  Add the oat milk mixture and the Prune Puree, egg
  whites, vanilla extract, and pears, and stir just until the dry
  ingredients are moistened.  Fold in the cranberries and raisins.
  
  Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray, and fill 3/4 full with
  the batter.  Bake at 350F for 15 to 17 minutes, or just until a wooden
  toothpick inserted in the center of the muffin comes out clean.
  
  Remove the muffin tin from the oven, and allow it to sit for 5 minutes
  before removing the muffins.  Serve warm or at room temp.
  
  My experience: I substituted frozen and thawed mixed berries for the
  cranberries. Making extra prune puree as stated above is confusing --
  next time I'll just throw some prunes (probably 2-3) and juice in the
  blender.
  
  The cook time may be low -- mine took 20 - 25 minutes.

      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      5 lb Fresh ham
      8    Scallions
      3 tb Peanut oil
      8 sl Fresh ginger
      4    Garlic cloves
           - peeled and crushed

MMMMM----------------------BRAISING LIQUID---------------------------
      5 c  Hot water
      1 c  Dark soy sauce
      1 c  Rice wine or dry sherry
      3 tb Roasted Sichuan peppercorns
           -(whole)
      6 tb Rock or ordinary sugar
      4    Star anise
      2    Cinnamon sticks or bark
      2 ts Five-spice powder
      1 ts Salt
 
  DRY THE HAM THOROUGHLY with paper towels. Cut the scallions into
  3-inch segments. Choose a heavy casserole or pot, large enough to
  hold the ham comfortably. Heat the pot and then add the oil, ginger,
  garlic and scallions, and stir-fry in the pot for 2 minutes. Push the
  aromatics to the side and brown the ham on each side until it has
  some color, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour off the oil. Add all the braising
  liquid ingredients to the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn
  the heat down to a simmer, cover tightly and cook for about 4 1/2
  hours, turning the ham from time to time. When the ham is tender,
  remove it gently with a large spatula. The meat should be literally
  falling apart. Place it on a serving platter. Strain the sauce, skim
  off any surface fat, and reduce the liquid until it is slightly
  thick. Pour this over the ham and serve.

    1/2 c  Chopped nuts
           Grease for the pan
 
  the COmplete Passover Cookbook, by Frances AvRutick.
   In a small bowl, cover the farfel with cold water, drain
  immediately. The farfel should be moist but not soggy. In a large
  mixiing bowl, beat the eggs with the oil or margarine.Add the farfel.
  Stir well. Add the apple or banana and the nuts. Gently mix. Pour the
  into greased 8" square pan. Bake in a 350 oven until brown, 30-40
  minutes. Serves 6-8.
  
  This is the only recipe I have for this as it is not something I
  make. I do think that there were other farfel kugel recipes earlier.
  I would backdate and see if there are any still alive. Or post a note

  This Italian dish is also popular in Argentina.  They call it faina'
  and it is sometimes prepared with onion slices as a topping. A plain
  faina' slice is often used to top a pizza slice, sandwich-style.
  
  Pour the water into a large heavy pan, then gradually stir in the
  flour. Add salt to taste.  Cook over gentle heat for 1 hour, stirring
  frequently and skimming the surface with a slotted spoon
  occasionally; the mixture should be smooth and quite thick.
  
  Pour the mixture into an oiled roasting pan (preferably a pizza pan)
  and level the surface. Sprinkle the oil over the surface, and arrange
  the onion rings on top, if used.
  
  Bake in a moderately hot oven (400 F / 200 C) for 30 minutes until
  golden brown.  Sprinkle liberally with pepper and serve immediately.

      Title: FARMER'S CHEESE
 Categories: Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 qt Buttermilk; low-fat
           Water
           Cheesecloth strainer
 
  Place the five quarts of buttermilk in a non corrosive pan; i.e.
  enamel or stainless steel.  Pour water at least half way up the sides
  of the containers (use cardboard ones; not glass bottles). Bring to a
  boil and let it go for 20 minutes.  Turn of and wait until the water
  is tepid. hang the cheesecloth strainer over the sink or over a large
  pot. You will need help here. Pour each quart of 'cooked' buttermilk
  into the strainer and let it hang at least 12 hours.  What you will
  have left in the bag is a very dry cheese...similar to Farmer's
  cheese.  Now my Stepmom sometimes adds a bit of sugar to the cheese.
  If you put it in the FP and zap it with a some milk you have a creamy
  spread; similar to cream cheese. We use this in Blintzas and in place
  of ricotta in some recipes.
   It would be wonderful if you need Farmer's cheese and can't get it.

  be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen as long as 3
  months. Reheat gently, adjusting water and seasoning as needed.

      Title: FARMERS CABBAGE WITH SMOKED SAUSAGE  (BOERENK
 Categories: Pork, German, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Good sized potatoes
      1 bn Of kale (to fill a 2 qt.
           -pot)
      1 lb Smoked sausage
      3 tb Butter or margarine
           Salt and pepper
 
  Peel, cook, and mash potatoes.  At the same time, chop kale finely,
  cook untill tender. Dice and cook sausage. Put kale into a blender
  with enough of the cooking water to make a thick slurry. When done,
  add to the mashed potatoes. Add cooked sausage.  Add butter. Salt and
  pepper to taste. Mix well and serve piping hot. For a more festive
  apprearance, put into a cassarole dish, garnish with slices of Oude
  Gouda (Old Gouda) or a medium cheddar and sprinkle with paprika.
  Place in medium oven until cheese melts and begins to brown. Then
  serve or take to your pitch-in.
  
  Don't sell the kohl crops short.  Try collards and savoy. They are
  still doing quite well in the garden despite 15 F. temperatures
  lately. Savoy is a joy to eat at Yule. The frost seems to sweeten and
  intensify the flavor. Our annual homemade sauerkraut is making its
  presence known by the merry burbling of the water-seal crocks in the
  utility room. This is the best time of the year to make kraut.  It is
  cool and the fermentation takes a longer time, leaving the salted
  sour cabbage as crisp as the bright windy day in October it was put
  up.
  
  We are lucky to have antique apple trees.  Three bushels of mixed
  russets are slumbering in the garage and will last until spring. Fie
  on the Granny Smiths and Red Delicious! A Golden Russet or Ashmeads
  Kernel, peeled and sliced, served with a wedge of sharp cheddar at
  your side on a winter evening while reading a good book is one of
  lifes great luxuries.
  
  Rereading this post makes me hungry.  No I'm not going to crack open a
  fruit cake!  They are not ready for another month. Besides, my
  nocturnal rustlings are not always appreciated around here, except
  for the ever present cats who always look for a handout.  The coffee
  is ready though and I think I remember where Frances stashed some
  homemade cookies.

      Title: FARSRULADER (STUFFED VEAL ROULADES)
 Categories: Sweden, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 16 Roulades
 
      2 c  Cold water
      1 md Potato; peeled, quartered
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Onions; finely chopped
      1 lb Veal; finely ground
      3 tb Bread crumbs; fine dry
    1/3 c  Cream; heavy
      2 tb Water
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts White pepper
      1    Egg
      2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Leeks; white only, sliced
           -paper thin
      8 tb Butter (1 stick)
    1/4 c  Cream; heavy
 
  In a 1 to 1 1/2 quart saucepan, bring the cold water to a boil. Add
  the quartered potato and boil 10 to 15 minutes or until tender. Drain
  and mash with a fork. In a small frying pan, melt 2 tb butter. When
  the foam subsides, add the onions and cook 7 or 8 minutes stirring
  frequently until they are soft and transparent but not brown. Scrape
  the onions into a large mixing bowl and add the mashed potato, ground
  veal, bread crumbs, cream, water, salt, pepper, egg, parsley and
  cornstarch. Mix well then refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Brush a
  large wooden pastry board (or another hard, smooth surface) with
  water and pat or roll out the mixture into a 16"x16" square about
  1/8" thick. Your hands or the rolling pin should be moistened with
  water to prevent the meat mixture from sticking. With a pastry wheel
  or small, sharp knife, cut the rectangle of meat into 16 squares of
  4"x4" each. Put a thin layer of leek slices (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)
  on each square. With the aid of a knife, or better still, an icing
  spatula, roll up each square, jelly-roll fashion. Ideally they should
  now be chilled but may, if necessary, be cooked immediately. Heat 2
  tb. butter in a heavy skillet. When the foam subsides, add the
  roulades, 4 at a time, turning them gently with a spatula so that
  they brown on all sides. When they are a rich brown, set them aside
  on a heated platter in a 200øF oven. Repeat the process, adding 2 tb
  fresh butter for every 4 roulades. Pour 1/4 cup heavy cream into the
  empty pan and boil it rapidly for 3 to 5 minutes, until it thickens,
  meanwhile scraping up the browned bits in the pan with a rubber
  spatula or wooden spoon. Taste for seasoning adding salt as needed
  and pour over roulades. If you must, cover the platter with foil and
  keep warm in a 200øF oven for not more than 15 minutes.

      Title: FAST FOOD 4 (RICE & VEGETABLES) (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Dec., Quick
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Instant rice
      1 x  Bouillon
      1 x  Italian seasoning
      1 x  Onion
      1 cn Crushed tomatoes
      1    Box thawed frozen spinach
 
  In large pot, cook up 2 cups of (real or instant) rice. When it's
  almost done, stir in a spoon or two of bouillion granules, and/or
  some italian seasoning, onion, black pepper, whatever. Add a large
  can of crushed tomatoes.  Add a box of thawed frozen spinach.
  
  And a few hints:
  
  When you cook, make a big pot of whatever it is you're making. It
  won't add very much extra work, and you can freeze the leftovers, or
  just munch on them for a few days.
  
  Keep shortcut foods like canned beans, quick-cooking noodles (not
  ramen bricks, they have a lot of fat), instant rice, canned tomato
  puree, dehydrated onions, quick-cook oatmeal, frozen veggies, etc.
  around. They aren't as good or as nutritious as the 'real thing', and
  they cost more, but they come in very handy when you don't have
  time...

 Categories: Desserts, American
      Yield: 1 Lb
 
      2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Peanut butter
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      3 tb Cocoa (optional)
 
  Mix sugar, 1/2 cup water, and optional cocoa in a saucepan, and boil
  rapidly for exactly one minute. Pour over peanut butter and vanilla
  in a bowl, and beat until thick. Pour into buttered pan and allow to
  cool. Cut into squares. This recipe starts out as peanut-butter
  fudge, but with the addition of powdered cocoa, can apparently been
  engineered to be chocolate. I've not tried the cholocate variation,
  but the basic pb is so good and so easy that its certainly worth the
  try...

      Title: FAT FREE FRIES
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Whole Idaho Baking Potatos
           Scrubbed clean, skin on
        x  Non Stick Spray
        x  Onion Powder
        x  Garlic Powder
        x  Paprika
 
  Spray cookie sheet with Non stick spray (I prefer the airbake kind,
  the fries dont burn as easily).  Slice potatos into french fry shapes
  lengthwise.  Positi on the fries on the cookie sheet leaving minimal
  space in between each. Spray a th in layer of Non stick spray over
  the top of the fries and sprinkle with onion powd er garlic powder &
  Paprika. Broil for 5-7 minutes until crusty on the outside. Remove
  from oven and turn the fries over.  Broil on second side for an
  addition al 5-7 minutes. If the fries seem underdone, bake for
  another 10 min or so at 350 degress. Remove from oven. Place on
  serving platter & cover with a (paper ) towel or plate for 5-10 min
  (this helps the fries to soften on the inside). Serve.
  
  Another tip:  To get really great saute'd onions saute them with
  watered down apple juice - no fat but good taste.

      Title: FAT FREE GRILLING A LA PAUL PRUDHOMME
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Vegetables
      1 ea Balsamic vinegar
      1 ea Onions
      1 ea Garlic
      1 ea Tamari sauce
      1 ea Cajun spices
      1 ea Tomato sauce
      1 ea Broth
      1 ea Corn starch
 
  I saw Paul Prudhomme, the Cajun cook, on a "Home" show this weekend.
  He said the secret to cooking without fat is to have the non-stick
  pan *HOT* when you put the vegetables in to start cooking. He
  recommended the pan be at 350 degrees and he had a special flat,
  circular thermometer that he lays in the pan to check the temperature.
  
  Has anyone used one of these thermometers??? How did it work?
  
  Paul's technique for cooking was also very interesting. He started by
  browning sliced peppers (yellow and red) and carrots in the hot pan.
  He later added moreof the same vegetables so that they would be less
  cooked and have a different flavor. He said this added to the
  complexity of flavors in the dish. He also added spices (Cajun of
  course) at each level of cooking.
  
  After he cooked the vegetables, he added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar
  and 1/4 cup of tamari and cooked that down. He later added broth,
  tomato sauce and corn starch... and more spices. I think he also put
  in onions and garlic at the same time as the vinegar and tamari.

    1/2 c  Whole unblanched almonds
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose white flour
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs
      2 lg Egg whites
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 tb Unsweetened coco powder
      2 ts Instant coffee
      1 oz Unsweet. chocolate - melted
    1/2 ts Pure almond extract
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and
  bake for 12 to 14 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Set aside.
  
  Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk
  together eggs, egg whites and vanilla, and add to the dry
  ingredients. Mix just until smooth. In a small bowl, combine cocoa,
  instant coffee and 4 tsp. water. Divide the dough in half. To one
  half, add the cocoa mixture and melted chocolate. Mix just until
  incorporated. To the other half, stir in almond extract and almonds.
  
  Place half of the almond dough on a well-floured work surface. Pat
  into a 4x8 inch rectangle. Top with half of chocolate dough. Roll up
  into a log b, then roll back and forth to form a 14 inch log, 1 1/2
  inches thick. Repeat with the remaining doughs. Place the logs on a
  prepared baking sheet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until firm to
  the touch. Transfer the logs to a rack to cool. Reduce the oven
  temperature to 300 degrees F.
  
  Cut the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch slices. Stand the slices
  upright on the baking sheet and bake for 40 more minutes. Let cool
  before storing in an air tight container.
  
  * This makes 2 loaves. For easy doubling of this recipe, make 2
  recipes, one all almond and one all chocolate.
  
  * Before putting chocolate dough on top of almond dough, brush a
  little water between them. Also, an egg white whisked with a little
  water brushed on logs before baking gives them a nice look.

      Title: FAT RASCAL COOKIES
 Categories: Biscuits
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
    3/8 ts Baking powder
      1 tb Sugar, dark brown
      4 oz Butter
    1/2 c  Currants
      1 tb Milk
      2 tb -Water
           -Sugar for dusting on top
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Sift the flour and the baking powder.
  Add a pinch of salt, mix in the brown sugar and rub in the butter.
  Add the currants, milk and just enough water to make a soft dough.
  Roll out the dough on a well-floured surface to approximately 1/2
  inch thickness and using a glass, cut into 2 inch rounds. Dust each
  circle with a little sugar and place on a well greased baking sheet.
  Bake for 20 minutes or until the rascals begin to turn golden. cool
  on a rack before serving.
  
  Note by A. MacLellan--This is an English recipe and because of the
  difference in flour. I found it necessary to increase the amount of
  liquid and reduce the heat to 375 degrees. I used quite a bit of
  liquid and make a drop cookie. They take very much like the currant
  biscuits that you can buy from Marks and Spencer at a high price.

  1 1/4 c  Hot water
 
  Tucsonan R.D. Skinner has recently put out a new cookbook, "R.D.
  Skinner's Best in Fat-Free Cooking." The book is not yet available in
  major book stores, but can be ordered by calling (602) 797-7832.
  Here's a sample from the book.
  
  In large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well. Add
  fat-free mayonnaise and use pastry blender (or fork) and blend until
  flour mixture appears to be coarse throughout.
  
  Add hot water and stir well. Knead in extra flour. Cover and allow to
  stand for 10 minutes.
  
  Set iron griddle over medium to medium-high heat. Tear off a piece of
  dough, roll into a ball (approximately 2 1/2").
  
  On well-floured board, roll dough out into a circular flat form as
  thin as possible (less than 1/8" thickness) approximately 6" in
  diameter. Add more flour if dough is sticky. Place tortilla on heated
  griddle and allow it to bubble slightly. heat for approximately 1-2
  minutes.
  
  Flip tortilla and brown other side approximately 1 minute longer. If
  tortilla has browned in variable spots and does not have a dough-like
  texture, then it is done.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Matza Meal
    1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Powdered instant broth
           (chicken or veggie)

  Stir the dry ingredients together
  
  Stir egg whites, club soda, and parsley slightly with a fork and pour
  	over the dry ingredients.  Mix well and refrigerate at least one
  hour.
  
  Form into 8 balls (1 1/2 inch diameter) and drop into a large pot of
  boiling slated water or broth.
  
  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Do not remove
  the lid during the cooking period. Remove matza balls with a slotted

  [Note:  I have not tried this recipe.  In general, though, matza
  balls keep well in the fridge, just warm them up before serving in
  soup.]

  It's the starch in the flour that does the thickening, not the butter.
  Flour needs to be cooked to get rid of the raw taste and the butterfat
  makes this easy to do without burning the flour. However, it is
  possible to brown flour without fat, it just takes more care.
  Furthermore, browned flour is relatively shelf stable, so you can
  make a big batch and use it over a month or two. Other starches
  (cornstarch, potato starch, arrowroot, etc) can be used as thickening
  agents as well. They vary in their strength, taste, and temperature
  sensativity. See McGee's _On Food and Cooking_ for comparison info.
  
  For examples of using browned flour as a substitute for a traditional
  roux, see Enola Prudhomme's _Low-Calorie Cajun Cooking_ and Paul
  
  Prudhome's _Fork In the Road_. (which also contain instructions for
  browning flour). Here's instructions for browning flour from the
  archives:
  
  Date:    Thu, 21 Oct 93 13:23:44 PDT From: Michelle Dick <artemis>
  
  From The Joy of Cooking:
  
  BROWNED FLOUR
  
  A variant used in gravies to enhance color and flavor [and as we now
  know, to do fatfree cajun cooking]. The slow but inexpensive
  
  procedure by which it is made is worth trying.  The flour, when ready,
  should smell nutty and baked. Place:
  
        1    cup flour
  
  in a dry heavy skillet.  Stir constantly over very low direct heat,
  scraping the flour from the sides and bottom of the pan. Or, heat the
  flour in a very slow oven, 200 deg F to 250 deg F, in a very heavy
  pan. Shake the pan periodically so the flour browns evenly. Do not
  let it get too dark or, as with brown roux, it will become bitter and
  lose its thickening power altogether.  Even properly browned flour
  has only about half the thickening power of all-purpose flour. It may
  be stored in a tightly covered jar in a cool place.

      Title: FATFREE BAKING POWDER BISCUITS
 Categories: Digest, Oct., Lacto
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour*
      2 tb Baking powder
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Apple sauce
    1/2    To 2/3 cup
           Cold low-fat buttermilk,
           Skim milk or milk
           Substitute
 
  In a larger bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.
  Sprinkle the applesauce over the flour, and cut in with a pastry
  blender until it is in bits the size of split peas. The texture
  should be somewhat course.
  
  Sprinkle 1/2 cup cold milk over the flour and applesauce, and stir it
  in quickly with a fork. Add only as much of the milk as is necessary
  to make the dough hold together.
  
  Gather the dough up into a ball, working it together with your hands
  very briefly, and then roll it out 1/2 inch thick on a floured board.
  Cut out small rounds (about 2 1/2" to 3" in diameter) and place them
  on a cookie sheet spritzed with Pam. If you aren't going to put them
  in the oven immediately, chill them in the refrigerator until ready
  to bake.
  
  Bake the biscuits in a preheated oven at 450 degrees for 10 to 12
  minutes, or until puffed and lightly browned on top.
  
  Makes about 15 - 20 biscuits.
  
  * preferably, use white pastry flour. All-purpose flour or whole-wheat
  pastry flour can be used, but the biscuits will be denser and less
  fluffy.
  
  Gravy recipe follows.

      Title: FATFREE CARAMEL CORN
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Light brown sugar
    3/4 c  Water
    1/2 ts Vinegar
 
  Combine the above in a 2-qt. saucepan, bring to boil (stirring to
  dissolve sugar completely).  Continue boiling and stirring until
  syrup thickens and reaches the "hard-crack" stage -- consult the
  candy-making section of any comprehensive cookbook for description
  and candy-thermometer temperature. My method of determining readiness
  is when the syrup "makes threads" when dropped off the tip of a spoon
  OR when a drop allowed to fall into a cup of cool tap water forms a
  ball instantly. It takes practice -- cook too long and the coating
  will be granular; cook not long enough and it'll be sticky. When the
  syrup reaches the desired stage, take it off the burner, IMMEDIATELY
  stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (the soda
  interacts with the vinegar's acidity and makes the syrup light and
  sort of foamy).  Pour gradually over popped corn while stirring with
  a long-handled spoon to distribute the coating (or have someone else
  do the stirring or pouring).  This stuff is VERY HOT and will stick
  to you and inflict deep burns so be careful! Homemade caramel corn is
  much superior to anything you can buy in a package. Or at KarmelKorn,
  for that matter. Once you know how to do it, you can play around with
  other flavorings, like Cinnamon Oil (use sparingly!) or other
  extracts.

      Title: FATFREE CHEESE (REFERENCE)
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  Well, there is Sap Sago cheese (aka Schbzieger cheese). It's a hard
  herbed cheese from Switzerland made from skimmed milk. It's sold in
  small foil covered cones.  This cheese has been around a long time --
  long before the push for fatfree foods. Best use is to grate it,
  toast it slightly and use as you would parmesian. I've seen this at
  gourmet shops mostly, I'd bet it is available worldwide.
  
  Two American cheeses worth noting are: Cabot 75% fat reduced cheddar
  (with simplesse).  Best tasting low fat (2 grams fat per ounce)
  cheddar I've found.  Also a new entrant: Vermont Farms Skinny
  cheese-- a semi-hard farmers cheese made from skimmed milk (1.5 grams
  fat per ounce. Very costly at $11/lb, but only cheese I would eat
  plain. Note that although these have some fat, they are close to the
  limit on how low a "pure" skimmed milk cheese can be (skim milk has
  some fat -- condense the milk to cheese and the fat becomes more
  concentrated).
  
  There are lots and lots of fake fatfree cheeses in the US. IMHO, most
  are terrible (but passable in combination dishes, pizzas, veggie
  melts and the like).  Mozarella types seem most palatable ("cheddars"
  are usually the mozarella-type + orange food coloring).

      2 c  Grape Nuts
    1/2 c  Apple juice concentrate
 
  mix together and press into the pie pan.  Bake 10 minutes at 350
  degrees and cool if you'll add a cool filling. For pumpkin pie, I
  just add the filling and bake it all at once.
  
  I run the Grape Nuts through the food processor first, and I find a
  half recipe is sufficient if you don't need the crust to go too far
  up the side of the pan.

      Title: FATFREE RICE KRISPIE TREATS
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 c  Rice Krispies Cereal
           (nothing else works as well,
           IMO)
      1    10 oz. bag miniature
           Marshmallows
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
 
  Lightly spray a 9" x 13" pan with PAM. Measure out cereal. Pour corn
  syrup into a large pot, placed on medium heat. When the syrup has
  warmed up a bit, add the marshmallows. Continue to heat, stirring
  frequently, until the marshmallows are melted and smooth. Add cereal,
  stirring with a large spoon until the cereal is uniformly coated.
  Turn out into prepared pan. Cover cereal mixture with waxed paper,
  and using hands, spread and press the cereal evenly in the pan,
  compressing firmly. Allow the treats to cool for 5 minutes or so
  before removing the waxed paper. After the pan has cooled, cut into
  squares using a sharp knife dipped in hot water.
  
  Yield: about 18 2" x 3" squares.
  
  NOTE: THESE ARE VERY STICKY!  You'll want to press them down quickly,
  because they harden really fast! We put them in the freezer for a
  while to make cutting them easier and it also made them easier to
  handle in general.

      Title: FATFREE WHITE SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Soy or rice milk
      1 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 tb Parsley Patch seasoning
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
      2 tb Cornstarch
 
  Heat 1 1/2 cups soy or rice milk, add soy sauce and seasonings. Mix
  the cornstarch with the remaining milk and add to the pot, stirring
  constantly. It should thicken quickly. Cook on low heat about few
  minutes, stirring. It holds well if the rest of dinner isn't quite
  ready.
  
  The McDougall recipe puts the cornstarch in 1/4 cup water, but for a
  gravy you don't need the extra liquid.

      Title: FATS DESCRIBED
 Categories: Digest, Text file
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Text file
 
  Glycerides: which include triglycerides (most common type of fat we
  think of -- all oils: olive, corn, etc, are triglycerides) and mono
  and di glycerides.
  
  Phosopholipids: very similar to triglycerides, except that one of the
  three glycerides (fatty acids) is replaced with a phosphate compond.
  Lecithin is a phospholipid (and hence, a fat). BTW, phospholipids are
  not essential in the diet since the body can manufacture its own.
  
  Sterols: these are lipids that are ring-shaped.  The most familiar
  one is cholesterol.
  
  Note that mono and di-glycerides and phospholipids share the basic
  structure of the triglycerides but with one or more of the fatty acids
  replaced with something that is hydrophilic (or water soluble). Thus,
  these fats function primarily as emulsifiers in food products
  (bridging fat and water).

      Title: FATTY FISH BENEFITS~ TEXT FILE
 Categories: Instruction
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------BENEFITS OF FATTY FISH------------------------
 
  In an article in the December journal of the American Dietetic
  Association, editor Elaine R. Morgan reports on the recommendation to
  have two servings weekly of fatty fish.
  
  The fat in fish contains omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce the risk of
  heart disease, kidney-related diseases and skin disorders.
  
  The report further states that pregnant women and children benefit
  from omega-3 fatty acids in that they are important for the
  development of brain and nerve cells, including the eyes.
  
  The recommendation does not mean that you should add more fat to the
  diet but rather that you should substitute another source of protein
  in the diet with fish twice a week to reduce the amount of saturated
  fat in the diet. Fish contains highly unsaturated fat.
  
  The following list was compiled by the National Fisheries Institute.
  It is a listing of fish and shellfish according to omega-3 content in
  a 3 1/2 ounce serving.
  
  Most (More than 1.0 gram) Anchovy, Atlantic bluefish, Atlantic
  salmon, coho salmon, herring, mackerel, pilchards, pink salmon,
  sablefish, sardines, sockeye salmon, spiny dogfish, and whitefish.
  
  Moderate (0.5 to 0.9 gram) chum, salmon, pompano, rainbow trout,
  shark, smelt, spot, striped bass, swordfish, Pacific oysters, and
  squid.
  
  Least (less than 0.5 gram) carp, channel catfish, cod, flounder,
  grouper, haddock, Pacific halibut, mahi mahi, ocean perch, orange
  roughy, pike, pollock, rockfish, sea bass, snapper, whiting, clams,
  crab, crayfish, Eastern oysters, lobsters, mussels, scallops and
  shrimp.

      Title: FAUX-FRESH TOMATO SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Low-cal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           From: Gaye Levy
      1    Onion; medium, chopped
      1    Carrot; large, chopped
      4 c  Chicken broth; reg strength
      1 cn Tomato puree; 15 oz.
      3 tb Basil leaves; dried
    3/4 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts White pepper
      2 ts Vegetable oil; optional
 
  Spray the bottom of a 3 to 4 quart pan with PAM, or optionally, coat
  with oil. Add the onion and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally,
  until both the onion and the carrot are sweet tasting and tender when
  pierced. This will take about 30 minutes.  Stir broth, tomato
  puree, basil sugar and pepper into pan. Bring to a boil on high heat.
  Cover and simmer to blend flavors, about 15 minutes.  With a
  slotted spoon, scoop vegetables and a little of the broth into a food
  processor or blender. Whirl until smoothly pureed. Pour vegetable
  mixture back into the pan; heat until steaming. Ladle into bowls and
  enjoy.   Notes from Gaye: This recipe is adapted from Sunset
  Magazine, circa 1987. What could be more filling (and warming) this
  time of year than a large bowl of soup and some fresh bread? For the
  bread, try the Italian Bread which is as lo-cal as bread can go...and
  go easy on the butter or margarine.

      Title: FAVA BEAN & SALT COD SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Ounces salt cod
      2    To 2 1/2 pounds young fava
           -beans, shelled, peeled
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      2 tb Chopped fresh thyme or
           -winter savory
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
      4    Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
           -seeded and chopped (about
           -1 cup)
 
  Here, fava beans are paired with salt cod in a rich and filling
  salad. To complement the rustic flavors of this dish, serve with
  toasted garlic-rubbed baguette slices and a soft goat cheese.
  
  Soak the salt cod overnight in a large bowl of cold water. The next
  day, drain the cod, add fresh water and let soak for 2 hours. Drain,
  add fresh water and let soak 2 hours longer. The amount of soaking
  time needed to leach the salt from the fish will vary.
  
  Bring 4 cups of water to a shimmering simmer in skillet just large
  enough to hold the fish.  Add the fish and poach until barely cooked
  through (it should flake easily), about 5 minutes. Do not boil.
  Remove fish and drain well, then flake it.
  
  Cook the favas in 4 cups boiling water until just tender, about 10 to
  15 minutes.  Drain.
  
  Combine the olive oil, thyme or savory, pepper and salt (if desired).
  Toss with the favas.
  
  Arrange equal portions of the dressed beans, flaked fish and chopped
  tomatoes on individual salad plates.
  
  Serves 4.

      2 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Lemon, juiced

MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
      1 pn Paprika
 
  Drain the dried beans and place in large saucepan with cold water to
  cover. Bring slowly to a boil, drain and rinse. Rinse out the
  saucepan, return the beans to the pan, and add cold water to cover by
  3 inches. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and gently simmer
  25 to 30 minutes, or until soft. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the
  cooking liquid. Remove the fava bean skins with your fingers and
  spread the beans between layers of paper towels to dry. Heat 2
  tablespoons of the olive oil in a large heavy skillet. Saute the
  onion, garlic, carrot, celery, and bay leaf over medium-low heat for
  15 to 20 minutes, or until dark golden brown, stirring occasionally
  with a wooden spoon. Transfer to a food processor or blender
  container and add the bread. With the machine running, add about two
  thirds of the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and
  process until thick and smooth. Add a few tablespoons of water if the
  puree seems too thick, and add salt, pepper, olive oil, and/or lemon
  juice to taste. Serve on a platter, sprinkled with the remaining
  parsley and olive oil and the paprika. To make the traditional way:
  Pound the cooked vegetable-bean mixture and the bread in a large
  wooden mortar for 5 minutes. Slowly add about two thirds of the lemon
  juice and then 3/4 cup of the olive oil. Pound for 5 minutes longer,
  and add salt, pepper, olive oil, and/or lemon juice to taste.

      Title: FAVORITE EGG NOG
 Categories: Beverages, Eggs, Alcohol
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
     24    Eggs, separated
      2 c  Sugar
      1 qt Bourbon
      2 c  Brandy
      1 qt Heavy cream
      2 qt Milk
      1 qt Vanilla ice cream
           Nutmeg
 
  Beat egg yolks and sugar until thick. Add Bourbon and Brandy and stir
  thoroughly. (The liquor "cooks" the eggs.) Add cream and milk and
  continue whipping. Break up the ice cream and add. Beat egg whites
  until stiff and fold in. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before
  serving. Sprinkle lightly with nutmeg. NOTE1: This is fairly potent
  and deceptively smooth, so you might wish to
         cut back on the Bourbon and Brandy a little. NOTE2: If you can
  get it where you are, then the only ice cream to use in
         this recipe is on of the following BLUE BELL CREAMERY flavors -
         Natural Vanilla Bean, Homemade Vanilla, or French Vanilla.
  NOTE3: Any good bourbon or sour mash will do, but Old Forester seems
  to add
         a special something to the taste. As for the brandy, don't
  waste the
         VSOP, but don't use that buck-fifty-a-liter varnish remover
  that you
         picked up on that last trip to Tijuana, either.

      Title: FELAFEL
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Cooked chickpeas
      2 c  Soaked 1.5 hours,
           -boiled until very soft
      2    Beaten eggs
      3    Cloves garlic (crushed)
    1/2 c  Finely minced scallions
    1/2 c  Finely minced celery
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
      3 tb Tahini
    1/2 ts Tumeric
      3 tb Flour
    1/4 ts Cayenne
           Dash black pepper
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Mash chickpeas well (make sure they are cooked well enough to be
  mashable). Combine with other ingredients. Chill well. With floured
  hands, make the batter into one-inch-diameter balls. Dust each one
  lightly with flour. Heat a two inch pool of oil in heavy skillet to
  365 degrees. Deep fry felafel until golden brown, serve immediately.
  MY MODIFICATIONS: I usually use 1-2 tsp of cayenne because I like
  them spicy. I usually heat the oil in my wok and then drop the batter
  into the wok by spoonfuls. Don't put too many in the wok at a time or
  the temp. will drop. I peel, seed and slice cucumber, cube tomato and
  grab a bunch of alfalfa sprouts and tuck them into a pita with some
  ranch dressing----- ---

      Title: FENNEL & ONION CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 70 Servings
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Fennel seeds
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Black pepper
      6 tb (1/4 cup plus 2 Tb)
           Shortening
      2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
  1 1/4 c  Minced onion (about one
           Medium onion)
      2 tb Water
 
  "These crackers are flaky and tender, yet crisp. Packed with onions
  and lots of licorice-like fennel flavor, they are almost addictive.
  375~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to 375~F.
  
  Roughly grind the fennel seeds in a food mill or blender or chop them
  by hand with a knife. You may want to do a large batch so that you
  have them on hand for the next time you bake this cracker. If you
  want a stronger fennel flavor, grind a little extra for the tops of
  the crackers.
  
  In the food processor or in a large bowl, combine the flour, fennel,
  salt, and pepper. Cut in the shortening and butter until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal. Stir in the minced onion. Blend in enough of
  the water to form a smooth dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out into a rectangle 1/8 to 1/4 inch
  thick. If desired, sprinkle lightly and evenly with extra ground

  slice it lengthwise, very thinly, leaving the pieces joined together.
  Dress it with most of the remaining vinaigrette and half the herbs,
  and season with salt and pepper. Add the rest of the herbs to the
  mushrooms. Layer the mushrooms, cheese and fennel on each plate and
  spoon the remaining vinaigrette over the top.

      Title: FENNEL WITH CHEESE
 Categories: Vegetables, Main dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lg Round fennel bulb
     15 g  Butter
      2    Shallots
           - peeled and finely chopped
      5 tb Milk (or slightly more)
     25 g  Gorgonzola cheese
           -OR Dolcelatte cheese
     25 g  Fontina or Caciotta cheese
     25 g  Ricotta cheese
 
  A delightful way to eat fennel, where the outer leaves are scoops for
  an unctuous cheesy filling. This is an unusual, rich dish that
  requires merely a green salad and some warm bread to go with it.
  
  Cut the fennel in half down the middle. Cook in boiling water for 10
  minutes or until tender. Drain. Remove the leaves in the centre,
  taking great care not to break them. Leave one complete layer of
  leaves so that a small bowl is formed in which to pour the cheese.
  The leaves you have removed will serve as scoops to eat the cheese.
  Some of the broader ones can be cut in half down the middle. Put
  these to one side.
  
  In a small saucepan melt the butter, and gently fry the shallots until
  soft. Pour on a little of the milk. Crumble in the blue cheese, cut
  the Fontina or Caciotta into small cubes, and put these in the pan
  together with the Ricotta. Stir together, heating gently until
  melted, adding more milk if required, to make a homogeneous, creamy
  consistency. Pour into the fennel 'bowls', and finish under a hot
  grill so that the cheese just begins to brown and bubble.

      Title: FENNEL WITH MUSHROOMS & PROSCIUTTO
 Categories: Side, Vegetable
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
        8    heads fennel -- as noted
    1 1/4 c  chicken broth
      3/4 c  white wine -- slightly
  :          sweet
  :          (such as Johannisberg
  :          Riesling)
        1 lb sliced mushrooms
        2 oz prosciutto -- thinly sliced
  :          and minced
  
  Sauteed mushrooms and crisp prosciutto pieces peek out from tender
  wine-poached fennel bulbs, garnish with fennel fronds. Prep and cook
  time: About 1 hour and 20 minutes (1 hour and 30 minutes if prepared
  ahead and chilled). You can steam the fennel, make the mushroom
  filling, and stuff the bulbs 1 day ahead. *Fennel Note ~ about 6 1/2
  pounds total, 8 fennel, each 3 inches wide at base.
  
  1. Trim off fennel stalks and feathery greens. Reserve feathery
  greens, mincing enough of them to make 1/4 cup. (If making ahead,
  chill 2 tablespoons of the minced greens, as wellas the remaining
  feathery sprigs to use to garnish platter when served.) Reserve
  fennel stalks for use in soups or stocks. Trim any brown spots from
  bulbs; arrange in a single layer in a 5- to 6-quart pan. Pour broth
  andwine over them; cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then
  simmer until fennel is very tender when pierced, 35 to 45 minutes.
  Set aside until cool enough to handle: reserve cooking liquid.
  
  2. While fennel cooks, combine mushrooms, prosciutto, and 2
  tablespoons of the minced fennel greens in an 8- to 10-inch nonstick
  frying pan. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until mushrooms
  exude juice, about 7 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring often, until
  liquid evaporates and mushrooms are browned, about 15 minutes; set
  aside.
  
  3. With a small knife and a sharp-edged spoon, scoop out inner part of
  fennel bulbs so that you have a 1/4-inch-thick shell, keeping shell
  intact. (Reserve scooped-out fennel for soups or other uses, if
  desired.) Spoon mushroom mixture equally into bulbs. Arrange bulbs in
  a baking dish large enough to hold them in a single layer. Spoon
  reserved cooking liquid over them. (If making ahead, cover and chill
  up to 1 day.)
  
  4. Bake stuffed fennel bulbs, covered, in a 375F/190C oven for 15
  minutes; uncover and continue baking until hot, about 10 more minutes
  (20 minutes if made ahead and chilled). Transfer bulbs to a serving
  platter; sprinkle lightly with remaining minced fennel greens, and
  garnish platter with fennel sprigs.

    1/8 ts Fennel seeds
           - crushed under a spoon
           - or in a mortar
      5 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      8 oz Mushrooms, large, firm

           Salt
      3 oz Parmesan Reggiano; shaved
           - into paper-thin slices
 
  POUND THE GARLIC and the salt in a mortar until completely smooth.
  Stir in the lemon juice, lemon peel, fennel seeds and olive oil to
  make a tart, lemony vinaigrette. Thinly slice the mushrooms,
  carefully dress them with a few tablespoons of the vinaigrette, and
  season them with plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Lay a damp
  kitchen towel or a piece of plastic wrap directly over them to keep
  them from browning, and set aside for 1 hour to marinate. Trim the
  fennel bulb and cut it into quarters. Remove most of the core; then
  slice it lengthwise, very thinly, leaving the pieces joined together.
  Dress it with most of the remaining vinaigrette and half the herbs,
  and season with salt and pepper. Add the rest of the herbs to the
  mushrooms. Layer the mushrooms, cheese and fennel on each plate and
  spoon the remaining vinaigrette over the top.

      Title: FERMENTED OR BRINED PICKLES
 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     10    Percent brine solution made
           -by dissolving 1 cup salt in
           -2 quarts
 
  "Pickle making begins with the brine and to make carelessly or to
  maintain carelessly a brine is the reason for most of the soft and
  unfit pickles.
  
  Remember these key points; Use clean stone or glass jars; use only a
  recommended pickling variety of cucumbers; use only canning and
  pickling salt; and do not use hard water. Pickles must be placed in a
  brine and fermented for approximately 6 weeks before the addition of
  the final and last brine."
  
  1.  Wash cucumbers carefully. Use only freshly harvested, slightly
  immature pickling variety. 2. Weigh cucumbers. Put in a clean
  pickling container and cover with a water. (Cucumbers may be added
  during the first day or two of curing process if enough brine is
  added to cover them and if salt is added in definite amounts to
  maintain a 10% brine. 3. Weight cucumbers under brine 4. Store in a
  cool dark place. 5. Next day, add 1 cup salt for each 5 pounds of
  cucumbers. This is necessary to maintain a 10% brine solution. Salt
  must be added on top of plate or clean cloth (and not directly on the
  cucumbers) for even distribution throughout the brine. 6. Remove scum
  when it forms on top of brine. The scum will destroy the acidity of
  the brine and result in spoilage of the product, if left on. 7. At
  the end of the week, and for 4 or 5 succeeding weeks, add 1/4 cup
  salt for each 5 pounds of cucumbers.  Add in the same manner as No.5.
  8. Fermentation resulting in bubble formation should continue about 4
  weeks. Test for bubbles by tapping container on the side with your
  hand. As a second test, cut a cucumber in half; if it is the same
  color throughout and has no noticeable rings or white spots,
  fermentation is complete. 9. Cucumbers may be kept in this 10% brine
  solution--no additional salt is added after they are cured--until
  made into pickles.  The best temperature for brining cucumbers is
  about 70 to 75.

      Title: FERN TIPS VINAIGRETTE
 Categories: Harned 1994, Salads, Side dish, Wild foods
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Vinegar or lemon juice
      6 tb Melted butter or salad oil
    1/2 ts Prepared mustard
    1/2 ts Each paprika and salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Chopped chives or
      1 ts Grated onion
      2    Hard-boiled eggs; chopped
      2 c  Fiddlehead ferns
           -- cooked and chilled
 
  Combine all ingredients except the last two; mix well. Arrange
  hard-boiled eggs over top of the chilled, cooked fiddleheads and pour
  vinaigrette sauce over all.
  
  The author wrote:  "Fiddleheads, the coiled tips of young fern
  fronds, are a springtime delicacy especially prized by New Englanders
  and wild foods enthusiasts.  Their season lasts only two weeks or so
  in May. Three kinds of the curled crosiers are gathered: those of the
  ostrich fern, the cinnamon fern, and the common bracken fern.
  
  "The fiddlehead is ready to pick when it is pushing up swiftly
  through the ground with its tightly coiled tip, shaped like the head
  of a fiddle. Fiddleheads are picked in the morning when they are
  woodsy-smelling and fresh flavored and snap off crisply into the hand
  of the picker. By afternoon the glowing green-coiled crosiers can
  have outgrown the edible stage, becoming unfurled fern fronds.
  
  "The cinnamon fern (Osmunda cinnamomea) fiddlehead is gathered when
  it is about eight inches tall.  The crosiers and one-half inch to two
  inches of the stem are eaten. A grayish-yellow woolly covering on the
  stems and tips must be removed (sometimes with difficulty) before the
  fiddleheads are cooked.  They are washed and then rubbed to remove
  the fuzz. Fiddleheads will keep for a couple of days in the
  refrigerator after picking, but wild flavors and freshness are
  transitory. Better to pick fiddleheads in the morning and eat them
  before night - or freeze them."
  
  "The ostrich fern (Pteris nodulosa)...is the tall, graceful plant that
  grows on stream and river banks where the water comes up in the early
  spring.  So abundant are the ostrich ferns in the lush natural
  ferneries of the Winooski valley near Waterbury, Vermont, that
  quantities of the fiddleheads are harvested, packed in snow, and
  transported to Maine where they are canned for sale in specialty food
  stores.
  
  "Fresh, crisp fiddleheads are steamed or boiled in salted water for
  20 to 30 minutes, until just tender. Their flavor hints of asparagus
  and mushrooms combined, and they are delectable served with either of
  these compatibly flavored foods.  But the best dish of plump
  fiddleheads is simmered gently and served hot, enhanced only by the
  simplest adornment of melted butters, served within hours after the
  crosiers are gathered..."

    1/2 c  Minced onion
    1/2 c  Diced green bell pepper

      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/8 ts Crushed dried red pepper
      2 c  Hot cooked rice
 
  In a heavy medium-size skillet, stir the sugar over moderate heat
  until it begins to melt.  Continue to cook until the syrup turns
  golden. Add the tablespoon of water, protecting your hands with a pot
  holder as the hot sugar may spatter.  Stir until the sugar is
  dissolved. Set this caramel aside.
  
  In a large skillet or saute pan, cook the salt pork until browned,
  stirring now and then.  Remove the pork bits with a slotted spoon,
  and set aside. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of pork drippings. Add
  the onion, green and red peppers, and celery.  Saute until the
  vegetables are tender. Add the shrimp and cook until they turn bright
  pink and are opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the shrimp and vegetables
  with a slotted spoon and keep them warm on a plate.  Add the
  remaining 1 cup water and 1 teaspoon of the caramel to the pan
  drippings. Bring to a boil, stir, and simmer 1 to 2 minutes. Season
  with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper.
  
  Return the shrimp and vegetables and the salt pork bits to the gravey
  and heat a minute or two.  Serve hot over rice.

      Title: FETA CHEESE SPINACH DIP
 Categories: Dips
      Yield: 96 Servings
 
      8 oz Cream cheese
     10 oz Feta cheese
     10 oz Spinach
    1/4 c  Milk
    1/2    Onions, chopped
      5    Garlic cloves, crushed
    1/4 c  Milk
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 tb Thyme
    1/4 ts Salt
      4    Coriander seeds
      1 tb Honey
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
 
  Put the cheeses into a blender, and mash them down. You'll need to
  add milk to get them to blend. Add just enough so that they blend
  well. Then, put the spinach in in small clumps. Blend, and put more
  spinach in, until the whole bunch is gone. You'll have a nice green
  goo.
  
  At this point, if you have a blender specifically for strong veggies,
  you can put the veggies in with the spinach. I put half the onion in
  before I realized that my roommate probably wouldn't like her shakes
  flavored with the faint taste of garlic and onion; I then carefully
  picked the onion out. You can skip that step
  :*)
  
  Pour the cheese mix into a medium saucepan. Mix the remaining
  ingredients in.  Add milk to taste.  Bring it slow boil, and cook
  until it's a little more liquidy than you want: it'll thicken as it
  cools.
  
  Eat with dippin' chips. Tortilla chips work great, too. Also good on
  french bread. (Advice: make this just before the party.
   Otherwise, there won't be any left.)

 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 oz Prosciutto
      4 oz Butter
      2 tb Minced onion
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper

    2/3 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
 
  SEPARATE FAT AND LEAN parts of prosciutto. Chop fat coarsely; cut
  lean into 1/2-inch squares. (If prosciutto has little or no fat,
  simply increase butter by 1 to 2 tablespoons.) Melt butter in a
  skillet. Add onion and prosciutto fat and saute 5 minutes. Add
  prosciutto squares and saute 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, salt very
  lightly and pepper generously. With a slotted spoon, remove half the
  prosciutto and reserve. Boil the fettuccine in a large quantity of
  salted water 1-2 minutes, until al dente. Drain in a colander but not
  too thoroughly: leave them a little moist. Transfer fettuccine to a
  heated serving bowl. Toss with entire contents of saute pan. Add

 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Semolina flour
      1 c  All-purpose unbleached flour
      2    Eggs
           Olive oil
      1 ds Salt
      1 c  Butter or margarine
           - softened
           Grated Parmesan cheese
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Combine flours in large bowl. Mix well. Make well in center of flour
  and drop in eggs, 1 tablespoon oil and salt. Using fork, beat mixture
  into flour, working up to rim gradually and incorporating wet
  ingredients with flour thoroughly. If too dry, add a few drops of
  water. When combined, moisten hands with oil and work dough, kneading
  and folding about 10 minutes until smooth and pliable. Continue
  kneading 5 minutes longer until dough is completely smooth.
  (Kneading, because of toughness of semolina flour, will be difficult,
  but keep going. Keep hands moistened with oil during kneading process
  to help stretch dough and make it pliable.) Form into ball, cover and
  let stand 10 minutes to rest. Process through pasta machine according
  to manufacturer's directions or roll very thin. Cut for fettuccine
  noodles. Use at once or allow to dry and store for future use.
  
  When ready to serve, drop fettuccine in boiling salted water and cook
  until fettuccine rises to surface, about 2 minutes. Quickly drain and
  place in warm bowl containing half of softened butter. Top with lumps
  of remaining butter and 1/3 to 1/2 cup cheese. Toss lightly, using
  fork and spoon, about 2 minutes, until fettuccine is well coated and
  creamy sauce is formed. Serve sprinkled with pepper and additional
  grated cheese.

  and chop into bite-sized pieces, then arrange in mounds on the edge
  of a serving plate. Steam broccoli florets until bright green and
  still crunchy, remove from steamer and place on platter alongside
  spinach. Dice 2 of the carrots and place in a small saucepan with the
  wine, broth, onion or shallots, garlic and tarragon. Bring to a boil,
  cover, and cook until carrots are tender. Uncover and boil until
  liquid is reduced to about 2 tablespoons: Remove from heat. Mash
  carrots with their liquid, using a fork or food processor. When the
  mixture cools to just warm, whisk in the butter. Set aside. Bring a
  large pot of water to a boil. Add broccoli stems and pasta. It should
  take about 3 minutes for both the pasta and broccoli to be cooked to
  perfection. (Judge doneness by the pasta -- it's better to have the
  broccoli underdone than the pasta overdone.) Meanwhile, finely grate
  remaining carrots. When pasta and broccoli are al dente, drain and
  serve, surrounded by the spinach mounds and broccoli florets. Spoon
  carrot-butter over pasta and vegetables, and sprinkle grated carrot
  over the top. Serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.

  1 1/2 c  Fresh basil leaves -- firmly
           Packed
      1 c  Romano cheese -- grated
     10 tb Extra virgin olive oil
      1 lg Yellow onion -- chopped
      4    Cloves garlic -- minced
      2 c  Vegetable broth
      1 lb Fettuccine -- semolina
    1/2 c  Pine nuts -- toasted
           Salt and pepper
 
  Cook 1 cup of dried cranberry beans to be recipe-ready. Follow package
  
  In a blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine
  the basil, cheese and 6 tablespoons of olive oil. Process until
  smooth. Set aside. Toast the pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium
  heat for 4 to 5 minutes.  Set aside. In a large frying pan over
  medium heat, warm the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil. Add the
  onion and garlic and saute, stirring until soft, about 10 minutes.
  Add the stock and the (rinsed) beans, bring to a boil, reduce the
  heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the stock is reduced by
  one-fourth (5 to 10 minutes). Meanwhile, cook the fettuccine until al
  dente (refer to package for times). Drain and place in a warmed
  serving bowl. Add the bean mixture, basil mixture, pine nuts. Taste
  and season with salt and pepper (freshly grind). Toss and serve.
  Optional garnish: whole basil leaves.
  
  Alternative Ingredients-- Beans: Try kidney, cannellini, chick-peas,
  small white beans, black-eyes peas. (Borlotti is Italian for
  Cranberry beans) Pasta: Two-color - egg and a spinach-egg. Try
  linguine. Pesto: Equal parts of basil and flat-leaf parsley or add a
  little cilantro. Cheese: romano, pecorino, parmesan -- freshly grated
  Broth: chicken or vegetable or water or some combination.
  
  Cooks Note:  You can drastically cut back the olive oil by using
  spray and Sweat-frying whenever possible. Do add a little light oil
  for flavor and texture to the final bean sauce. Recipe By

      Title: FETTUCCINE WITH ROASTED EGGPLANT~ PEPPERS & B
 Categories: Italian, Main dish, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Pasta
  1 1/2 lb Eggplant
      6 tb Virgin olive oil
      3    Garlic cloves
     20    Nicoise or Gaeta olives
           Pitted and chopped
    1/2 c  Basil leaves coarsely choppd
           Salt and fresh ground pepper
      2    Bell peppers, red or yellow
      1 c  Bread crumbs
           Balsamic vinegar to taste
           Parmesan or Romano cheese
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees
  
  Prick eggplant in several places and then bake the whole eggplant(s)
  until they are wrinkled and soft, about 20 minutes. (Cooking time
  will depend on the size of the eggplants.) Turn them once halfway
  through cooking.
  
  Let the eggplant(s) cool a few minutes, then slit them open and peel
  away the skins. Shred or tear the eggplants into pieces and combine
  them with olive oil, garlic, olives and half the basil. Add the
  roasted pepper strips. (To roast your own, see below.) Season with
  salt and pepper , and set aside.
  
  Toss breadcrumbs with enough oil to moisten them and toast them in a
  hot oven (400 degrees) until they are crisp and golden. Remove and
  set aside.
  
  When you are ready to cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted
  water to a boil. Transfer the eggplant-pepper mix to a large skillet
  and warm gently over low heat. Add pasta to water and cook until al
  dente. Drain pasta and add it to the vegetable mixture, stirring
  gently to combine. Add the remaining basil leaves and season to tast
  with salt, freshly ground pepper and splash of vinegar.
  
  Divide pasta amoung four plates. Garnish each with breadcrumbs and
  pass around the grated cheese.
  
  To roast peppers: Set whole peppers just beneath a preheated broiler.
  Turn, using long-handled tongs, until all sides are charred black.
  Transfer to a mixing bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. When
  peppers are cool enough to handle, pull off blackened skins, and
  remove cores, seeds and veins. Cut into strips about 1/4-inch wide.

      6    Whole heads garlic
  1 1/4 lb Fettuccine
      6 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
           Salt
      1 pn Of ground dried chili
 
  Fettuccine con Crema di Aglio e Peperoncino From the Williams-Sonoma
  Kitchen Library Pasta Cookbook by Lorenza de Medici "Whole roasted
  garlic heads have such a wonderful fragrance and flavor that you
  might want to bake a few extra, for guests to squeeze onto crusty
  chunks of bread. You can also make a similar onion sauce: roast 3
  small brown-skinned onions, using the same method as for the garlic
  heads, peel them and puree with the oil in a food processor.  Both
  versions of the California cuisine-inspired sauce are also excellent
  at room temperature."
  
  Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  Wrap each head of garlic separately
  in aluminum foil.  Place the parcels on a rack in the center of the
  oven and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the garlic heads from the oven
  and set aside to cool slightly so that they can be handled. In a
  large pot bring 6 qt salted water to a boil.  Add the fettuccine to
  the boiling water and cook until al dente. Meanwhile, unwrap the
  garlic heads, separate the cloves and squeeze the garlic cloves from
  their papery sheaths into a hot serving bowl. Add the olive oil and
  season to taste with salt. Sprinkle with the chili and blend together
  well with a fork. Drain the pasta and transfer it to the serving
  bowl. Toss the pasta with the sauce. Serve immediately. Serves 6.

  cook until the tomatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes. Stir
  occasionally to break up the tomato pieces. Add the basil, sugar and
  salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Combine the goat cheese and the remaining peppers in a food processor
  or blender. Process until the peppers are finely chopped and the
  cheese is very creamy.

      Title: FETTUCINE ALFREDO
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Unsalted (sweet) butter,
      1 lb Fresh Fettucine noodles
    1/2 c  Light cream (or diluted
           -Creme Fraiche),
      1 c  Freshly grated parmesan
           -cheese,
      1    Pinch of nutmeg,
      1    Pinch of fresh parsley
           -(optional),
      1    Little pepper (optional).
 
  Put water on to boil for the noodles.  As the water comes to a boil,
  start preparing  the sauce.  In  a separate pan melt unsalted (sweet)
  butter over very low heat - DO NOT LET IT BROWN!!
  
  Once  the butter has melted, stir into the butter: light cream (or the
  diluted Creme Fraiche), freshly grated parmesan cheese. Beat this
  with a whisk to keep the sauce from clumping. Once the sauce is
  smooth, season the sauce with a pinch of nutmeg, a pinch of fresh
  parsley (optional), and a little   pepper (optional).
  
  Turn the sauce down to a simmer and add fresh Fettucine noodles (or a
  batch of homemade noodles) to the boiling water. When the noodles are
  cooked al dente, drain and toss  gently  with sauce. Serve
  immediately.
  
  The order of these steps is important, as it is better to make the
  sauce wait for the noodles than to make the noodles wait for the
  sauce.

  Classic Mediterranean food, a creamy mushroom sauce is folded into
  freshly cooked fettucine, and an egg lightly scrambled into the
  mixture at the last moment until it is lightly set. Serve this with a
  garlicky green salad and some warm granary bread.
  
  Simmer the sliced onion gently in the oil until thoroughly softened,
  then add the herbs and let them soften too, stirring. Add the
  mushrooms and stir them until their juices start to run. Stir the
  cream into the mixture and heat through. Pour the sauce over the hot,
  drained fettucine in a saucepan, and put over a very gentle heat.
  Finally add the beaten egg and cook slowly, stirring, until the egg
  begins to set. Check the seasoning and serve at once on warm plates.
  Sprinkle grated Parmesan over the top.

      3 sl Bacon, cut into 1" pieces
      3 tb Onion, diced
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed
    3/4 c  White wine
    3/4 c  Half-and-half
    1/2 c  Romano cheese, grated
      1    Egg yolk
      2 x  Servings fettucini, cooked
           Chopped parsley for garnish
 
  In an 10" pan, fry the bacon until the fatty portions are just
  beginning to turn clear.  Add the onion, and saute over high heat
  until the onion is translucent. Drain off the fat, remove the bacon
  and onion, and set aside. Add the garlic to the pan, and deglaze the
  pan with the wine, scraping up any bacon leavings.  Simmer for about
  1 minute. Add the half-and-half to the pan, and wait until the sauce
  come back up to the simmer (with practice, this can be done so that
  the half-and-half does not curdle in the wine.  If it does curdle,
  that's okay - the taste will still be there, it just won't look as
  nice).  Add the Romano cheese (parmesan is acceptable, but the taste
  will be a little more pungent), and stir until smooth, about 30
  seconds. At this point, the sauce may be removed from the heat and
  held for about 15 minutes. To serve, bring the sauce back up to
  temperature. Add the cooked fettucini to the pan and toss to coat the
  pasta. Add the bacon, onion and raw egg yolk, and toss to mix
  thoroughly. Dish onto two plates, garnish with a bit of chopped
  parsley, and serve immediately.
