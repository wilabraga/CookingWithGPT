      Title: HOT YEAST ROLLS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
      2 pk Active dry yeast
      1 tb Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Water,very warm
    1/4 c  Butter,cut into small pieces
      2 c  Milk,warm
      6 c  Flour,all-purpose
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Butter,melted
 
  1. In a large bowl sprinkle yeast and sugar over warm water (should
  feel comfortably warm when dropped on wrist) and allow to stand until
  bubbly, about 10 minutes. 2. Combine butter and milk in top of double
  boiler over simmering water until butter has melted and milk is warm.
  Add to yeast mixture and stir until blended. Mix in 2 cups of the
  flour, 1 cup at a time, and beat well to form a spongy dough. Cover
  and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2
  hours. Stir down with wooden spoon, then add about 3 more cups of
  flour to form a moist dough that is firm enough to turn out onto a
  well-floured board. 3. Dip hands in flour and knead dough until
  smooth and nonsticky, adding additional flour as needed. The dough
  should be velvety-smooth. 4. Form into a ball and place in a
  well-buttered, warm mixing bowl. Turn ball of dough so that entire
  surface of dough is coated with softened butter. Cover and again
  place in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 hour. 5. Punch
  dough down, turn out onto a lightly floured board, and let rest for
  about 5 minutes. 6. Roll out to a thickness of about 1/2 inch cut
  with a floured knife first into approximate 2-inch squares, then into
  triangles. Roll up from wide side to point and place on baking sheet
  about 1/4 inch apart. When all are prepared, brush with melted butter
  and again let rise until about double in bulk, about 30 minutes. 7.
  Bake in a preheated 350'F. oven until lightly browned, 25 to 30
  minutes, depending on size. To test for doneness gently tap top of
  roll for a hollow sound or break open one roll to see if it is
  sufficiently baked in the center.

      Title: HOT-&-SOUR MUSHROOM SOUP (TOM YUM HET)
 Categories: Thai, Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 c  Defatted reduced-sodium
           -chicken stock
    1/2 lb Oyster mushrooms, trimmed
           -and halved
    1/4 lb Straw mushrooms, trimmed and
           -halved
      2    Serrano chilies, with seeds,
           -cut into thin strips
      1    One-inch piece fresh lemon
           -grass or: *
      2    Fresh kaffir lime leaves or:
           -**
      3 tb Fresh lime juice
      3 tb Fish sauce
 
  * 1 Tbsp. dried, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes and drained ** 4
  dried, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes, drained, or 1/2 tsp.
  grated lime zest
  
  This classic central That dish is traditionally made with shrimp or
  chicken, but we prefer using oyster mushrooms since they are just as
  meaty in texture and yet more subtle in taste. Although it is served
  as a soup course in North American Thai restaurants, it actually
  falls somewhere between a soup and a curry. In Thailand, it is served
  as a condiment to rice, just like any of the other dishes on the
  table.
  
  In a medium-sized saucepan, bring stock to a boil and add mushrooms
  and chilies. Tie lemon grass and lime leaves or zest together in a
  cheesecloth bag and add to the stock mixture. Cook over medium heat
  for about 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender. Reduce heat
  to low and add lime juice and fish sauce. Discard the cheesecloth
  bag. Serve the soup hot, accompanied by steamed rice.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Beef short ribs *
           *cut in 1-in lengths
      4    Garlic cloves
           - peeled and minced
      2    1-in cubes ginger
           - peeled and minced
      3 md Scallions; trimmed & minced
    2/3 c  Soy sauce
      2 tb Sesame oil
  1 1/2 ts Spicy sesame oil
      1 tb Sugar
      2 tb Cider vinegar
      1 tb Mirin (sweet rice wine)
    1/4 tb Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Toasted sesame seeds
 
  TOAST THE SESAME SEEDS by spreading them over the bottom of a pie tin.
  Roast them at 300F for 12-to-16 minutes. Stir sesame seeds often,
  until they are golden. With a very sharp knife, score the meat on
  each short rib in a crisscross pattern, making the cuts about
  3/8-inch apart and cutting almost to the bone. This will allow the
  marinade to penetrate and help tenderize the meat. Place the short
  ribs in a large shallow baking pan. Combine the rest of the
  ingredients, pour the marinade over the meat and toss well to mix.
  Cover and refrigerate the ribs for 24 hours, turning them in the
  marinade several times. When you are ready to cook the short ribs,
  preheat the oven to 325F. Arrange the ribs on a rack in a shallow
  roasting pan. Brush ribs with a little of the marinade. Roast them
  uncovered for 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, turn the ribs
  and brush them with the marinade. Raise the oven temperature to 500F.
  After the ribs have stood for 10 minutes at room temperature, return
  them to the oven and roast them for 5 minutes. Turn them again, baste
  them lavishly with the marinade and roast them for 3 to 5 minutes
  longer for rare, about 8 minutes for medium-rare. Brush the ribs with
  any remaining marinade and serve them with fluffy boiled rice and a
  crisp salad. Makes 4 to 6 Servings

      Title: HOT-SMOKED TROUT
 Categories: Game, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Red-meated trout, 2 to 3
           -pounds
      2 ts Kosher salt
      2 ts Sugar
      1 c  (approximately) hardwood
           -smoking chips (preferably
           -alder or fruitwood)
 
  Filet the fish (or have the fishmonger do it), leaving the skin on.
  If you want a completely boneless filet, use tweezers or clean
  needle-nose pliers to remove the dozen or so pin bones running down
  the middle of the filet near the head end. Place the filets skin side
  down in a glass or stainless steel baking pan or other deep dish.
  
  Combine the salt and sugar and sprinkle a generous layer all over the
  fish, more thickly on the thickest part of the meat, a little less on
  the tail and edges. Use about a tablespoon in all for a 2-pound fish,
  the full amount for a 3-pounder. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to
  overnight.
  
  Drain off any juices that have collected in the pan. Add cold water to
  cover, let stand 15 minutes, drain, and repeat. Drain well and pat
  dry with paper towels. For a smoother surface, lay the filets on a
  wire rack in a cool, breezy place for 15 minutes to dry.
  
  Build a small charcoal fire (10 to 12 briquets) at one edge of a
  covered grill and let it burn down until covered with gray ash.
  
  Meanwhile, soak 1/2 cup of the smoking chips in water. Cover the
  grill and adjust the vents on the top and bottom to maintain a
  temperature of about 200 degrees F. Drain the chips and add them to
  the coals; replace the grill with one handle nearest the fire, to
  facilitate adding smoking chips. Lay the filets on the opposite side
  from the fire, with the thickest parts nearest the heat. Cover and
  cook until the fish is opaque, 30 to 40 minutes. Add some dry smoking
  chips to the fire every 15 minutes or so to maintain smoke and heat.
  Serve hot or cold.

      Title: HOW CANNING PRESERVES FOODS
 Categories: Canning, Information, Preserves
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  The high percentage of water in most fresh foods makes them very
  perishable. They spoil or lose their quality for several reasons:
  
  * growth of undesirable microorganisms- bacteria, molds, and yeasts, *
  activity of food enzymes, * reactions with oxygen, * moisture loss.
  
  Microorganisms live and multiply quickly on the surfaces of fresh
  food and on the inside of bruised, insect-damaged, and diseased food.
  Oxygen and enzymes are present throughout fresh food tissues. Proper
  canning practices include:
  
  * carefully selecting and washing fresh food, * peeling some fresh
  foods, * hot packing many foods, * adding acids (lemon juice or
  vinegar) to some foods, * using acceptable jars and self-sealing
  lids, * processing jars in a boiling-water or pressure canner for the
  correct period of time.
  
  Collectively, these practices remove oxygen; destroy enzymes; prevent
  the growth of undesirable bacteria, yeasts, and molds; and help form
  a high vacuum in jars. Good vacuums form tight seals which keep
  liquid in and air and microorganisms out.

      Title: HOW SOAP IS MADE
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1    Information
 
  When grease and lye are heated together, a chemical reaction called
  saponification occurs.  The resulting product is soap. To put it in
  simpler terms, soap is made by a boiling process. Cold water, lye,
  and grease--your choice of hydrogenated vegetable oils (like Crisco),
  tallow, or lard--are heated and boiled. Liquid vegetable oils also
  may be used. Once the mixture thickens to a gravylike texture, it is
  saponified and needs to be removed from the heat and cooled.
  Saponifi- cation is the chemical reaction that takes place in the
  boiling process of soap making. What occurs is chemically complex.
  Simple fats do not combine with the alkali (lye) to form soap. First,
  they decompose (water acts as a solvent base) into fatty acids and
  glycerols, which then combine, forming soap. Pour the hot liquid into
  the molds before it has completely cooled. Do not let it cool too
  long in the pan. Soap hardens as it cools. If left in the pan, it
  will completely harden into one giant glob of soap, something you
  will not want. Cut the soap into similarly shaped bars after you have
  poured it into a shallow pan. You should use a wire to cut the soap
  because it will be able to cut the soap evenly and make attractive
  cakes of similar width and length.  Do not use a knife, or you might
  have bars that are not equal in appearance. You want people to be
  impressed by your homemade soaps, not to laugh at you. Soap making is
  easy, but it requires concentration to detail. Children and pets
  should not be present when soap is being made. They are too
  distracting and likely to be unaware of the serious hazards involved
  in making soap. Lock the doors and keep them out of the room when
  making soap. If necessary, hire a babysitter, or drop the kids and
  pets off with mom and dad. Be sure that there are no other
  distractions while you make your soap. Take the telephone off the
  hook and turn off the television and radio. You must give your total
  attention to the task at hand. That is the only safe and practical
  way to make soap. There are no special skills required to make soap.
  However, you must follow instructions for success and for safety's
  sake.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -cold water
      2    Lemons
           Artichokes
 
    Have a large bowl at hand, containing cold water and the juice of
  two lemon with the four halves of the rind. Keep the artichokes in
  another bowl of cold water while you are working on them. Take one
  artichoke at a time, drain it, and pull off and discard the smallest
  outer leaves. Holding the artichoke with its bottom toward the little
  finger of your hand, tilt the top away from you, and holding a small
  sharp knife tightly with your right hand, insert its tip, one leaf
  deep, into the tender, lighter part of the leaves. Keeping your right
  hand steady, slowly rotate the artichoke with your left hand so the
  bottom moves in a clockwise direction, and cut upward in a spiral.
  The tough part of each leaf will fall off, while the tender edible
  part remains attached. Peel the green layer off the bottom and stem,
  and then drop the trimmed artichoke into the lemon juice until you
  are ready to cook. This operation requires some practice; you will
  know if you have mastered this technique when the artichoke thus
  cleaned looks more or less like the one you started with, only
  smaller and whiter.
    If you are not ready to use the artichokes immediately after you
  have cleaned them, try to keep them completely submerged in lemon
  water. This is not easy. Artichokes are very buoyant and float to the
  surface making it difficult to keep them covered. An inverted plate,
  just a bit smaller in diameter than the bowl, place over the
  artichokes, will keep them below the surface. Another way is to crowd
  them inside a glass jar and cover them with the lemon water. If you
  plan to leave them at this stage for more than a hour or so, you must
  refrigerate them, but it is not advisable to keep artichokes this way
  for more than a few hours. Lemon is used to prevent discoloration; on
  the other hand, the lemon will cause the artichokes to spoil very
  quickly."

      Title: HOW TO COOK A DUCK
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Duckling, (4- to 5-lb)
      1 tb Kosher salt
      1 ts Ground black pepper
 
  REMOVE ANY GIBLETS from the cavity of the bird and reserve. Remove
  any fat deposits from the cavity and cut off excess skin around the
  neck. Rinse the bird under cold running water and pat dry. Sprinkle
  the cavity with salt and pepper. Sever the wing tips at the first
  joint and reserve with the giblets. Tie the legs together at the
  ankles and sprinkle the outside of the duck with salt and pepper. If
  you don't have a steamer, improvise one. Use a roasting rack or
  create one by placing 2 small heatproof baking dishes or loaf pans
  upside down in a larger roasting pan. Fill roasting pan with a 2-inch
  depth of water and place the bird breast up on the rack. Cover
  tightly with the lid or with aluminum foil. Place over high heat on
  top of the stove. When the water boils, reduce heat to low and steam
  approximately 15 minutes per pound. Remove from the heat and transfer
  the birds to a plate. Strain the steaming liquid into a container,
  cool and place in the refrigerator. When chilled, remove the fat and
  pack into containers, discarding any water. Place in the refrigerator
  until ready to cook, or in the freezer for up to 1 year. Use the fat
  for frying and sauteeing. Place the bird on its side in a roasting
  pan, add reserved giblets, neck and wings, place in the oven and turn
  oven temperature to 350F. After about 15 minutes, turn birds on the
  other side and cook an additional 10 minutes. Turn the bird breast up
  and cook another 20 minutes, basting the bird as it renders fat. In
  all, cook about 9 minutes per pound or about 45 minutes for a 5-lb
  duck, about 7 minutes per pound for an 11-lb goose. Remove the bird
  from the oven and set the bird aside on a platter. Remove any
  trussing and serve with sauce.

      Yield: 1 Broadside
 
           Info
 
  As Mr. Glass said of the hare, you first must catch him. Having done
  so, the mode of cooking him so as to make a good dish of him is as
  follows: Many good husbands are spoiled in the cooking; some women go
  about it as if their husbands were bladders, and blow them up. Others
  keep them constantly in hot water, while others freeze them by
  conjugal coldness. Some smother them with hatred, contention and
  variance, and some keep them in pickle all their lives.
  
  These women always serve them up with tongue sauce.  Now it cannot be
  supposed that husbands will be tender and good if managed in this
  way. But they are, on the contrary, very delicious when managed as
  follows: Get a large jar called the jar of carefulmess, (which all
  good wives have on hand) place your husband in it, and set him near
  the fire of conjugal love; let the fire be be pretty hot, but
  especially let it be clear-above all let it be constant.  Cover him
  over with affection, kindness and subjection. Garnish him with
  modest, becoming familiarity and the spice of pleasantry and if you
  add kisses and other confectioneries let them be accompanied with a
  sufficient portion of secrecy; mixed with prudence and moderation. We
  would advise all good wives to try this receipt and realize how
  admirable a dish a husband is when properly cooked.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  Remove any damaged or discolored leaves from the outside of the
  artichoke. With a sharp knife, cut the stem off flush at the bottom
  so that the artichoke will stand upright without tipping.
  
  Simmer the artichoke, covered, in about 3/4" of water for 25 to 35
  minutes. The artichoke is done when a leaf plucked from near the
  center comes off easily. Drain the artichoke upside down.
  
  With the exception of the hairy "choke" in the middle, the entire
  artichoke is edible, although most of the leaf is tough and usually
  only the pasty part of the inside of the leaf is eaten (scraped off
  with your teeth!). The best part is the base of the artichoke, which
  has a mellow, sweet flavor.
  
  Artichokes are traditionally served with a dip of some sort -- usually
  melted butter, but mayonnaise or vinaigrette is equally delicious.

      Title: HOW TO COOK DRY BEANS
 Categories: Instruction, Information
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  Before Cooking ============== There are several accepted ways of
  preparing dry beans for cooking. All start with a thorough washing in
  cold water and inspection for damaged beans and foreign material. If
  you have time to cook the variety you have chosen until it reaches
  the desired tenderness, soaking is not essential. However, most cooks
  prefer some method of soaking to shorten cooking time and to improve
  either flavor, texture, appearance or digestibility. In either of the
  soaking methods below, it is recommended that the soaking water be
  discarded and the beans rinsed and cooked in fresh water.
  
  Soaking Tips ============ Recent studies have shown that bringing
  beans to a boil, then soaking for 12 or more hours makes them more
  digestible. Therefore, the revised method for traditional soaking is
  given here. The quick method is acceptable for occasions when time is
  limited.
  
  Traditional Method: Wash one pound dry beans. Add to 10 cups boiling
  water; boil 2 minutes. Remove from heat; cover and soak 12 hours or
  overnight. Drain, rinse and cook.
  
  Quick Method: Wash one pound dry beans. Add to 10 cups boiling water;
  boil 2 to 1 minutes. Cover and soak 1 to 4 hours. Drain, rinse and
  cook. Be sure pot is large enough to allow beans to expand 2-1/2
  times.
  
  Cooking/Storage Tips Cooking Method: Drain and rinse soaked beans;
  put into large kettle. Add 6 cups hot water, 1 to 2 tablespoons
  shortening or oil and 2 teaspoons salt. Boil gently with lid tilted
  until tender. Cooking time will range from 30 to 60 minutes,
  depending on variety of bean.
  
  * Simmer beans slowly. Cooking too fast can break skins.
  
  * Cook enough beans for more than one meal at a time. For storing a
  day or two, cover and refrigerate. For longer storage, freeze in
  airtight plastic bags or freezer-proof containers.
  
  Bean Equivalents ================ One pound of dry beans equals about
  2-1/4 cups dry or 5 to 6 cups cooked beans. One can (15-1/2 oz.),
  drained, equals about 1-2/3 cups.

      Title: HOW TO COOK SPAGHETTI SQUASH
 Categories: Digest, Text
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Spaghetti squash
 
  The flesh of spaghetti squash, when cooked, comes out like strands of
  cooked spaghetti and makes a great light stand-in for pasta lovers.
  
  Prepare squash by cutting in half lengthwise and removing seeds.
  Pierce skin several times with a fork and follow one of the cooking
  methods below.
  
  To bake, prepare squash, and place, cut side down, in a large baking
  pan. Bake at 350 oF for 45 minutes or until skin is tender and
  strands may be loosened easily with a fork.
  
  To microwave, prepare squash, and place, cut side down, in a baking
  dish. Add 1/4 cup water; cover with plastic wrap, folding back a
  small edge of wrap to allow steam to escape. Cook on HIGH 7 to 10
  minutes.
  
  To boil, prepare squash, and place, cut side down, in a Dutch oven,
  add water to a depth of 2 inches. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce
  heat, and simmer 20 to 25 minutes or until tender. Drain.
  
  Cool cooked squash. Using a fork, remove spaghetti-like strands of
  pulp. Discard shell.
  
  Yield: 1 medium spaghetti squash equals about 4 cups cooked.

      Title: HOW TO COOK WHOLE HOGS PT 1
 Categories: Main, April97, Extras
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           SEE DIRECTIONS
 
  1.Have the slaughter-house clean the hawg but have them leave on the
  head, all feet, and tail (a cap goes on the tail.)  Also tell them
  not to damage the ears (some slaughter-houses think they have to
  suspend the hawg by grabbing them with some sort of hanging device
  around the base of the ears, but we have found that they can do this
  without harming the ears.) Also, if you can remember, have them prop
  the mouth open with a stick because an apple must go in the mouth,
  and most humans are not strong enough to open the mouth for this
  purpose. 2.Hawgs in the weight range of 8O-12O pounds dressed (where
  dressed means a hawg that has been cleaned but has the head, feet,
  and tail attached.) usually cook best. We've cooked hawgs as large as
  396 pounds dressed, but we don't recommend it. The amount of meat per
  person will depend on the group.  An all-men group will consume a
  good bit more than a mixed group, particularly if the people in the
  mixed group have never attended one of these.  If they have attended
  one previously and found that the hawg didn't kill 'em, then they
  will eat more. We suggest one pound of dressed hawg per person. 3.We
  do not dig a pit in Mississippi due to the clay.  Build a pit of
  concrete blocks two blocks high, five blocks long, and three blocks
  wide (for one hawg) on flat ground or slightly sloping ground which
  will help drain the grease away. This takes a total of 32 blocks. If
  you are short a few blocks, you can get by with 28 blocks by making
  the pit four blocks long. 4.Line the bottom of the pit with freezer
  foil, not regular aluminum foil as it is too thin. 5.Spread out a few
  bricks (five or six) in the bottom of the pit. 6.Place a fine steel
  grate (or fine wire mesh) on the bricks in the bottom of the pit.
  This will prevent large grease fires if you pay attention and
  immediately put out the small fires which start when grease drops
  down on the hot coals.  (Doss likes to use a water (squirt) bottle
  for this. I think that's cheatin' and should be done by using the
  small coal shovel to spread the coals away from the small fires.)
  7.Place the rods across the top of the blocks with another piece of
  fine steel grate on top of the rods. The hawg will go on top of this
  grate. (Actually we now use a steel grate that has long lengths of
  small sized angle-iron down each side that reaches across the pit and
  the hawg goes directly on this grate.) 8.When the hawg arrives, start
  four or five pounds of charcoal in the charcoal cooker. (This cooker
  is used only to get the coals ready to place under the hawg.) 9.To
  prepare the hawg do the following:  Rip-out the kidneys and any extra
  tubes, etc. (like the aorta) that the hawg will no longer need. Take
  the single bladed ax and hammer and start splitting the backbone so
  the hawg will lay flat on the grate.  (This method of cookin' is
  called butterfly cookin', so you want to open him up so he will
  lay-out (like a flyin' squirrel).)DO NOT CUT THROUGH THE SKIN or you
  will have BIG-TIME problems later on. In fact, don't cut the skin in
  any way, or poke any holes in the skin. After you get the hawg
  laid-out, the apple is next.  Have your stoutest guy or gal pull the
  mouth open and stick an apple in it.  I have seen this done once. If
  you have no Paul Bunyan around, use item 11 in the equipment list.
  The apple is necessary because he will bite the apple when he is
  done. 10.After the hawg is prepared, lay him belly down on the grate.
  Place a nice hat on his head between his ears, shades on his eyes,
  and an Ole Miss baseball cap on his rear end.  The hawg won't cook
  without these items. 11.Now take pictures with the bosses up front
  and the real workers in the rear, or better yet with the real workers
  not even in the picture. The reason for the pictures is that all
  night long you will swear you are getting nowhere in cookin' this
  hawg, but 24 hours later you can prove you started with a raw hawg.
  The reason for the bosses being up front is because they will be
  there anyway. besides, this may encourage them to pay for everything,
  and they are of no use for anything else anyway. 12.You are ready to
  start cookin` now.  Use the small coal shovel to place 2 to 3 coals
  under each ham and each shoulder.  (NO MORE COALS THAN THIS!) 13.You
  will now start getting verbal abuse about how the hawg won't cook, it
  will be raw, any fool would know better, etc, etc.  Tell them fine,
  they don't have to eat any of it tomorrow.  Then replenish the
  charcoals you took out of the charcoal cooker and head for the beer
  cooler. (You only have to start the charcoal once. After the first
  time, simply spread the hot charcoal out so that when the charcoal
  gets hot, it is about time to put more coals under the hawg.  I would
  guess this works out to be about every 3O to 4O minutes. More on this
  in instruction number 16 below.) 14.Say you want to eat the hawg(s)
  at 5 P.M. on a Saturday.  (All that follows relative to time will be
  based on this assumed eating time. For any other eating time apply a
  suitable forward or backward shift operator.) We usually pick the
  hawg up and get him to the site by at least 4 P.M. on Friday. You
  should be able to get him stated cookin' by 4:3O or 5:OO P.M. on
  Friday. The hawg is to be turned over only once.  He will probably
  need to be turned over on his back between 8 A.M. and 1O A.M. on
  Saturday at that "moment-of-perfection," and I don't know how to
  describe to you what that continued in part 2

           See part 1
 
  "moment-of-perfection" is, so just turn him at 9:41 A.M. on Saturday.
  
  15.After starting the hawg at 5 P.M. on Friday, continue cookin' him
  by adding coals now and then. You can leave him uncovered on the pit
  for viewing until around 10 P.M. Friday night. Then you need to cover
  him. Cover him first with one piece of sheet iron that DOES NOT TOUCH
  THE HAWG ANYWHERE EXCEPT THE FEET AND EARS. We use a special piece of
  bent sheet iron that does not touch the hawg. Over this sheet iron
  place a small tarp that covers the pit. This is essentially our
  cooking oven. 16.The rate at which coals are applied comes, I
  suppose, from experience. For the entire 24 hours of cooking, you
  should use slightly less than one pound of charcoal per pound of
  hawg. For example, for a 1OO pound dressed hawg (including head and
  feet), we would buy 1OO pounds of charcoal, but we would probably
  only use around 8O to 9O pounds of charcoal. The key to cookin' is to
  START SLOW and don't eveer get much faster. Just be PERSISTENT. It is
  a low-temperature/long-duration cooking process. Every time one of
  our cookers have described to someone else how to cook a hawg, they
  usually cook too fast and ruin the hawg. 17.After the hawg is turned
  over, grease will drip, or even run at times, so one should not put
  the coals where the grease drips. (Actually it will begin dripping
  long before it's turned but the greatest danger of significant grease
  fires occurs after turning.) We usually place the coals more around
  the edges after turning. This will not hurt the cooking rate because
  the sheet iron and tarp will be like an oven. This locating of hot
  coals is, of course, to prevent grease fires. We have never had a
  large grease fire since we started using the raised steel grate on
  the bottom of the pit. Before the use of the steel grate we had some
  big-time grease fires that even Ward would love. 18.Also after the
  hawg is turned you should baste (or pour) barbecue sauce on the
  bottom side of the hawg which is now turned up. This doesn't get any
  barbecue flavor into the meat, it only keeps the meat from getting
  dry on this side, so any kind of sauce will do. We usually serve the
  barbecue sauce on the side, so that people can have hot, or mild, or
  whatever they want, or whatever you have to offer. Repeat this
  basting every couple of hours.
  
  19.When the hawg is done (by definition he is done at 5 P.M., and at
  this time he will bite the apple in two) pick him up by using the
  rods or sucker rod grate and move him to a place in the food line on
  the saw horses. Use two cutters, or pullers, on either side of the
  hawg. The best thing to do if the hawg is cooked properly is for
  these pullers to put on the rubber gloves (the thicker the glove the
  better because the meat will be hot) and simply pull the meat off and
  pull it apart. Do not use swine experts or veterinarians for this, as
  they don't seem to know the difference between a ham and a
  tenderloin. Be careful to not break the skin, the grease (which you
  will not notice dripping through) can ruin a good pair of Justin
  boots in no time.

  Well, with all the talk about the corned beef and how much salt it
  has, I dug out the following recipe that was used on the farm to make
  "Corn or Pickled Beef Or Venison."
  
  It is best to cut the meat into 4 to 6 lb pieces. Have barrel ready
  and spread a layer of salt on the bottom. Rub each piece of meat wtih
  a mixture of salt and pepper and pack down in layers, covering each
  with a layer of salt.  The top layer should be of salt. Let stand
  overnight.
  
  In the morning pour on the following brine: For 25 lbs of meat: 3 lbs
  Salt 1/2 t Saltpeter 1/2 c Brown Sugar, Packed Or Molasses 1/2 t
  Baking Soda 2 Gals Water
  
  Dissolve the ingredients in 2 gallons water, stir until salt is
  dissolved. Test with an egg; if it floats, fine if not, add more
  salt. Pour over the packed, salted meat and if necessary, pour on
  more water to cover the meat. Invert a dish over itand put a heavy
  weight on it, to be sure that the meat will not float. It maybe used
  in 2 to 3 weeks. For 100 lbs of meat, double all ingredients.

 Categories: Snacks, Fruits
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Fruit puree
 
  Line a cookie sheet (12 x 17 inches) with plastic wrap. This size
  cookie sheet holds approximately 2 cups of puree. Spread puree or
  fruit leather evenly over the plastic but do not push it completely
  to the sides. Leave a bit of plastic showing for easy removal. Place
  on a card table or picnic table in the hot sun to dry. If the plastic
  is bigger than the cookie sheet and extends up the sides, anchor it
  with clothes pins so it will not flop down and cover the edges of the
  leather. Puree should dry in the sun six to eight hours. The heat of
  the sun and the humidity make drying time variable. Puree and fruit
  leather may be dried in an oven set at 140 degrees (F). Too high a
  heat will disintegrate the plastic. Leave the oven door ajar so
  moisture can escape. It takes about six hours in the oven. It can
  also be placed in the back window of a car and dried. Leave the car
  windows open about 1 inch. To make sure the fruit leather is
  completely dried, pull from the plastic wrap or touch to see if the
  fruit leather is "tacky." Purees without sugar will be much drier and
  more brittle. If it is not completely dry it will mold during
  storage. When the fruit leather becomes too dry, it will crack and
  crumble and won't roll, but is still good to eat....call it "fruit
  chips." STORING PUREE AND FRUIT LEATHER Roll fruit leather loosely in
  plastic wrap and store in the cupboard. To store puree without sugar
  for other uses, break it into small pieces and store in plastic bags
  in a dry, cool place or in the freezer. Rose hip powder may be made
  by crushing dried puree with a rolling pin until it is fine enough to
  suit you. This may be stored in small jars in a cool, dry place. It
  is good to sprinkle over cereal and to include in hot cakes and other
  dishes.

 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  ~-------------SOLE FOOD--------------------------------------------
     The into steaks for grilling, or leave it whole for baking or
  poaching. But if confronted by a thin Dover sole when craving fish
  and chips, or a pudgy salmon when you want slivers of gravlax, it's
  good to know how to fillet the fish yourself. While both flatfish and
  roundfish can be filleted, they are approached differently. A
  flatfish is easy to spot; it looks as if it has been run over by some
  underworld tractor. Flatfish swim horizontally along the sea bottom,
  with both eyes facing upward. You can obtain four nearly equal
  fillets from a flatfish, one from either side of the backbone on both
  sides. To fillet a flatfish (sole, flounder, turbot, Pacific
  halibut): Peel it by laying it flat on a counter with the dark side
  up and the tail towards you. Slice off the tail, and insert the tip
  of a knife until you have a grip on the skin. Holding the tail in
  place, pull the skin back towards the head, over the head, and then
  down the light colored side. Lay the fish on the counter with its
  eyes facing up. Cut down the backbone along the center of the fish,
  then hold your knife at an angle at the head end of one fillet. Lift
  the fillet with one hand, while scraping gently with small strokes,
  using the bone structure to guide the knife. Cut away the second
  fillet from the first side. Turn the fish over and repeat the
  process. Roundfish, shaped like a tube, have a center backbone,
  separating two thick fillets. A line of bones extends upward from the
  spine, and a pair of bone creates an oval on the lower side of the
  fish, enclosing the entrails. You can create four fillets, but
  usually one is cut from each side. To fillet: Lay the fish on one
  side, with its tail towards you. Slice along the backbone from head
  to tail, exposing the backbone. Hold a knife parallel to the top
  ribs, cut down the length of the fillet, using short strokes to
  detach it completely. Turn fish around, hold it by the exposed
  backbone, and slice the other half of the fillet free. Flip the fish
  over, and fillet the other side. To skin fillets, lay them skin side
  down, and hold the tail end. Insert the knife at the shallow end and
  scrape along the skin to separate the it from the fillets. Run your
  fingers all along the top of the fillet and feel for pesky little
  bones. They can easily be removed with tweezers, a gesture that will
  be greatly appreciated by all who eat it.

      Title: HOW TO HANDLE PEPPERS
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------PEEL A PECK OF PEPPERS------------------------
 
  Many recipes calling for peppers--sweet bell or fiery chilie--bury the
  elusive line "roasted, peeled, seeded and..." in the ingredient
  listed. There are many ways to accomplish this task. No caveats are
  necessary for sweet bell peppers, but exercise certain precautions in
  handling chilies containing potent oils. Old-fashioned cookbooks call
  for wearing rubber gloves when handling chilies. Instead, cut hot
  chilies on a plate that can be washed in the dishwasher, wash your
  hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling them, and never
  touch your skin until you've washed your hands. And don't handle hot
  chilies under running water, since that spreads the oil vapors upward
  to your eyes. Achieving perfect peppers is a two-part process,
  heating and then cooling them, so the skin separates from the flesh.
  For recipes like pepper salad, in which the peppers should retain
  firmness, it is better to roast and chill them quickly. For recipes
  such as a sauce in which the pepper is pureed, more tender peppers
  are desirable. When roasting hot chilies, make a small slit at the
  stem since they occasionally explode. Here are ways to heat peppers:
  o For a large number of peppers, and to retain the most texture,
  lower peppers gently into 375F oil and fry until the skin blisters.
  Turn them with tongs when one side is blistered, since they will
  float on the surface. This method is also the most effective if
  peppers are not perfectly shaped, since it is difficult to get the
  heat from a broiler into the folds of peppers. Here are other ways to
  heat peppers: o Place the peppers 6 inches from the broiler element
  of the stove, turning them with tongs until all surfaces are charred.
  o Place the peppers 4 inches above a hot charcoal or gas grill, and
  turn them until the skin is charred. o Place a wire cake rack over a
  gas or electric burner. o Set the gas or electric burner at the
  highest temperature, and use tongs to turn the peppers on a wire cake
  rack until all surfaces are charred. o Place the peppers on a rack on
  a cookie sheet in a 550F oven until totally blistered. Only use this
  method for a sauce or other recipe in which the peppers are destined
  to be pureed. For cooling peppers, the options are not as plentiful:
  o Place them in ice water. This stops the cooking action immediately,
  and cools them enough to peel them within a minute. o The alternative
  is to wrap the peppers in a plastic bag and allow them to steam. This
  separates the flesh from the skin, but it will be 20 minutes or more
  before they can be handled. If you wrap peppers in a plastic bag to
  cool, they will soften in the time it takes for them to cool enough
  to be handled. There are no choices to make for the final step: Pull
  the skin off and remove the seeds. The bell can now be rinsed under
  cold water. From Prodigy Cooking Class

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  This is how to prepare your meat for delicious pulled bar-b-que. Beef
  brisket, beef round roasts and pork shoulders and butts may be used If
  cooking the meat in the oven, prehaet to 325. Sprinkle meat with salt
  and pepper to taste. Place in a heavy pot. If you intend to go
  "stovetop" add 1/2 cup water to the pot and cover tightly with BOTH
  foil and a lid. Check meat periodically and add more water as needed.
  If cooking in the oven, DO NOT ADD WATER, just seal and place in the
  oven. For either method, cook approximately 1 hour per pound, or
  until fork tender and falling apart. When meat is done, remove and
  allow to cool. Trim any excess fat. For full pulled meat, pull meat
  into shreds with your hands or two forks. For partially pulled meat,
  pull into 1-inch chunks. Return the shredded meat to the pot and add
  your favorite sauce, allowing 1/2 cup per pound. Cook uncovered over
  low heat. Submitted By SALLI SCHWARTZ (HONN)

 Categories: Main dish, Text file, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Ea	head of  cabbage.
 
  Chapter 1: Preparing the slaw. What makes coleslaw really good is the
  "pickling" of the cabbage. First you slice the cabbage real thin
  layering it in a bowl with a generous amountof salt (you will
  eventually wash all this salt away), then you place the ca hours
  until the cabbage is wilted and well... pickled. My father used to
  place the cabbage directly on top of one of the big refridgerator
  compressor in the back room. Once "pickled" throughly wash to remove
  as much salt as possible.
  
  Chapter 2: Other ingredients
  
  Here are a bunch of suggestions to add variety to your slaw
  
  ~ thinly sliced red or yellow or green onions ~ Red cabbage as well as
  green ~ A good slaw must have grated carrots - bean sprouts
  
  Chapter 3: Dressings
  
  Now for dressings. Mayo is out but there are lots of alternatives
  
  ~ Balsamic or rice vinegar to taste (if you "pickle the cabbage first,
  you'll need less vinegar) ~ Ginger, vinegar and sugar (kind of sweet
  and sour) ~ Vinegar (ginger and sugar) and roasted mustard seed (add
  a nice look and crunch, to roast the mustard seed, heat a heavy
  sautee pan and add the seed to the hot dry pan for about 30 seconds
  to a minute) ~ Vinegar and a good dijon mustard
  
  Remember to let the slaw sit in its dressing for a while before
  serving.
  
  Happy slawing!

      Title: HOW TO MAKE GRAVY
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  ~---------RIDE THE GRAVY TRAIN--------------------------------------
  chicken or a light wine sauce to nap a seared steak, the basis for
  easy and wonderful enrichments for sauteed, fried or roasted dishes
  is what's left sticking to the bottom of the pan. The process of
  turning a messy-looking skillet into an ethereal, richly flavored
  liquid in a matter of minutes is called deglazing. That's because the
  brown bits are caramelized meat juices that escaped while the food
  was cooking. They will meld with the liquid, and can then be
  augmented with anything from salt and pepper to fresh herbs and lemon
  zest. It not only makes a great sauce, it also renders the pan
  virtually clean. The only caveat is to brown the food without burning
  the juices. Even if you start with high heat to sear a piece of meat,
  reduce the heat to medium high so that the juices don't burn. This is
  especially important if you are cooking food in batches. The first
  round of beef cubes might be fine at high heat, but keeping the heat
  there will burn the brown bits as quickly as the tropical sun will
  scorch a fair-skinned person. The first step to deglazing is to
  degrease the pan. If you were pan- frying, pour the grease into a
  measuring cup, and see if any meat juices sink to the bottom. If
  there is a layer, carefully pour off the grease, reserving the liquid
  at the bottom to add to the sauce later. If the food was sauteed,
  there won't be enough juice to worry about, so just dispose of the
  fat. You now have a choice to make. Do you want to saute a chopped
  onion, a few shallots, or a clove or two of garlic as part of your
  sauce? If so, add some fresh butter or oil to the skillet and saute
  the vegetables over medium heat, stirring frequently. The moisture in
  the vegetables will start to coax the brown bits off the bottom of
  the pan. Then add whatever liquid you are using, with the pan over
  medium high heat. Your liquid can be stock, wine, fruit juice, water,
  cream or some combination. The basic amount for a deglazing sauce is
  1/2-to-2/3 cup for a 10- or 12-inch skillet. Raise the heat to high
  and stir the liquid, scraping it all across the bottom of the pan to
  dislodge the brown bits. You want to boil the liquid down rapidly
  until it has reduced in volume by 1/2. It should have an almost
  syrupy consistency. When it has a syrupy consistency, lower the heat
  to low and taste the sauce for seasoning. You can stir in some fresh
  or dried herbs, a bit of salt, if needed, or a few grinds of pepper.

      Title: HOW TO MAKE JERKY
 Categories: Techniques, Preserving, Meats, Dehydrating
      Yield: 1 Technique
 
           Info
 
  Like other dried foods, meat jerky--tough, leathery strips of dried
  meat--was a staple for pioneers and "mountain men" in times past.
  Today, beef jerky is still a favorite among backpackers, skiers and
  campers--and a popular snack for armchair sports fans, too. Modern
  jerky is prepared in an electric dehydrator or oven; sun drying, the
  technique favored in pioneer days, presents too great a risk of
  spoilage or contamination.
  
  Turkey-breast jerky compared to jerky made with trimmed beef flank
  steak, it has less fat.  It also has a more brittle texture, since
  poultry is fairly fibrous.
  
  If you like, you can prepared beef jerky with game instead--but it
  you do, freeze the meat before drying for at least 30 days or at zero
  degrees as a precaution against disease.
  
  The leaner the meat you use for jerky, the better:  a lower fat
  content means a longer shelf life.  As a first step for any jerky,
  trim and discard all visible fat and connective tissue from the meat;
  partially freeze it (to make slicing easier), then cut it into thin
  (1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick) strips about 1 inch wide. Cut with the grain
  if you like a chewy jerky, across the grain if you prefer a more
  tender, brittle product.
  
  Properly dried beef or game jerky should crack, but not break, when
  bent; turkey jerky, however, will crack and break.
  
  Once the jerky has been dried, let it cool; then pack it in a rigid
  freezer container or plastic freezer bag and freeze for 72 hours at
  zero degrees. Then store it in an airtight, insectproof container for
  up to 3 weeks in a cool, dark, dry place.  Or, to maintain flavor and
  prolong shelf life, refrigerate or freeze.

      Title: HOW TO MAKE REAL BELGIAN FRIES!
 Categories: Top secret, Michel mes
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
           AUTHOR="Michel Mes"
 
  Follow these instructions carefully and enjoy the wonderfull taste of
  the real Belgianfries.
  
  Start by peeling some potatoes. Cut them in slices 1 cm (3/8") thick
  and finally cut them into fries of 1 cm square. Dry the fries well in
  paper or a towel before putting them into the oil.
  
  Note: some people like to put them in cold water for a few minutes:
  this washes out much of the starch and tends to make them less sticky
  after the first frying and more crispy after the second.
  
  Heat the oil in a hot frying pan or deep fryer to a temperature of
  160C (320F). Put in a handfull of fries: not more at once because the
  oil will cool down too much. Fry for a few minutes (4-8 depending on
  the thickness and the kind of potatoes), stir regularly to prevent
  sticking. Put the fries into a large bowl with kitchen paper and let
  them 'sweat' for at least 1/2 hour.
  
  Finally heat to 190C (375F) and fry for 2 minutes until crispy and
  golden brown. This way the fries will be crispy on the outside and
  soft on the inside, the way they should be!
  
  Serve with a little salt (no vinegar pleeeeease) and some mayonnaise.
  
  A LIST OF NO-NO'S:
  
  Do not slice them too thin. 1 cm square is the perfect dimension. Try
  to cut them rectangular: pointed ends tend to burn. You'll need more
  patatoes of course.
  
  Do not put in too many fries at once: the oil will cool down and your
  fries will be too wacky and greasy.
  
  Do not fry them the first time until they become brown.
  
  Never put a lid on your frying pan: this makes your fries wacky.
  
  Never use frozen fries! Go to a McDonalds if you like them ... French
  fries (also known as Pommes Allumettes) are thinner then the real
  ones. They taste OK but are a lot more greasy! They are fried only
  once at 180C.
  
  Other variaties include Pommes Paille (1,5 mm thick, fry once) and
  Pommes Gauffre (cut with a special knife).

      Title: HOW TO MAKE TOFU
 Categories: Info/tips, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Daizu (soybeans)
    1/2 ts Nigari (coagulant)
 
  Utensils: 1. A square box (a plastic tofu container with holes poked
  : through the bottom will do).  Line the container with a piece
  : of gauze about four times the size of the box.
   2. Wooden long-handled spoon.
   3. Two-foot-square cotton cloth for straining the "milk" from
  :   the mash.
   4. Blender 5. Large strainer 6. Large mixing bowl 7. Large cooking
  pot
  
  a.  Soak the soybeans in three times the amount of water overnight.
  The
    beans should triple in size. b. When soft, drain off the water
  through a strainer, and pulverize in a
    blender on high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until beans are completely
    pulverized. c. Add 8 ounces of this mixture to 4 quarts boiling
  water. d. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes, stirring
    constantly.  When it starts to boil up again, do not turn down the
    heat but add 2 or 3 drops of vegetable oil - this will keep it from
    boiling over.  Continue to cook another 7-10 minutes. e. Place a
  wire mesh strainer lined with cotton cloth in another bowl and
    pour d. slowly through the lined strainer. f. This separates the
  soybean milk from the mash.  Pick up the corners of
    the cloth and gather and twist tight.  The mixture is still hot, so
    using the long-handled spoon, force the remaining liquid into the
  bowl
    by pressing repeatedly on the twisted cloth.  Be careful to keep a
    tight hold on the ends of the cloth gathered in your hand as you
  twist
    and push with the spoon.  If you drop a corner, very hot liquid can
    spill on you and the okara (soybean mash) will escape.
    (The leftover mash is called "okara".  The soybean milk is called
    "tonyu" and can be refrigerated and drunk for a few days if you
  wish). g. Place the tonyu in a large cooking pot and keep at about
  140 F over
    low heat.  In a separate bowl, mix 5 times the amount of water as
  the
    tonyu with a two-finger pinch of nigari until dissolved. Slowly add
    1/2 to the tonyu, stirring constantly. h. After 5 minutes, add the
  other half of the nigari and water slowly and
    stir.  Cover and reduce to lowest possible heat and let simmer for
    about 15 minutes as the mixture begins to coagulate. i. After
  coagulation, scoop the coagulated tofu out with your wooden
    spoon and evenly fill you lined container.  Wrap the gauze over the
    top and let the container sit for 5 minutes to allow extra liquid to
    drain. j. Immerse the container in a large mixing bowl filled with
  cold water,
    turn it over, gently pull off the container, and remove the gauze.
  
  Making tofu can be an interesting challange, but be careful not to
  burn yourself.  The price of soybeans and nigari is negligible, but
  making tofu does take time and is painstaking. This process has been
  done by hand for centuries, beginning early each morning. Only
  someone who has made their own tofu knows how delicious the rewards
  can be.

      Title: HOW TO MELT CHOCOLATE
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL MELTING:
  
  Follow directions carefully.
  
  Do not overheat; these products scorch easily.
  
  Microwave directions have been tested with microwave ovens ranging
  from 500 to 700 watts (output). Times given are to be considered
  guidelines; microwave ovens differ in timing and heating patterns.
  
  Stirring frequently is important whether using rangetop directions or
  microwave directions. In the microwave oven, chocolate and other
  chips will keep their shape and may not appear melted after heating,
  but will become fluid after stirring.
  
  Handle glass microwave dishes with a hot pad after melting; the
  container may be hotter than the contents.
  
  Wash and dry the melting utensil thoroughly after each use. Any
  residue will affect the taste of the chocolate.
  
  Do not allow chocolate to come in contact with moisture during melting
  since this can cause lumping, tightening or "seizing." If this
  occurs, add one or two tablespoons shortening, such as CRISCO, for
  every six ounces chocolate; stir until fluid.
  
  Do not use butter or margarine since these may contain water. Do not
  use oil since this may prevent the mixture from setting up which is
  especially important if it is being used for a glaze.
  
  Break baking chocolate or candy bars into pieces to speed the melting
  process.

      Title: HOW TO PREPARE FRESH PUMPKIN
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Directions
 
  Break off the pumpkin stem, cut the pumpkin in half crosswise and
  scoop out the seeds and stringy material. Save the seeds for the
  recipe I posted the other day.
  
  Place the halves, cut sides up, on a foil lined baking sheet. Cover
  and seal each half with foil.
  
  Bake in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven until the flesh is very tender,
  about 1 1/2 hours.  Cool until able to handle.
  
  Scoop out the flesh and mash with a potato masher, puree in a blender
  or processor, or push through a fine sieve. If the puree is too
  watery, drain in a colander lined with cheesecloth, folding the
  cheesecloth over the puree and weighing down with a plate. Puree will
  keep up to 5 days in the refrigerator and up to 6 months in the
  freezer.

      Title: HOW TO STIR FRY -  *P COOKING CLASS
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  ~----------WOK AROUND THE CLOCK-------------------------------------
  Spr spatulas toss food high into the air above the pot. Tie a tea
  towel around your head and make noises like a samurai warrior. You'll
  have your family or friends laughing hysterically, but chances are
  you won't be cooking effectively. Speed and control are the keys to a
  successful stir-fry. The ancient Chinese invented stir-frying as one
  of their more than 50 methods of food preparation. However, many
  recipes now use the technique for many non-Asian dishes. It's quick,
  requires little fat, and leaves food with a toothsome texture we
  enjoy today. While it's possible to adapt many recipes to
  stir-frying, oil rather than butter should be used. Dairy solids in
  butter burn at a very low temperature--about 250F--so it can only be
  added as a flavoring agent once food is cooked. Oil, on the other
  hand, doesn't begin to smoke until more than 400 degrees, so it's a
  better choice. Another key principle: Never place too much food in a
  wok or skillet at a time. Food must be able to be seared all over,
  without steaming from being buried under a layer of food. Stir-frying
  itself is a very quick process, so the food must be sitting in bowls
  or dishes placed within arm's reach, ready to be cooked. Cut all the
  pieces the same size, have your seasonings at hand, and make sure
  that any partial cooking of vegetables--such as blanching broccoli or
  carrots--is complete. If your grocery store has a salad bar, it can
  save a lot of preparation time. Go through the salad bar and measure
  out just the ingredients needed for a recipe. Place the wok or
  skillet over a high flame, and heat it very hot. Listen for the sound
  of sizzles. If a few drops of water evaporate immediately, the pan is
  ready. Add the required amount of oil to the pan, and swirl it around
  gently to coat all sides. At this point, it's time to add the food,
  and keep it moving in the pan. If stir-frying in a wok, use a wire
  mesh spoon designed for the job. If stir- frying in a skillet, use a
  spoon that will reach to all places on the bottom, and with which you
  can keep food moving. It's important to add ingredients in the order
  given, and stir constantly. In some recipes, liquid is added and the
  pan is covered for a brief time. In other recipes, it's fry and eat.
  Whatever the method--wok or skillet--you can stir-fry dinner in less
  time than it takes to watch a commercial on the evening news.

      Title: HOW TO USE A BREADMAKER
 Categories: Breadmaker, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           JUDY GARNETT pjxg05a
 
   1. Try using Rapid Rise yeast and check the date on it when you buy
  it. Keep it in the refrigerator and always BRING IT TO ROOM
  TEMP.BEFORE USING IT. I have been using bulk yeast lately because
  it's more economical. I use 2 1/2 level tsp.of the bulk yeast in lieu
  of a pkg of yeast. (This is for the 3 Cup DAK).
  
  2.Use BREAD flour instead of all- purpose flour. It has more gluten.
  If you are using "darker" flours such as rye, whole wheat etc., use
  at least 1 c. white BREAD flour along with the other flours, and try
  using 1 tsp. vital wheat gluten for each cup of flour called for in
  the recipe. At times, I also use a 1 tsp. lecitihin for each cup of
  flour. It helps the elasticity and rise of the bread. If you can't
  find either product, call all your local health food stores. Drug
  Stores often have lecithin near the vitamins.
   3.Check to see that all liquid ingreds. are not too hot or cold.--95
  to 110 degrees is about right. I use a very unscientific method for
  the warm water and milk. I run hot water from the tap and give it the
  "bath water for baby" test on the wrist. <G> Have your other ingreds.
  such as eggs and butter at ROOM temp. If the ingreds. are too hot or
  cold it may kill the yeast.
   4. The key to using the auto- breadmaker is to have the correct
  proportion of flour to liquid. After the dough has kneaded for a few
  minutes in the breadmaker, look in and see if there is ONE ball of
  dough which is incorporating most of the flour from the sides of the
  pan. While it's in its first knead (BEFORE it goes into the
  fermentation and touch the dough lightly. It should be in one soft
  ball. If your finger has sticky dough on it, add a Tablespoon of
  flour. Let it knead a minute and touch it again and check to see if
  it's still sticky. Keep adding a tablespoon at a time ONLY
  
  until it's no longer sticky, DON'T OVERDO IT. It should be a nice
  "soft" ball. If it just makes a slight indentation and doesn't look
  crusty, it's probably about right. If it feels too dry or is in two
  or more balls, OR if the BM seems to be laboring or is "walking", add
  a tablespoon at a time of WARM water. PLEASE DON'T ADD TOO MUCH
  LIQUID. If you add too much liquid in proportion to the flour, the
  dough may rise too much and overflow. (Your bread won't be done in
  the center either) 5.If you look in and see that the dough is
  threatening to rise up over the top of the bread pan, don't panic,
  poke it a few times with a toothpick, skewer, fork,etc. until it
  deflates. 05/31 12:54 pm LOREL

      Title: HRSTULE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      6    Eggs
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Butter
  1 1/2 l  Cooking oil
      1 ts Lemon peel bits
      1 tb Rum
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 lb Flour; blended with...
      3 ts Baking powder
 
  Separate eggs; beat whites until they "peak".  To slightly beaten
  eggs, add sugar and cooled, melted butter; blend until smooth. Add
  the egg whites, lemon peel, rum and vanilla and blend. Add enough
  flour (about 2 pounds) to make a dough that will roll nicely. Roll
  out the dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 5/8 x 6 inch strips.
  
  Over quite hot fire, heat the oil until it stops hissing or
  "speaking". Use a pan to give you an oil depth of about 2 to 2-1/2
  inches. This will allow your hrstule to submerge when you drop it in,
  and whenit rises to the surface, it pretty well indicates readiness
  to turn. Turn and cook both sides a golden brown color. Coat with
  powdered sugar while hot. Twist in various shapes or knot your
  hrstule before droppoing into oil.

    1/2 lb Feta
      3 tb Oilve oil
      1 md Italian pepper
           -- seeded & finely chopped
      1    Pickled green pepper
           -- seeded and chopped
      2 ts Oregano
           Pepper to taste
    1/2    Lemon; strained juice only
           Black olive; for garnish
 
  Htipiti (pronounced h-tee-pee-TEE and translated as "that which is
  beaten") is the name Macedonians gave to this tart feta spread. The
  longer it is beaten, the more tart it will be.
  
  In medium-size bowl, mash feta with fork or potato masher and slowly
  add olive oil, chopped peppers, oregano, and black pepper. Pulverize
  mixture for about 10 minutes (less if using a food processor),
  pouring in lemon juice a little at a time, until feta is creamy.
  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. Yields about 1
  cup.

 Categories: Appetizers, Greek
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Tsouskes
           Oil for frying peppers
      1 lb Feta cheese
      3 tb Oil (olive, what else? K.M.)
 
  Tsouskes are hot spicy peppers.  Of course the best is green long
  peppers which grow only in Macedonia are extremely hot and very tasty.
  
  You fry them in oil, you peel their skin and you chop them into very
  small pieces. How many it depends on how hot they are and how spicy
  you can eat. After, you cut about 1 pound of feta in to small pieces
  and you mix it with the peppers. Add about 3 table spoons of olive
  oil. Work all the ingredients with the fork until it becomes a paste.
  Be careful: I said with fork. Not with food processor, not with
  goudhi. Just FORK. :)
  
  You are all set. Enjoy with bread or crackers as appetizer.

      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Lime juice
      2 lb Tomato
    1/4 c  Olive oil

      3 tb Olive oil
 
  Slice the onions finely.  Peel and slice the garlic. Cut the
  jalapeos into strips.  Set them all aside.
  
  Clean the fish, leaving the head and tail on.  Prick the fish on both
  sides with a coarse-tined fork, rub in the salt and lime juice, and
  set aside in the dish to season for about two hours.
  
  Skin, seed, and chop the tomatoes roughly.  Set them aside.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the onion and garlic, without browning, until
  they are soft.  Add the tomatoes, with the bay leaf, oregano, olives,
  capers, jalapeos, and salt to the pan and cook the sauce over a
  brisk flame until it is well seasoned and some of the juice has
  evaporated--about ten minutes.  Pour the sauce over the fish.
  
  Sprinkle the olive oil over the sauce and bake the fish for about
  twenty minutes, uncovered, on one side. Turn the fish over and
  continue baking it until it is just tender--about 30 minutes. Baste
  the fish frequently with the sauce during the cooking time.

      Title: HUBBARD SQUASH FLAN
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Cooked winter squash puree
      1 ts Salt
  2 1/2 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Semolina
    1/3 c  Cornmeal
      2 ts Butter
      5    Eggs; beaten
      2 tb Molasses
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 md Onion
      1 tb Butter
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/4 c  Walnut pieces, small
  1 1/2 oz Roquefort cheese; crumbled
 
  If blue Hubbard squash is not around your neighborhood, look for
  Tahitian squash, Kabocha, buttercup, or any of the very sweet and
  flavorful winter squashes. To cook any winter squash into a puree,
  seed and peel it and cut the flesh into pieces. Simmer the squash in
  a heavy-bottomed pot with about 1 inch of water and a little salt,
  tightly covered, until it is falling apart. Lift the lid and give it
  a stir now and then, adding a little water if necessary. When the
  squash is completely tender, remove the lid, raise th heat, and stir
  constantly as you cook away all the excess moisture. Then mash the
  pulp with a potato masher or puree it in a food processor. The
  finished puree should have the consistency of a thick applesauce.
  Another method is to roast squash in the oven.
  
  Heat the milk in a medium-sized saucepan and whisk in the semoline,
  cornmeal, and 2 teaspoons of butter. Continue stirring with a whisk
  or a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens, then remove it from the
  heat, let it cool for about 5 minutes, and whisk in the beaten eggs a
  little at a time.
  
  Stir in the squash puree, the molasses, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, nutmeg,
  and cinnamon. Whisk all this together or process it in a blender for
  a few seconds--the mixture should be silky smooth, with no lumps.
  Taste, and add more salt if needed.
  
  Peel and quarter the onion and slice it rather thickly. Saute the
  onion in a tablespoon of butter with the ginger and a dash of salt
  until it begins to color. Lower the heat and keep cooking the onion
  until it is an even caramel color.
  
  Stir the walnut pieces and the crumbled cheese gently into the squash
  mixture; the cheese should not get too mushy and blend into the
  custard, but rather should stay in distinct lumps. Pour the mixture
  into a large, shallow buttered baking dish, and scatter the sauteed
  onions over the top. Put the flan into a pre-heated 400 degree oven;
  after 10 minutes, lower the heat to 350 degrees and bake for 40-45
  minutes more.
  
  Serve the flan hot or warm, with some Chipotle Sauce on the side.

  cut side down, in a shallow baking dish large enough to hold the
  squash in a single layer. Pour in the water. Bake, covered for 30
  minutes. Remove dish from oven, turn squash over and cool. Use a
  spoon to remove the flesh. Cut into 2-inch cubes. Place squash in a
  bowl, drizzle with brandy, sprinkle with sugar and set aside for 30
  minutes to macerate.
  
  In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix in
  the butter, working with your fingers until the mixture holds
  together and is crumbly. Stir in the chopped almonds and the crushed
  amaretti cookies. Set aside.
  
  Place squash and juice in a 12-inch round baking dish. Spread the
  almond mixture evenly over them. Bake for 1 hour, or until the squash
  is bubbling and the topping is golden brown. To serve, scoop hot
  crisp into individual dessert bowls and drizzle with chilled heavy
  cream.

 Categories: Cyberealm, Kooknet, Jewish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           About 12 raw eggs in shells
           Water
           Skins from several onions
    1/4 c  Oil, approximately
 
  Put the eggs in one layer of a large pot, and cover them with several
  inches of cool water. If desired, add the onion skins to the water to
  tint the shells brown and subtly flavor the eggs. (Onion skins are
  not necessary to tint the egg albumen brown. This happens because of
  the long cooking.) Pour the oil on top of the water; it helps keep
  the water from evaporating during the extended cooking process.
  Slowly bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat; then cover
  the pot tightly and lower the heat so the eggs simmer very gently.
  Simmer them on top of the stove, or place the pot in a 225F oven, and
  cook for at least 8 hours or overnight. Serve the eggs warm, at room
  temperature, or chilled. They may be reheated by boiling them for 3-5
  minutes.

      4 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese

           - have been rinsed

      1 ts Salt; or to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
      6 c  Purchased or homemade salsa,
           - warmed
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch oven-proof glass or
  earthenware casserole dish. Make an incision along the length of each
  bell pepper and remove the stem, seeds and membranes, keeping the
  peppers whole. Fill a medium-size saucepan or skillet halfway with
  water and bring it to a boil. Add the peppers, let the water return
  to a boil and cook until the peppers are just softened, about 3
  minutes. Remove and blot them very dry with paper towels. Let them
  cool completely and then line the bottom of the casserole with them.
  Separate the eggs into 2 large bowls. Beat the yolks until smooth,
  then stir in the cheese, corn, milk, jalapeno peppers and salt and
  black pepper. Whisk the whites until soft peaks form, then fold them
  into the yolk mixture, gently stirring just until almost blended.
  Scrape the mixture into the prepared dish and transfer it to the
  middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake just until the eggs are puffy
  and the top is lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to
  325F and continue cooking until the eggs are baked through but not
  dry, 22 to 25 minutes. Test by inserting a knife into the center. It
  should come out almost clean. Remove the pan and let it sit for a few
  minutes before cutting the casserole into 12 rectangles. Serve each
  portion with some salsa spooned on top.

    1/4 ts Cumin, ground
      2 ts Chili powder
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  1. Preheat the oven to 400 deg. To make the omelet, drain and crumble
  the tofu. Place the tofu, soymilk, and salt into a blender and blend
  until smooth. Stir in the green onion. Lightly oil two 9-inch pie
  pans, preferably glass. Divide the omelet mixture between the pans,
  smooth out the top with a spatula, and bake for about 35 minutes. The
  edges will become brown, the top will become golden and the tofu will
  have the texture of an omelet. When the omelets are cooked, loosen
  them from the pie pans with a sharp spatula and cut them in half.
  
  2. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add all the ingredients and cook,
  covered, over medium heat for 5 minutes. Uncover and cook another 5
  minutes.
  
  3. Place half of the omelet on each plate and cover with the Ranchero
  sauce.

  Remove stalks and seeds from chilis and chop finely (take care in
  handling them).  Blend into fenugreek paste with salt to taste and
  place in a pot. This is the actual Hulba.
  
  Add remaining ingredients except the stock or substitute some of the
  ingredients with whatever is on hand, e.g. diced boiled potatoes for
  rice, cooked dried beans for lentils. (For 1 cup cooked lentils,
  simmer 1/2 cup red lentils in 1-1/2 cups water for 15-20 minutes
  until thick.)
  
  Blend ingredients in pot and add enough stock to moisten. Place over
  medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until bubbling and
  thick. Add a little more stock during heating if necessary.
  
  Adjust seasoning with salt and serve in a deep bowl with khobz,
  malvj, or the readily available Lebanese flat bread for scooping up
  the mixture. Serve in individual bowls if preferred.

 Categories: Poultry, Grill, Hawaii
      Yield: 4 Servings

      Title: HULLED CORN SOUP (AI)
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables, Side dish, Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 qt Dried Indian corn kernels
      3 lb Salt pork
      1 lb Dry red kidney beans
      1 qt Hardwood ashes
 
  Put enough water in an old kettle to cover the corn, Bring to a boil;
  add corn and ashes. Cook about 20 minutes, stirring frequently. This
  loosens the hulls or shells on the corn. When the hulls slip off the
  kernels by working between the fingers, drain the water and rinse
  corn in cold water, working corn with the fingers to help remove
  hulls. Drain and parboil; drain, rinse and parboil again. Repeat
  several times until the parboiled water looks clean and clear, (A
  handmade basket is traditionally used for this purpose.)
  
  When corn is good and clean, place it in a large kettle or canner with
  clean water. Parboil washed beans separately until water is colored;
  add both water and beans to the corn mixture. Cut salt pork into
  small pieces; add to the corn and beans. Be sure to use plenty of
  water because the corn will swell as it cooks. Cook 3 or 4 hours, or
  until corn is tender, stirring occasionally and adding water as
  needed. Makes 16 quarts of soup.

    1/3 c  Water
    1/4 c  Olive Oil
      6 tb Lemon Juice

           Drained
    1/2 ts Ground Cumin
      1 ts Coriander Seeds
           Salt -- to taste
 
  Combine first five ingredients in food processor and blend until
  smooth. Add chickpeas and seasonings and blend to puree. Taste and
  adjust flavors to suit (I usually like a little more lemon.).
  
  The mixture you get before adding the chickpeas is also delicious,
  although extremely strong in garlic
  :>).  Use a bit less garlic, thin with water and you've got a
  delicious salad dressing.  Unfortunately, a very high fat salad
  dressing, though.

      Title: HUMMUS (MANTON)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Mashed/pureed chickpeas
           (+/-)
      2 tb Tahini (optional, sort of)
      4    To 5 cloves crushed/chopped
           Garlic
        x  Lemon juice to taste
           (depending on how sour you
           Like it)
 
  Everyone has their own preference for the particular formula of
  tahini/garlic/lemonjuice...you'll have to experiment to find your
  perfect blend.
  
  Mash/blend everything all up together, then scoop up/eat with strips
  of fresh pita bread, celery, green pepper, carrot, zucchini,
  whathaveyou.
  
  You *can* make it without the tahini, but it doesn't taste nearly as
  good. you can keep the tahini down to a minimum, and add extra garlic
  and lemon juice for flavor...you can also put the tahini in a cup to
  sit for awhile, until the oil separates and floats to the top. you
  can then skim off the oil and use the remaining nut butter in the
  recipe. it will still contain some oil and fat, but not as much. you
  may need to mix a little water or lemon juice into the tahini to
  liquify it a bit before mixing it into the chickpea mash.

      Title: HUMMUS BI TAHINI (CHICK PEA & SESAME PUREE)
 Categories: Dips, Condiments, Greek
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Chick peas
      3 c  Water
    1/3 c  Tahini
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
      2    Cloves garlic; crushed
           Salt

MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
           Parsley; chopped
      1 tb Olive oil
           Paprika or cayenne pepper
 
  1. Wash chick peas well, cover with the water and soak for 12 hours or
  overnight. 2. Boil gently for 2 hours in the water in which they were
  soaked, add 1 teaspoon salt and cook until very tender, about 3 hours
  in all. Drain and reserve some of the cooking liquid and 1 tablespoon
  of the peas. 3. Press peas through a sieve or food mill, adding about
  2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid to separate the last of the peas
  from the skins. 4. Slowly blend the tahini and most of the lemon
  juice into the puree. 5. Crush garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a
  mortar and add to puree. Adjust flavour and consistency with lemon
  juice or cooking liquid and add salt if necessary. Hummus should be
  thick and smooth. 6. Spread in a shallow serving dish, swirling it
  with back of a spoon. Pour olive oil in centre and garnish with
  reserved chick peas, chopped parsley and a sprinkling of paprika or
  cayenne pepper. Makes 3 cups. Cooking time: 3 hours Blender or food
  processor method: Puree peas to separate skins, add to container or
  processor bowl with remaining ingredients, holding back some lemon
  juice and salt to adjust flavour. Blend or process until thick and
  smooth. Note: Even if using a modern appliance the chick peas must be
  separated from their skins for a successful hummus.
  
  Preparation time can be shortened by removing the skins either after
  the initial soaking, or after boiling.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    To 3 medium cloves garlic,
           Sliced [I use more, but I
           Love garlic!]
      1    Large handful parsley
      2    Healthy scallions, in 1-inch
           Pieces
      3 c  Cooked chick-peas
      6 tb Tahini  [First I cut down to
           One, now I just use a few
        dr Chinese
           Sesame oil]
      6 tb Fresh lemon juice [I use
           Quite a lot more - one or
           Two whole lemons,
           Squeezed]
    3/4    To 1 tsp. salt (to taste)
      1    Cayenne and a little cumin,
           To taste [she says optional,
           But I don't!]
 
  1) Place garlic, parsley and scallions in a food processor or
  blender, and mince.
  
  2) Add chick peas, tahini [or oil], lemon juice, and salt, and puree
  to a thick paste. [I grind the chick peas separately first, it makes
  life much easier].
  
  3) Season to taste with cayenne and cumin. Transfer to a tightly
  lidded container and chill.
  
  The green colour can be a bit disconcerting at first, and it does
  taste a bit different, using sesame oil instead of tahini. But it is
  still good, I feel.

      2 tb Wheat flour
           -Paprika, freshly ground
           -black pepper
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  In a saucepan, add the couscous and water. Bring to a boil, then
  reduce the heat and cover. Cook until all the water is gone, about 10
  minutes. Then turn off the heat.
  
  While the couscous is cooking, saute the vegetables. On a large
  saucepan, spray the olive oil on the pan or brush with a pastry
  brush. Add the water and heat over moderate heat until the water
  starts to simmer. Add the eggplant strips, carrots, garlic, salt and
  pepper. Saute until soft, adding a little more water if too dry. Then
  turn off the heat.
  
  In a mixing bowl or blender, mix the chickpeas, tahini paste, lemon
  juice, and vegetable broth. Using a hand blender or blender, blend
  into a smooth paste. Then add the egg replacer or potato starch, and
  the flour. Blend until smooth.
  
  With the heat turned off on the large saucepan, add the chickpea
  (hummus) mixture to the vegetables and coat well. Then add the
  couscous and mix the vegetable/hummus mixture into the couscous.
  
  Lightly grease a glass bread loaf pan with olive oil. Add the
  couscous/vegetable/hummus mixture. Press into the loaf pan. Dust the
  top of the loaf with paprika and black pepper.
  
  Bake 50-55 minutes. Let stand 10-15 minutes before serving. Serve in
  thick slices with a green vegetable such as cooked spinach, a salad
  such as lettuce topped with fresh orange slices, and if desired, a
  bread such as warm whole-wheat pita bread. - Mary Howard

 Categories: Appetizers, Greek
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Dried chick-peas
    1/4 ts Baking soda

    1/4 c  Olive oil
      2    Garlic cloves
    1/2 ts Ground coriander (optional)
    1/2 ts Ground cumin (optional)
           Salt & freshly ground pepper

  Wash the chick-peas, then soak overnight with the baking soda in cold
  water to cover.  The following day, drain and wash the chick-peas,
  then cover with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and
  simmer until tender, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.  Drain and push through sieve
  or food mill, discarding the coarse fibers remaining in the sieve.
  Meanwhile, put the tahini in a small bowl and beat it with the 1/3
  cup water until dissolved, using a whisk or fork.  Beating briskly
  with the whisk, add the tahini mixture, a teaspoonful at a time, to
  the chick-peas, alternating with the lemon juice and olive oil.  When
  all has been added, crush the garlic over the mixture and sprinkle
  with optional spices, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon chopped parsley.
  Beat for another minute, then taste for seasonings and chill
  overnight - if possible. Serve cold, sprinkled with additional
  chopped parsley. Makes about 2 cups.

MMMMM----------------------SCALLION BRUSHES---------------------------
      1 bn Scallions
           Ice water
 
  Using wet, hot towels, moisten the bean curd skin sheets and set aside
  until ready to use. Cover with hot towels to retain the moisture. In
  separate small bowls, cover the dried shrimp and mushrooms with a
  little boiling water. When soft, drain and mince finely with a knife
  or cleaver. Mince the ginger. Finely chop scallions. In 1 tablespoon
  oil, stir-fry the minced shrimp, mushrooms and bamboo shoot, adding 1
  tablespoon of the soy sauce, the sherry, sugar, flavor enhancer and
  black pep- per to taste. After a minute, when most of the liquid has
  evaporated, stir in the scallions and remove the filling to a
  container to cool.
  
  In a large, flat, rectangular pan, combine chicken stock and
  remaining soy sauce. Dip a softened bean curd sheet into stock
  mixture and lay out flat on a work surface. Sprinkle lightly with
  filling.
  
  Repeat dipping process with a second bean curd sheet, laying it on
  top of the first and sprinkling it with a little filling. Cover with
  a third sheet which has been dipped in the stock but do not sprinkle
  with filling. Make sure all the corners of the bean curd skin package
  are thoroughly moistened and gently fold into a 7x5-inch shape. Set
  aside. Make a batter by combining the eggs with a little water and
  beating. Stirring vigorously, pour the egg mixture into the flour.
  The resulting batter should have the consistency of heavy cream. Add
  more water if necessary. Heat oil for deep-frying in a wok to 300 F.
  Moisten the whole pie with the egg batter and gently slip into the
  hot oil. Increase the heat and cook, turning occasionally and gently,
  until the pie is golden brown on both sides.
  
  The pie may form pockets of air in the center and puff up. If this
  happens while you are cooking it, prick them with the point of a
  sharp pin. Drain well and cut in 8 to 10 rect- angular pieces. Serve
  wrapped in a PANCAKE with SAUCE and a SCALLION BRUSH and garnish with
  parsley and decorative radishes.
  
  PANCAKES: Pour the boiling water into the flour and mix well with
  chopsticks. Gather the dough into a ball and on a well-floured
  surface, knead about 10 minutes until dough is smooth and satiny. Set
  aside, cover with a damp cloth and let rest about 15 minutes. After
  resting, roll dough into a cylandrical shape about 1-1/2 inches in
  diameter. Cut crosswise into 12 rounds. Lightly brush some oil on one
  side of each piece.
  
  Place two pieces together with the oiled sides together, resembling a
  little sandwich. Roll each sandwich into a 6 to 7-inch circle. Cook
  the dough circles one at a time on an ungreased skillet over low heat
  1 minute, then turn over. When very lightly browned, remove from heat
  and carefully separate into individual pancakes. Serve immediately or
  reheat by heating them over a small quantity of water.
  
  SAUCE: Combine all ingredients and serve as a sauce for the vegetable
  pie or for Peking Duck.
  
  SCALLION BRUSHES: Trim off root ends of scallions. Cut 2-3-inch
  pieces off lower white end. Using the point of a small, thin, sharp
  knife, score the white ends in 1-inch cuts, cutting away from the
  greens. Evenly space 5-8 cuts a- round the circumference of each
  stalk, so that the ends may open out. When cut, drop in ice water
  until the ends curl.

  mixture and beat until the batter is silky smooth. Fill a greased 8
  inch kugelhopf pan ( turks head mold )and let the mixture rise ,
  covered with a towel about 1 inch from the top of the pan which
  should take 1 1/2 hours. Bake cake at 450 for 20 minutes ( this cause
  the characteristic brown top crust ) and then reduce heat to 350 and
  bake the cake until done, maybe another 30 minutes or tested done.

      Title: HUNGARIAN CALFS LIVER W/ONIONS & VINEGAR SA
 Categories: Beef, Hungary
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Calfs liver
           Sliced white or yellow
           -onion (One for every
           -two people eating)
           Imported Sweet Paprika
           Salt and Pepper
           Flour
           Butter
           Good vinegar red or white
 
  Mention calfs liver and a lot of people make strange faces. Serve
  Hungarian style calfs liver that was dipped in pakrika, and sauted in
  butter along with thinly sliced onions and then smothered in vinegar
  to make a most unusual but succulent dish. Serve with mashed potatos
  or cooked rice and you have heaven on earth.
  
  Regards, June Meyer.
  
  Depending on how much liver you are making, slice liver into finger
  sized strips. Season liver with very liberal sprinkling of paprika.
  Season with salt and pepper. Dredge strips in flour. Let rest while
  you thinly slice onions. Melt butter in frying pan and saute onions.
  When onions are almost cooked, toss in the liver strips and saute
  along with the onions. The liver will only take a few minutes to
  cook. When they are done, sprinkle about 1/2 tsp. paprika over the
  onions and mix in a good Tbls. vinegar to make a thick onion gravy.
  Serve when ready.

  There is no soup as good as the soup Mama made when you were young.
  
  Regards, June Meyer. Cook chicken in pot with water, skiming the scum
  off when starting soup to boil. Place all the vegetables and spices
  in the pot. Cook under a low flame until the chicken is tender.
  Remove as much fat as possible. Strain soup and serve with broad
  noodles or LIVER DUMPLINGS. Eat chicken on the side with TOMATO SAUCE
  or DILL SAUCE.

  for this. Drop into boiling water by the 1/2 teaspoonsful. Cook about
  15 minutes or until done. If batter is too thick you can add a little
  water. Drain and serve with soup. Serves a family.

 Categories: Cookies, Chocolate, Hungarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      4 lg Eggs, separated
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
    2/3 c  Sugar, divided
    3/4 c  Sweet butter, room temp.
      9 tb Cocoa powder
    1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 c  Heavy cream
     12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate chips
      1 tb Powdered instant coffee
    1/8 c  Rum

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      5 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      4 tb Sweet butter
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      1 tb Karo syrup
 
   Of all my recipes, this is the only one that I have never given
  out-its raves convinced me in earlier years to keep it only as my
  own. It is singularly the best chocolate dessert I have ever tasted!
  
   Editor's Note: This recipe contains rum. If you prefer not to use
  rum, the brownies still taste fantastic.
  
   To make cake: preheat oven to 350. Grease 9 x 13-inch pan. Line pan
  with wax paper and grease the wax paper.
  
   Beat the egg whites lightly, add cream of tartar and beat at a high
  speed. When shiny, gradually add 1/3 cup of sugar, continuing to beat
  until stiff.
  
   In a separate mixing bowl, place the egg yolks, remaining sugar and
  butter and beat until light and fluffy. Add the cocoa and mix
  thoroughly. Add a large dollop of egg whites to chocolate mixture and
  whip until blended. Then pour the rest of the egg whites over the egg
  mixture and sprinkle the flour over the egg whites. Fold gently with
  a spatula until the egg whites and flour are incorporated.
  
   Immediately spread the batter in the prepared pan. Smooth out to
  edges and corners. Bake 10-15 minutes at 350 until cake is done. Run
  a knife around edges and invert cake on a wire rack to cool.
  
   To make filling: in a saucepan, combine cream, chocolate chips and
  instant coffee. Cook over low heat until mixture is smooth and
  slightly thickened. Cover saucepan and refrigerate until very cold.
  When chilled, add rum and whip in a chilled bowl at medium speed
  until firm. Be careful not to over beat or the filling may separate.
  
   To make glaze (do not make this until all other steps are
  completed): in a small saucepan, melt all ingredients over a low
  flame. Mix until very smooth. Cool for 15 minutes and mix again. Use
  immediately, as the sauce thickens as it cools.
  
   To assemble, cut cake horizontally into halves. Lightly sprinkle

      Title: HUNGARIAN CHRISTMAS BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Hungarian
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 ts Sugar
    2/3 c  Warm water
      1 c  Butter, at room temperature
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Grated lemon peel
    1/4 c  Nonfat dry milk
  2 1/2    To 3-1/2 cups unbleached
           -flour
      1 c  Ground poppy seeds
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Milk
           GLAZE:
      1    Egg beaten with 1 tsp wat
 
  In a small cup, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water. Let stand
  for a few minutes.  Meanwhile, combine the butter, sugar, salt, 1
  tbsp lemon peel, and milk in a large mixing bowl. Then add 2-1/2 cups
  of flour alternately with the yeast mixture.  Blend the dough well.
  Turn the dough out onto a floured board. Knead for about 10 minutes
  until the dough is smooth and not sticky. Add more flour as
  necessary. Put the dough into a greased bowl, turning so the top is
  greased. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk,
  about 1 hour. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Combine
  the poppy seeds, sugar,raisins, milk, and the rest of the lemon peel
  in the top half of a double boiler. Cook it over hot water until the
  mixture is of spreading consistency. Stir constantly. It should
  thicken in about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room
  temperature.  Punch the dough down,divide in half, and roll each
  piece into a long rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the filling
  on top of each piece, then roll up. Pinch the seams together so the
  filling can't come out.  Place the rolls on a large greased baking
  sheet and brush with the glaze.  Cover the rolls with wax paper laid
  across water glasses so the paper doesn't touch the dough.  Let rise
  again for 30 minutes. Apply a second coat of glaze. Bake the loaves
  in a preheated 325 F oven for about an hour.  If the top browns too
  rapidly, cover loosely with aluminum foil. Cool on a wire rack. Makes
  2 loaves.

      2 ts Dried marjoram
      1 ts Caraway seeds
      1 ts Lemon zest
      1 cl Garlic
    3/4 c  Butter
      1 tb Tomato paste
      1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
      2 lb Onions, sliced
      1 c  Water
      2 lb Beef (rump, round or chuck)
           -lamb or veal is nice too
      1 c  Sweet red and green pepper
           -chunks (or peppers of your
           -choice)
           Salt to taste
 
  Crush together the marjoram, caraway, garlic and lemon zest.
  
  In a large kettle, combine the butter (or fat of your choice), 1 tb.
  tomato paste, the crushed seasonings and the sliced onions. Saute the
  onions, stirring all the while, until the onions are golden. Add the
  paprika, stir and saute 30 seconds longer. Add the beef, lamb or
  veal, (cut in uniform chunks), the water and salt to taste. Cover the
  kettle tightly and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is
  tender. Add a bit more water during cooking, only if it is necessary.
  Just before the goulasch is done, add 1/2 cup more water and let the
  sauce boil up once more. If more sauce is preferred, sprinkle it with
  1/4 cup flour just before the water is added at the end and add 1
  more cup of water.
  
  Serve the goulasch with speaetzle, noodles or boiled potatoes. Our
  personal preferance (and one that is commonly used in Vienna) is
  zemmel knoedle (kaiser roll dumplings.)
  
  In Hungary, slivered grteen peppers are sprinkled on this gulyas. It
  may also be sprinkle with bits of sweet red pepper.

  Soup Body
  
  Saute the onion in fat until golden.  Add the beef and stir until well
  browned.  Add salt, paprika, and tomatoes, and let simmer (adding a
  little water to prevent over-browning) for 30 minutes. Sprinkle the
  flour over the meat, stir, and pour enough water to cover the meat
  well. Add carrot, parsnip, green pepper, and bring to a boil. Turn to
  low heat and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add potatoes and more water (to
  soup consistency). Salt to taste.  Simmer until potatoes and meat are
  well cooked.
  
  Pinched Noodles
  
  Combine ingredients with enough flour to make a medioum dough. Drop
  tiny noodles from a spoon into simmering soup. When the noodles float
  to the surface, they are done.  A good alternative to the spoon is to
  put the dough on a cutting board, use a flat edged knife to cut off a
  portion of the dough, roll the portion along the length of the board
  (producing a length like a piece of licorice) and then cut of 0.75
  inch pieces to drop in the soup.  Note that this can be done right
  over the pot.
  
  Add "pinched noodles" and boil a few minutes longer with the chopped
  parsley.  Do not add to many noodles as they are there only to add a
  different flavour and consistency (versus the intent to bulk up the
  soup). Serve in a deep bowl.

  Add the chopped onion to the bacon fat in the skillet, or Dutch oven
  and cook over medium heat until the onion is transparent, stirring
  occasionally.  Remove the onion with a slotted spoon to the bowl
  containing the bacon and set aside.
  
  Add the meat to the bacon fat and slowly brown on all sides, stirring
  occasionally.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon paprika, salt, pepper, and the
  marjoram over the meat mixture.
  
  Stir in the bacon-onion mixture with the chopped green or red pepper.
  Slowly pour in the meat broth and white wine. Bring to boiling. Reduce
  heat, cover and simmer 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender
  when pierced with a fork.  Remove the meat with a slotted spoon to a
  heavy serving dish.
  
  Thicken the cooking liquid by pouring 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup flour
  into a screw top jar.  Shake until the mixture is well blended.
  Slowly pour one half of the mixture into the sauce pot, stirring
  constantly. Bring to boiling.  Gradually add only what is needed of
  the remaining flour-water mixture for consistency desired. Bring to
  boiling after each addition. Cook 3 to 5 minutes longer.
  
  In a small skillet melt 1 tablespoon butter (or more). Remove from
  heat. Blend in 1/2 teaspoon paprika.  Stir in 1 tablespoon water.
  Immediately add to liquid in the skillet/and/or/Dutch oven, stirring
  untill well blended. Pour the sauce over the meat.  Serve immediately.
  
  Note 1.  Both Germans and Hungarians serve the Gulyas with Spaetzle
  dumplings.
  
  Note 2:  You can add any of the following to the receipe.
  
        1    teaspoon caraway seed
        1    clove garlic, minced 6 medium potatoes, washed, pared, and

  The combination of cabbage & noodles pleases the palate. In preparing
  this dish, I recommend sauteeing the cabbage & onions, separately.
  This method brings out the flavor of each food.
  
  Saute the cabbage in 1 tbsp of corn oil about 15 minutes. Set aside.
  In a separate pan, saute onions and garlic, along with the salt,
  pepper and paprika in the remaining corn oil. Cook until the onions
  are translucent . Stir the onions and cabbage together. Add the
  cooked noodles and reheat. Serve hot, garnished with parsley.

   This legacy from my Hungarian grandmother links my children to their
  Old World heritage in a most pleasing way! No one can eat only one of
  these rich little crescents. Make sure you let the dough chill
  overnight to make it easy to work with.
  
   Editor's Note: You may want to cut recipe in half for a smaller
  yield.
  
   In a bowl, cut the butter and shortening into the flour until the
  mixture is crumbly. In a separate bowl, mix the yeast into sour
  cream, then add egg yolks and salt. Combine with the flour mixture.
  Mix until smooth and the sides of the bowl are clean.
  
   Form into a large ball and chill, covered, overnight.
  
   To make filling, mix walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and stiffly
  beaten egg whites together in a bowl. To make egg wash mix egg yolk
  and few drops of water in a small bowl.
  
   Preheat oven to 350. Sprinkle granulated sugar onto a pastry board.
  Divide the dough into six portions. Work with one portion at a time,
  refrigerating the dough you are not using. Roll out the dough to
  1/8-inch thick and sprinkle with more sugar. Cut into 2 x 2-inch
  squares. Place a bit of the nut filling along one end of the square
  and roll up. Form into a crescent. Place seam side down on a greased
  cookie sheet. Paint with egg wash. Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes.
  Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.

      3 tb Hungarian paprika
      1 ts Saltpeter
    1/4 ts Cloves, ground
      1    Sausage casing, 1" diameter
           -- 10 feet
 
      In a meat grinder, coarsely grind the pork, beef, and pork fat, in
  batches. Add all remaining ingredients, except the casings. Mix well
  and allow to sit while you clean the casings.
      Rinse the casings thoroughly in cold water and run fresh water
  through them. Drain.
      Using a sausage machine, a KitchenAid with a sausage attatchment,
  or a sausage funnel, fill the casings and tie them off into about 16"
  lengths. Do not fill them too tightly as they must have room to
  expand when they cook.
      Hang the sausages in a home style smoker and smoke them for abour
  1 hour. Do not allow the temperature of the smoker to go above 150 F.
      Remove the sausages and hang over a stick or dowel. Put the stick
  in a cool place and position an electric fan so that it will blow
  directly on the sausages. Allow them to dry for 2 days. They are they
  ready for use.
      Place them in the refrigerator, where they will keep well for
  about a week.

  Recipe by: LASZLO REPAS (MBSB94A) * ( cook 5 heads of cleaned and
  crushed garlic in 2 cups of water). There are many variation to the
  Hungarian Sausage, different regions have their own recipes and
  tastes. The following is the one I make, you can make some changes to
  suit your taste. The onions and hot peppers are optional. I use them,
  but many people do not.
  
  Grind meat with onions into a large pan, Add seasonings and garlic
  water, MIX well (check for salt to taste) Stuff into sausage casings,
  tie both ends of casing. Use it fresh, it should last in the
  refrigerator for about one week. We freeze some of it in serving size
  portions, in large plastic zip lock bags. We also smoke part of it.
  
  We cook the fresh kolbasz in a covered casserole pan, cover it with
  water cook until all water is gone, uncover and fry to brown on both
  sides. I am sure you will find other methods to cook and enjoy

  Heat the lard in a Dutch oven or deep, heavy saucepan and add the
  onion. Cook, stirring, until wilted. Add the veal and stir. Cook,
  stirring often, until the veal looses its red color. Sprinkle with
  the paprika and stir. Cook for 5 minutes and sprinkle with garlic,
  salt and pepper to taste. Stir briefly and sprinkle with flour. Stir
  to coat the pieces of meat and add the chicken broth. Bring to a
  boil. Cover with round of wax paper and put the lid on. Place in the
  oven and bake from 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Cooking time will depend on the
  quality of the veal. Best quality veal cooks more rapidly than that
  of a lesser quality. Pork cooks very quickly. Meanwhile, drop the
  green pepper strips into boiling water and blanch for ab. 15 seconds.

  fully cooked, sprinkle with the pepper strips. Continue cooking until
  veal is tender. If desired, add the sour cream. preferably, it should
  be beaten with a whisk before adding and stirred in gradually. Serve
  the stew, if desired, with spaetzli. Yield: 8 or more servings

  still asleep, but you can use your judgement. (He tends to like his
  potatoes mushy, so the times listed may be all right for your family.)

 Categories: Middle east, Turkish, Vegetables, Eggplant, Time/life
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
      4 sm Eggplant; (about 1/2 lb. or
           ;2 md. (about 1 lb. ea.)
      1 tb Butter
      1 tb Flour

           ;grated or use Romano cheese
    1/2 ts Salt
           Black pepper; freshly grated
 
    First, roast the eggplants in the following fashion: Prick each one
  in 3 or 4 places with the tines of a long handled fork. Then impale
  them, one at a time, on the tines of the fork and turn them over a
  gas flame until the skin chars and begins to crack.  (If you have an
  electric stove, pierce the eggplants, place them on a large baking
  sheet and broil them 4 inches from the heat sseri; freshly
  :          ;grated or use Romano cheese
      1/2 ts Salt
  :          Black pepper; freshly grated
  
    First, roasm, cutting away any badly charred spots on the surface.
  Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise and chop them finely. Then mash
  the pulp to a smooth puree with the back of a spoon or with a mortar
  and pestle.
    In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan, heat the tablespoon of butter over
  moderate heat.  When the foam begins to subside, stir in the flour
  and when it is completely absorbed pour in the milk all at once.
  Stirring vigorously with a whisk, cook over high heat until the
  mixture comes to a boil and thickens heavily. Beat in the pureed
  eggplant, reduce the heat to low, and, stirring occasionally, simmer
  for 5 minutes. Off the heat add the cheese, salt and a few grindings
  of pepper. Beat vigorously until the mixture is thick enough to hold
  its shape almost solidly in the spoon.
   Taste for seasoning and serve at once.  Hunkar begendi traditionally
  accompanies roast or braised veal or lamb.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    250 g  Hunza Apricots
    225 g  Thick plain yogurt, Greek or
           Home made
 
  Hunza apricots are apricots which are dried without preservatives.
  They are therefore brown in colour instead of orange. They have a
  wonderful flavour and a natural sweetness.
  
  Put apricots into a medium sized saucepan and cover generously with
  water. Leave to soak overnight if possible. Then simmer the fruit
  over a gentle heat, without lid on the saucepan until fruit is tender
  and the has reduced to a syrup.
  
  Serve hot or cold, with the yogurt.

 Categories: China, Ham/pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour *
      1 c  Water *
      2 oz Cabbage (1/2 cup cooked and
           - chopped)
    1/2 lb Lean ground pork
      1    Green onion, chopped
      1 ts Chopped ginger
      1 tb Tientsin Preserved Vegetable
           - rinsed and chopped
      2 tb Oil
      1 c  Chicken stock

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONING------------------------------
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Sugar
      1 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Oyster sauce
      1 ts White wine
           Dash of pepper
      2 ts Cornstarch

MMMMM----------------------------DIP---------------------------------
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Hot spiced oil
      1 ts White Vinegar
 
  Combine flour and cold water in large mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly to
  form dough.  Cover with damp cloth; let stand for 20 minutes. *
  
  Cook cabbage 2 minutes in boiling water.  Rinse in cold water, and
  drain. Squeeze dry of all excess moisture. Chop fine; set aside.
  
  Place the ground pork, chopped green onion, chopped ginger, and
  preserved vegetables together on chopping board. Mix and chop with
  the clever for approximately
       15    strokes.
  
  Add "seasoning" and the cabbage to the pork mixture and mix
  thoroughly.
  
  After dough has set for 20 minutes, knead it for 1 minute and then
  form into 2 to 3 rolls, approximately 1-1/2 inch in diameter. Cut
  each roll of dough into slice 1-1/2 inch thick.
  
  With a small rolling pin, or heel of hand, flatten each piece of
  dough into a thin patty, 3 inch in diameter. Place 1/4 tablespoon of
  the pork mixture in the center of each patty. Fold in half, and seal
  the edges by pressing firmly together with your fingers. (Help
  ready-made skins to seal by applying egg white to the edges.)
  
  Set each pot sticker with the straight edge on a platter, pressing
  firmly so as to form a flat base. Each pot sticker should be made to
  stand upright, rather than allowed to rest flat on its side.
  
  Heat frying pan and add 2 tablespoon oil.  On medium heat, pan-fry pot
  stickers.  Cook on the base surface only. Pan-fry 2 minutes, until
  the base side is nicely browned.
  
  Add 1 cup chicken stock to the pot stickers.  Cover and cook over
  medium heat for approximately 7 minutes, until most of the chicken
  stock is absorbed.  Remove to platter.
  
  Mix thin soy sauce, hot spiced oil, and white vinegar to use as
  condiment for Pot Stickers.
  
  * Pot sticker skins can be purchased at Chinese groceries.

      Title: HURRY TUNA~ PLEASE
 Categories: Casseroles, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -----INGREDIENTS-----
      1    Large 12-1/2-ounce can white
           Or light meat tuna, drained
      2 tb Vegetable Oil
      1    Apple; cored and chopped
      1 sm Onion; chopped
    1/2 ts Curry
      3 tb Flour
    1/2 c  Milk
      1 c  Chicken bouillon; (that's
           -one cube of bouillon in one
           -cup of water)
      1    (8-ounce) package egg
           Noodles; cooked & drained
           Or
      1 c  Cooked rice
 
  THIS MEAL IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WRECK AND QUICK TO MAKE
  
       Fry the apple and onion in a little oil until lightly cooked. Add
  flour and slowly stir in milk and bouillon. That will make a lumpy
  white sauce.  (The lumps are from the apple and onions and are not
  your fault.) Add tuna, breaking it up well, and sprinkle in the
  curry. Mix well. Serve over hot noodles which take nine minutes to
  cook and should have been started back while the apples and onions
  were cooking. If time is not a problem, serve this over rice.  (Now
  that should have been started BEFORE the apples and onions.)

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 oz Ginger ale
      1 oz Club soda
 
  I made up the name for this. Sometimes pool hustlers and other
  gamblers like to look as though they are drinking alcohol when they
  are actually remaining sober. One of the prime choices is half and
  half club soda and ginger ale. It looks like a Scotch and soda, and a
  well-tipped waitress will bring you this harmless concoction in the
  same glass as is used to serve a Scotch and soda whenever you order a
  Scotch and soda, and no one is the wiser.

      1 cn Chiles,green,mild,whole
      1 cn Jalapeno peppers,pickled
      2 tb Hot pepper sauce,liquid
      1 tb Butter
      3    Chiles,fresh whole green
    1/2 c  Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Sauterne
     12 oz Beer
 
  1. In a large non-aluminum (preferably glass or glazed cast iron)
     bowl make a marinade by combining the burgundy, thyme, bay leaves,
     garlic, and black pepper. Place all the beef in the bowl and mix
     lightly to coat the meat well. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
     (If time is short marinate for 2 hours at room temperature.)
  
  2. Place the chicken breasts in a saucepan with enough water to
     cover. Add 1 teaspoon salt and simmer over low heat for 1/2 hour.
     Remove the chicken reserving the liquid. Chop the chicken breasts
     fine and reserve.
  
  3. Meal the oil in a large heavy pot. Add the onions and cook until
     they are translucent.
  
  4. Meanwhile, drain the beef, straining and reserving the marinade.
     Mix the beef and pork together, then combine the meats with the
     ground chile, cayenne pepper, oregano, cumin, rosemary, and the
     rest of the salt.  Add this meat-and-spice mixture to the pot with
     the onions. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring
     occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned.
  
  5. Add half the marinade, the reserved chicken, tomatoes, both tomato
     sauces, jalapenos, and 1 tablespoon of liquid hot pepper sauce to
     the pot.
  
  6. Melt the butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the fresh
     chiles, mushrooms, and a small amount of the Sauterne and cook for
     3 minutes. Add this to the pot.
  
  7. Bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered, for at least
        3    hours. When
     the chili is cooking, from time to time stir in the remaining
     marinade, the remaining Sauterne, and beer. If more liquid is
     needed, stir in the water the chicken was cooked in. Taste and
     adjust seasonings.

      Title: HYDE PARK FUDGE CAKE
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  5 1/3 oz Bitter chocolate (bakery
           -uses Guittard brand)
    2/3 c  Shortening
  2 2/3    Eggs (this is right -- comes
           -from conversion of recipe)*
  1 1/3 c  Water
    3/4 c  Sour milk
  1 1/3 ts Vanilla
      3 c  Flour
  2 3/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/3 ts Baking soda
  1 1/3 ts Salt
           Icing:
    3/4 c  Sugar
      6 tb Evaporated milk
      3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
  1 1/2 ts Butter
 
  *Whether home cooks throw in that extra 1/3 egg is up to them, but
  baker and Rio Grande store manager Janine Gwaltney believes it makes a
  difference.  "Too much egg and the cake falls in the center," she
  says.
  
  Grease a Bundt pan.  Dust with fine bread crumbs and chill.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt the chocolate with the shortening.
  
  Combine eggs, water, milk, and vanilla.  Blend well. Mix flour, sugar,
  soda, and salt thoroughly. (If you don't, the flour will clump in the
  batter.) Gradually add dry ingredients to liquid ingredients,
  blending on low speed of mixer until just mixed, scraping bowl well.
  Pour into pan and bake until done, 50-65 minutes. Cool in the pan 30
  minutes. Turn out on a cake rack and glaze with icing.
  
  Icing:  While cake is cooling, heat the sugar in the evaporated milk
  in the top of a double boiler until the sugar is dissolved. (The
  mixture will not feel grainy when rubbed between the fingers.) Melt
  butter and chocolate together.  Combine with chocolate mixture. You
  may add one to two tsp hot water to the icing to enhance the sheen.
  Pour icing over the cake.

      Title: HYPOCRASSE (SPICED WINE)
 Categories: Beverages, Alcohol, Desert
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    Liter dry red wine
     60 g  Cinnamon
     60 g  Ground ginger
     10 g  Ground cardamom
     10 g  Ground nutmeg
     10    Whole cloves
     50 cl Rose water (optional)
    100 g  Sugar (up to 200)
 
  Easy process: (more waste) Pour the wine and spices in a large
  container. Wait 3 to 5 hours. Filter with a piece of old teeshirt.
  Filter again if desired with coffee filter. Add sugar and adjust to
  taste. Pour back in bottles or drink. Will keep at room temprature
  for about 2 weeks.
  
  Long process: (recommended) Pour wine into large container. Put
  spices in a finely woven tight towel and tie shut making sure the
  wine will flow thru the spices and be permeated. Let the spice bag
  sit in the wine for 2 to 3 days, stirring occasionaly.  Filter as
  above and add sugar. This method results in more yield because the
  spices wont turn into a slime blob at the bottom and use so much
  liquid.

      Title: ICE CREAM SANDWICHES - MARTHA STEWART LIVING
 Categories: Desserts, Dairy, Soup/stews, Sandwiches
      Yield: 24 Sandwiches
 
      2 c  Plus 2 T all-purpose flour
      2 tb Unsweetened cocoa
      5 oz Semisweet chocolate
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      3 lg Eggs, at room temperature
      1 pt Each strawberry, vanilla, &
           -chocolate ice cream
 
  1. Combine flour and cocoa and set aside. Melt together chocolates and
  butter in medium bowl set over simmering water. Stir with a wooden
  spoon until smooth. Add salt and sugar, stirring until sugar is
  almost completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat.
  Beat in eggs one at a time, then fold in flour mixture until well
  combined. Let dough cool slightly in bowl; it will be very soft.
  Divide into quarters and spoon onto plastic wrap. Flatten each piece
  of dough with a wooden spoon, wrap well, and refrigerate for at least
        2    hours or overnight.
  
  2. When dough is firm, cut each piece in half. Cover a work surface
  with plastic wrap. Place piece of dough on the plastic and cover with
  another sheet; roll out to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Keeping dough in
  plastic, transfer to a baking sheet; place in freezer. Repeat process
  until all dough is and rolled out. Stack sheets of dough in freezer
  and chill until very firm, about 30 minutes,
  
  3. Heat oven to 350'. Line 1 baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove
  sheets of dough from freezer one at a time. Place on a
  parchment-lined work surface and peel off plastic wrap. Using a 2
  1/2- inch round cookie cutter, cut out dough and transfer circles to
  baking sheets. Work quickly to prevent the dough from becoming too
  soft.
  
  4. Bake until cookies are firm to the touch, 14 to 16 minutes, turning
  baking sheet halfway through baking. Remove from oven and let cookies
  cool slightly on pan. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
  
  5. While cookies are baking, transfer ice cream (working with one
  flavor at a time) to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
  paddle attachment. Place ice cream in refrigerator to soften
  slightly, about 15 minutes. Beat ice cream on medium-high speed until
  soft enough to spread, about 2 minutes, or beat with a wooden spoon.
  Set bowl in a second bowl filled with ice. Spoon some softened ice
  cream onto a cookie and top with another cookie. Place sandwich in
  freezer and continue process. After the ice cream has hardened, wrap
  sandwiches tightly in plastic wrap. Chill overnight in freezer.

           OR 1  cake compressed
           -yeast
      1    Egg, well beaten
      2 ts Salt
      6 tb Sugar
      2 c  Lukewarm water
      3 tb Melted shortening
  6 1/2 c  Flour
 
  Soften yeast in lukewarm water.  If dry yeast is used combine the
  sugar, yeast, and water and allow to stand in a warm place 1 1/2
  hours. If compressed yeast is used allow to stand in lukewarm water 5
  minutes. Add salt, egg, sugar, if sugar has not already been added,
  and shortening. Mix well.  Add flour, a little at a time, beating
  thoroughly after each addition until dough is stiff enough to knead.
  Knead on lightly floured board until the dough is smooth and elastic.
  Cover dough with a warm, damp cloth.  Set in a moderately warm place
  and allow to stand 2 hours. Work down, cover closely with waxed
  paper, and place in the refrigerator overnight.  If baking rolls for
  luncheon or dinner, remove desired portion of dough from the
  refrigerator and allow about 2 hours to warm to room temperature and
  become light. Form into rolls. Cover and let rise until treble in
  bulk. Place on well-oiled baking sheet. Bake in hot oven (450x F)
  about 15 minutes. This dough will keep for 1 week or 10 days in a
  refrigerator if it is worked down each day to prevent its becoming
  too light.  The dough should be kept closely covered with waxed paper
  to prevent a crust from forming over the surface. 32 rolls.

 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Seems that blueberries only got to Oz in the early 70's and are only
  now becoming affordable.
  
  This is one of Gabriel Gate's excellent. low-fat recipes. It was first
  published in his book Smart Food (Anne O'Donovan, 1989) for the
  Anti-Cancer Council.
  
  Blend 500 g blueberries to a puree with the juice of 2 oranges and 1
  lemon.
  
  Strain the mixture.  Stir in 1/4 cup sugar.  Beat together 1 cup
  low-fat yoghurt and 2 tablespoons low-fat milk for about 5 minutes to
  lighten them.
  
  Add 1/4 cup of sugar and beat for a further minute. Gently combine the
  fruit preparation with the milk and yoghurt mixture. Either freeze in
  an ice cream maker or put the mixture in the freezer in a bowl and as
  the mixture hardens, whisk it two or three times.  When it is too
  firm to whisk any more, it is ready.
  
  Makes 10 servings.

      3 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Food coloring (optional)
 
   Children love these because the ginger and molasses flavors are not
  overwhelming.
  
   In a large bowl, mix molasses, sugar, shortening and hot water. Stir
  to combine thoroughly, although shortening doesn't need to melt
  completely.
  
   In a separate bowl, mix baking soda, ginger and cinnamon with 4 cups
  of flour. Mix into liquids, stirring to blend well. Gradually add
  enough of the additional flour to make a dough stiff enough to roll.
  Chill 1-2 hours before baking.
  
   Preheat oven to 350. Grease cookie sheets. Roll out dough to about
  1/6-inch thick and cut shapes with your favorite cookie cutter. Bake
  8-11 minutes at 350 until done. Cool completely and frost with
  decorative frosting. Cookies can also be dusted with decorative sugar
  or sprinkles prior to baking.
  
   To make frosting, beat egg whites until frothy, then beat in sugar
  and vanilla. If you like, separate the icing into several bowls and
  add a drop or two of food coloring. To yellow, add 1/2 teaspoon lemon
  extract.

 Categories: Improv, Kohl, Beverages, Home remedy
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Tea bags - 5 or 6
      1 ga Water
 
  To make tea the easy way, fill a gallon container with water and add
  5-6 tea bags. Refrigerate overnight.
  
  OR bring about 2 cups of water to a boil, add the tea bags, let boil
  for only 10-15 seconds. Cover, let stand about 30 minutes. Fill a
  gallon container 3/4 full with water and add the hot tea AND the tea
  bags. Fill the container to the top with water.
  
  Leaving the tea bags in the water prevents scum forming on the tea!
  
  Home Remedy: Tea contains theophylline, which is a bronchodilator.
  Therefore, tea is good for breathing problems, colds, etc. Instant
  tea does NOT contain theophylline.

  with flour.
  
  On a lightly floured surface, roll out each part of dough to make a
  thin round about 8 inches in diameter. Place the rounds on the
  floured waxed paper.  Chill 30 minutes.
  
  In a skillet, heat 2 inches of fat to 375 to 400 degrees F. Vegetable

           Fruit
 
  *Colorings*.  --For *Blue* rub a piece of indigo with a little water
  and add by drops to the mixture to be colored until the desired shade
  is reached. For *Brown* use grated chocolate, or for a very light
  brown, *Caramel*, which is prepared for immediate use by putting cup
  granulated sugar in *iron* skillet or frying-pan set over fire, and
  stirring, constantly until a dark brown color and as thick as
  molasses. When properly done a cup sugar will make five tablespoons
  coloring. When preparing for bottling, boil a longer time, then add a
  half pint water and boil again, until a little cooled in saucer is
  found thick as molases or honey. If too thick, or if it candies, add
  a little more water and boil again. Bottle, and if kept corked it
  will never spoil. For *Green* use either the Parsley or Spinach
  Coloring, given on page 180. For *Pink* use strawberry, currant or
  cranberry juice or jelly. If a bright *Red* is desired, Mix one
  drachm each pulverized alum and cream tartar, four drachms powdered
  cochineal, two ounces loaf sugar and saltspoon soda; or
  sameproportions in level tablespoons are two-thirds tablespoon
  pulverized alum, half tablespoon cream tartar, two and a half of
  powdered cochineal, four of pounded oaf sugar and the saltspoon soda;
  boil ten minutes in half pint pure soft water and when cool bottle
  and cook for use. For *Yellow*, use the juice of a carrot or the
  grated peel of an orange or lemon, moistened withthe juice or a
  little water, and squeezed through a cloth. When a deeper color is
  wanted boil a little American saffron with a little water till a
  bright yellow, strain and cool, and use enough to give desired shade;
  some use a mixture ofan ounce turmeric with four of deodorized
  alcohol shaking till dissolved and then straining and bottling. No
  objection can be made to the use of any of the above, save perhaps to
  the blue, which is very seldom used, and only for Ornamental Icing,
  The others are all fruit or vegetable preparations, and their use
  adds greatly to the handsome appearance of ices and ice-creams, icing
  jellies, cakes, creams and pudding and other sauces. To guard against
  getting in too much coloring, use by putting in a very little at
  first, mixing well, then add a very little more until desired shade
  is obtained.

      1 lb Sugar, confectioners
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Nuts; chopped, or to taste
 
  Cake:  In a mixing bowl, mix sugar, flour and soda together. In a
  saucepan, melt margarine; stir in cocoa and water and bring to a
  boil. Pour hot mixture over dry ingredients; stir well. Mix in
  buttermilk, eggs and salt. Pour into a greased jelly roll pan. Bake
  at 400 degrees F. for about 15 minutes, until top springs back when
  touched.
  
  Frosting: In same saucepan used for cake, melt margarine. Stir in
  cocoa and buttermilk and bring to a rapid boil. Remove from heat and
  stir in the sugar and vanilla; blend thoroughly. Stir in nuts. Spread
  over cake as soon as it comes out of the oven. Be prepared to clean
  up some drips.
  
  If there are kids around, let them clean up the drips ~ this frosting
  is like fudge! The frosting is so good ~ it's almost like the cake
  exists just to give a base to the frosting. Mom cuts the frosting
  recipe down (about in half) but I like it just the way it is - lots.

      Title: IDEAS FOR USING COTTAGE CHEESE
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  These are some cool ideas for using cottage cheese I found ages ago
  in a magazine.
  
  Pasta Alfredo:  Blend until smooth:  one part skim milk to four parts
  cottage cheese, some grated Parmesan, a little fresh dill, nutmeg and
  black pepper.  Toss with hot whole-wheat pasta.
  
  Salad dressing:  2 tablespoons cottage cheese, 2 teaspoons oil, 2
  teaspoons apple-cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon
  oregano, a dash of garlic powder.
  
  Whipped-Cream substitute:  Whip at high speed 1 cup cottage cheese
  with 2 tablespoons any kind of unsweetened frozen fruit-juice
  concentrate until peaks form. Serve immediately. (My favourites are
  pineapple or lemon concentrate.  )
  
  Sour cream taste-alike:  In blender, process 1/2 cup buttermilk,
  yogurt or skim milk with 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice. Gradually
  blend in 1 cup cottage cheese until consistency is right. (I find the
  yogurt works best for this.  )
  
  Low-calorie cream:  Blend together equal parts low-fat cottage cheese
  and vanilla yogurt.  Even lower in calories: Use plain yogurt,
  vanilla extract, and Sweet `N Low (or equivalent). Refrigerate at
  least 8 hours before using.  Serve over fruit.
  
  Imitation cream cheese:  Blend 1 cup low-fat cottage cheese and 1/4
  cup plain yogurt; add a teaspoon or more of skim milk, as needed, for
  cream-cheese consistency.
  
  I keep mucking around with amounts and seasonings and have ended up
  with some really strange-looking concoctions. If anyone has any other
  suggestions or methods, please share!

      Title: IDENTIFYING & HANDLING SPOILED CANNED FOOD
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  Do not taste food from a jar with an unsealed lid or food that shows
  signs of spoilage.
  
  You can more easily detect some types of spoilage in jars stored
  without screw bands. Growth of spoilage bacteria and yeast produces
  gas which pressurizes the food, swells lids, and breaks jar seals. As
  each stored jar is selected for use, examine its lid for tightness
  and vacuum. Lids with concave centers have good seals.
  
  Next, while holding the jar upright at eye level, rotate the jar and
  examine its outside surface for streaks of dried food originating at
  the top of the jar. Look at the contents for rising air bubbles and
  unnatural color.
  
  While opening the jar, smell for unnatural odors and look for spurting
  liquid and cottonlike mold growth (white, blue, black, or green) on
  the top food surface and underside of lid.
  
  Spoiled low-acid foods, including tomatoes, may exhibit different
  kinds of spoilage evidence or very little evidence. Therefore, all
  suspect containers of spoiled low-acid foods, including tomatoes,
  should be treated as having produced botulinum toxin and handled
  carefully in one of two ways:
  
  * If the swollen metal cans or suspect glass jars are still sealed,
  place them in a heavy garbage bag. Close and place the bag in a
  regular trash container or bury it in a nearby landfill.
  
  * If the suspect cans or glass jars are unsealed, open, or leaking,
  they should be detoxified before disposal.
  
  Detoxification process:
  
  Carefully place the suspect containers and lids on their sides in an
  8-quart volume or larger stock pot, pan, or boiling-water canner.
  Wash your hands thoroughly. Carefully add water to the pot. The water
  should completely cover the containers with a minimum of a 1-inch
  level above the containers. Avoid splashing the water. Place a lid on
  the pot and heat the water to boiling. Boil 30 minutes to ensure
  detoxifying the food and all container components. Cool and discard
  the containers, their lids, and food in the trash or bury in soil.
  
  Thoroughly scrub all counters, containers, and equipment including can
  opener, clothing, and hands that may have contacted the food or
  containers. Discard any sponges or wash cloths that may have been
  used in the cleanup. Place them in a plastic bag and discard in the
  trash.

 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian, Vegetables
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Eggplants
           Salt
      3 md Onions; peeled and sliced
    1/2 c  Water
      5 tb Olive oil
      5    Fresh tomatoes;
           - peeled and sliced, -=OR=-
      8    -Canned plum tomatoes,sliced
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      4    Garlic cloves
           - peeled and sliced
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 pn Granulated sugar
           Fresh parsley for garnish
 
  *Note: 8 canned plum tomatoes, sliced, may be substituted for the 5
  fresh. Wash the eggplants, cut off the stem end if using large ones
  and cut in half lengthwise. With the tip of a sharp knife, make at
  least 3 lengthwise slashes on the cut sides of the eggplants, being
  careful not to pierce the skin on the opposite side. Sprinkle with
  salt and let stand for 30 minutes. Rinse with cold water, dry, and
  invert to drain. Meanwhile, put the onions in a small pan with the
  1/2 cup water and simmer a few minutes. Drain and discard the water
  or save for soup. In a medium frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the
  oil and saute the onions until soft, then put approximately a third
  of them in the bottom of a buttered casserole large enough to
  accomodate all the eggplants. Set 4 to 5 tomato slices over the
  onions in the casserole and add the rest of the tomatoes to the onion
  remaining in the frying pan. Saute onions and tomatoes for 10
  minutes, then stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the parsley and remove
  from the heat. Set the eggplants into the casserole, tuck a slice of
  garlic into each eggplant slash, and stuff the slashes with the
  filling, allowing some to cover the top of the eggplant. Season
  lightly with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar, then dribble the
  remaining oil and chopped parsley over the eggplants.  Cover the
  casserole with a lid or aluminum foil and bake in a moderate oven
  (350 F) for 30 to 40 minutes, until fork-tender, removing the cover
  during the last 10 minutes, to allow the sauce to thicken. Garnish
  with parsley and serve warm. Note: This is excellent as a first
  course of a subsequently light meal topped with fresh fruit and
  Turkish coffee. If you wish, you may leave the eggplants whole, slash
  one side and remove some of the pulp with a small spoon. This pulp is
  then sauteed with the filing and stuffed into the eggplant, a very
  attractive method for the smaller eggplants.  As you might suspect,
  both variations may also be prepared on top of the stove.

    1/2 c  Olive oil
      6 lg Garlic cloves; peeled
      2 tb Parsley; finely chopped,
           ;prefer flat leaf parsley
 
    With a sharp knife, cut off the stem and peel each eggplant
  lengthwise, leaving 4 evenly spaced 1 inch wide strips of peel
  intact. Slicing between the strips, cut each one in half. Cut side
  up, make three or four 4 inch long lengthwise slashes through the
  thickest part of each half, spacing the slashes about 1 inch apart.
  Sprinkle the eggplants with 1 tablespoon of the salt and arrange them
  in two or three layers in a large flat bowl or pan. Pour in enough
  cold water to cover them by 1 inch, weight with a heavy casserole,
  and let the eggplants rest at room temperature for at least 30
  minutes.
    Meanwhile, drop the onion rings into a large colander set in a deep
  plate.  Sprinkle the onions with 3 tablespoons of the salt, turning
  them about with a spoon to coat them evenly. Let stand at room
  temperature for at least 30 minutes, then rinse the onions under warm
  running water and squeeze them gently but completely dry. Place them
  in a bowl, add the tomatoes and the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt and
  toss together thoroughly.
    Pour 2 tablespoons of the oil into a heavy casserole large enough
  to hold the eggplants in one layer. Drain the eggplants, rinse them
  under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange the eggplants
  cut side up in the casserole.  Force as much of the onion-tomato
  mixture as possible into the slashes and spread the rest on top.
  Place a garlic clove on each eggplant half, and sprinkle them with
  the remaining 6 tablespoons of oil. Pour in the cup of water and
  bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer
  covered for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the eggplants are tender.
  Cool in the casserole to room temperature.
    To serve, arrange the eggplants n a large platter or individual
  serving plates, spoon the cooking juices around them and sprinkle
  with parsley.

      Title: IMPERIAL COCONUT FLAN
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1    Small coconut
      5    Small eggs, separated
           Pinch   salt
           Flan mold coated with
           Caramel
 
       Preheat the oven to 450F.
  
       Place the sugar and milk in a heavy saucepan and melt the sugar
  over low heat, then raise the heat and boil the mixture briskly. Take
  care that it does not boil over. As soon as the mixture begins to
  thicken, stir it so that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan.
  After about 30 minutes it should be the consistency of thin condensed
  milk and has been reduced to 1 cup.  See Note.
  
       Pierce holes through two of the "eyes" of the coconut and drain
  the water from it.  Set the water aside.
  
       Put the whole coconut into the oven for about 8 minutes. Crack it
  open; the flesh should come away quite easily from the shell.
  
       Pare the brown skin from the coconut flesh with a potato peeler.
  Grate the coconut finely.  You will need 2 1/4 cups, loosely packed,
  for the flan.
  
       Add the grated coconut to the reserved coconut water and boil it
  for about 5 minutes, stirring it constantly.
  
       Add the "condensed" milk and continue cooking for another 5
  minutes. Set the mixture aside to cool.
  
       Beat the egg yolks together until they are creamy and stir them
  well into the coconut mixture.
  
       Beat the egg whites until they are frothy, add the salt and
  continue beating until they are stiff. Fold them into the mixture.
  
       Pour the mixture into the prepared mold.  Cover the mold with a
  well-greased lid and place into a water bath.
  
       Cook the flan on the lowest shelf of the oven for about 1 1/2
  hours, then test to see if it is done. When it is done, set it aside
  to cool.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  NOTES:
       Of course, you can substitute1 cup of lightly thinned canned,
  sweetened condensed milk for the milk and sugar and substitute
  pre-grated but unsweetened coconut. Use milk instead of coconut
  water; the flavor will just not be quite as good.
  
       Do not think you have done something wrong when you see that the
  coconut and custard have separated. That is how it is meant to be. The
  caramel will nearly all have been absorbed by the spongy layer of
  coconut.
  
       If you are using fresh coconut there will almost certainly be
  some left over.  It will keep perfectly well if frozen.
  
       To test to see if the flan is cooked through, insert the blade
  of a knife or a skewer well into the flan. The knife should come out
  clean. Take care not to pierce the flan at the bottom or it will
  spoil the appearance of the top when it is unmolded.

      Title: IMPERIAL ROLLS
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian, Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Cellophane noodles
      2 lg Onions, sliced very thin
      2    Green peppers, sliced thin
      6    Cloves garlic, minced
      2    Jalapeno peppers, minced
    1/2    To 2/3 c sesame oil
      7    Or 8 med shiitake mushrooms,
           -sliced very thin
      3    Carrots, shredded
      1 c  Mint leaves, chopped
      1 bn Basil, chopped
      1 bn Cilantro, chopped
      1    5" piece ginger, peeled and
           -minced
    3/4 c  Roasted peanuts, chopped
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
      3 tb Teriyaki sauce
      3 tb Black rice vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
           Juice from one lime
           Black pepper to taste
      1 pk Rice paper rounds
           Vegetable oil for frying
 
  These crispy rolls are made with Vietnamese rice paper ~ huge, round,
  translucent and very brittle.  If you cannot find these exotic rice
  paper sheets, you can use filo dough instead (See Cook's Note). I
  must say, the first time I used these rice papers I almost gave up
  after only three minutes.  Be patient and practice a bit. Once you
  get the hang of it, the rest will go smoothly. Be sure to use plenty
  of water when spraying the sheets, roll as quickly as possible and
  keep the sheets covered as you work.  A challenge indeed, but well
  worth the effort. Rice papers as well as cellophane noodles can be
  found in any Asian supermarket.
  
  Soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 2 or 3 minutes. Cut
  into 4" lengths and drain.  Cook in boiling water until done, about 4
  or 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
  
  Cook onions, green peppers, garlic and jalapeno peppers in the sesame
  oil over high heat until wilted.
   Stir frequently to prevent burning. When the vegetables are wilted,
  add the shiitake mushrooms and cook over low heat until they are soft
  but not mushy. Place in a large bowl and cool. When the mixture is
  cool, add all the remaining ingredients except the rice paper and
  vegetable oil. Taste and adjust seasonings.
  
  To assemble:  Take one sheet of rice paper out of the package, dip in
  a large bowl of water, or spray using a plastic spray bottle, and lay
  out on a flat surface. Quickly place about 3 Tbs of the filling on
  the bottom of the round and roll up, tucking the ends in as you go.
  Seal with more water and set aside, seam side down. Make all rolls in
  this fashion. Heat about 2" of vegetable in a large skillet. When the
  oil it hot, but not smoking, add the rolls in batches and cook until
  golden brown on all sides. Remove from pan and drain on lint-free
  towels; do not use paper towels as the wrappers will stick to the
  paper.  Serve immediately.
  
  COOK'S NOTE:
  
  If using filo dough, cut sheets into long rectangles, approx. 6x8"
  long. Place some filling at the bottom of each piece of filo dough
  and roll up, tucking in the ends as you go. Brush with melted
  unsalted butter to seal. Cook in vegetable oil until golden brown.
  Be sure to cover the stack of filo dough at all times with a damp
  cloth to prevent it from drying out.

      Title: IMPOSSIBLE BREAKFAST PIE
 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6    Eggs
      2 c  Milk
      1 ts Dry mustard
      1 c  Bisquick
    1/2 ts Oregano leaves
      1 lb Sausage
      1 c  Cheese, cheddar, shredded
 
  Brown and drain sausage. Mix all ingredients together and cover.
  Refrigerate overnight.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Pour into greased 2-qt. casserole; bake until
  knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
  
  Sylvia's comments: This rose so much, it was about 1" over the top of
  the casserole!  2 adults and 2 children almost polished the whole
  thing off. Easy to make and flavorful, although the hour cooking time
  (50 minutes worked in my oven) limits it to weekends for us; I don't
  get up an hour before breakfast on weekdays. But for a special
  weekend breakfast, it's great.  I'd also like to try it split, 2
  servings to a foil pie pan; I bet it would take less baking time that
  way.

      Title: IMPROVED CORNBREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Baking Powder
      1 ts Baking Soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Honey
      2 tb Vegetable oil (lard or
           -crisco would have been
           -better)
      1 c  Buttermilk
      1 c  White flour
      1 c  Cornmeal
 
  Mix well while preheating greased pans or skillet at 400 for a few
  minutes. Pour in batter and bake at 400 for 20-25 minutes. Could be
  baked in cornbread pan or muffin tins also. I don't really use
  buttermilk by the way. It would go bad in the fridge because I bake
  so seldom. I use four tsp of dried buttermilk and one cup of water.
  The real thing would be better I presume. Medium bread pans filled
  half way will make two loafs.
  
  Skillet method would be heat oil or lard while heating the pan, then
  add to the batter before pouring into the skillet. Enjoy It!
  
  I found that some recipes called for one egg, some all cornmeal flour
  (which produces corn frisbees), some sugar instead of honey, and milk
  instead of buttermilk. Confused? I was. This is my creation and I'm
  not sure the salt is necessary. It will increase about 70% when
  baked. Origin. Pete Porro 14 June, 1992

        8    scallions -- thinly sliced
  :          including greens
        8    cloves garlic -- finely
  :          chopped
        4 TB fennel seeds -- toast and
  :          crush
        2 TB fresh ginger root
        2 TB hot Hungarian paprika
        2 ts cayenne
        2 ts cumin
        1 ts saffron threads -- or less
  :          finely chopped
        1 ts salt
        1 c  water
      1/2 c  fresh lemon juice
        2 TB extra virgin olive oil
       12    4 oz chicken breast halves,
  :          bone-in, skin removed
  
  Serve 1 breast per person with tzaziki sauce, couscous and grilled
  bell pepper strips. TZAKIKI SAUCE, a Greek sauce made with yogurt,
  cucumbers and garlic. This recipe works equally well when cut in half
  to serve 6.
  
  Mix all ingredients, except chicken, in a nonmetallic bowl. Add
  chicken to the marinade; toss gently to coat pieces well. Cover and
  refrigerate for 1 to 2 days. Prepare a barbecue grill so coals are
  white-hot. Spray grill with nonstick coating. Remove chicken pieces
  from marinade and place on grill. Cook, turning chicken frequently so
  it does not burn, until juices run clear when large part of breast
  halves are pierced. Cooking time will vary between 12 and 20 minutes,
  depending on the heat of grill and the thickness of the breasts.

      Title: IMPROVED YAM-IN-GRAVY (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Text Recipe
 
  This is (roughly) a Tamil recipe from a cookbook that I bought in
  Bangalore, called a Cook's Tour of South India. I doubt it's available
  here. Fatfree- ized only by the deletion of 1/4 c. of oil.
  
  Simmer 2 c. of small red lentils in about 5 c. water while you are
  doing everything else.
  
  In a separate, large pot, dry pop (like making popcorn, over med
  heat):
  
  2 T. black mustard seeds
  
  Add to the pot:
  
  5 medium to large yams, peeled and cut into 1" cubes enough water to
  cover the yams by about 1/2" 1 T. turmeric 2 T. tamarind concentrate,
  blended with water so it dissolves easily in the pot (ever bite a
  lump of tamarind concentrate?) 1 t. (or more) compounded asafoetida 1
  T. (optional) finely ground dried coconut, microwaved with 1/2 c.
  rice milk
  
  Simmer yams until soft but not falling apart.   When lentils are soft
  (takes about 1/2 hr if you got the right kind) drain off any water
  you can and add lentils to the yam pot. Stir and cook, adding more
  water if mixture is too thick (texture of a thick soup is good,
  texture of refried beans is 'too thick'). Then add:
  
  1/2 c. fresh cilantro a handful of fresh or dried curry leaves salt to
  taste *fresh chili paste to taste *2 T.-1/4 c. chickpea (gram or
  besan) flour, mixed with water and gradually thinned to avoid lumps.
  Dribble into the soup while stirring.
  
  The chickpea flour replaces hand-ground chickpeas or mung beans, which
  thicken the stew, making the sauce more 'gravylike'. Yum. Also, using
  the red chili paste (a violently hot vietnamese concoction with
  citric acid added to fresh ground chilies) improves the taste. Yum.
  Yam.

      Title: IMPROVISED VEGETABLE STEW
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 sm Eggplant
    1/2    Butternut squash (or
           "pumkin" for the Aussies on
           The list!)
      1 md Potato
      1 ea Red and green bell pepper
           (capsicum)
      1    Heaping huge spoonful
           (according to taste) cooked
           Onions*
      1 cn Tomatoes and juice
      1    Splash red wine
      1    Splash balsamic vinegar
      1    Veggie stock cube
      2    Cloves (few) crushed garlic
      1 ts Turmeric
      1 ts Ginger, grated
      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Chili powder
 
  Cut up the vegies into chunks of roughly the same size, and cook over
  medium high heat in a non-stick skillet (no need to spray!)
  
  I tossed everything around in the skillet for a while, then chucked
  it into a casserole dish in the oven on medium-ish heat for 45
  minutes while we went out for our pre-dinner walk. You can adjust the
  seasonings to your own taste.
  
  I served this over rice steamed with a small handful of sultanas
  (golden raisins), and it was delicious.
  
  *About the onions. I think onions make anything taste a little more
  delicious, so as often as I need to, I get a couple of pounds (a
  kilo) of onions, slice them up in the food processor, put them into
  the non-stick skillet with just a little veggie stock (adding more as
  needed to stop sticking) over a medium heat, not stirring too often,
  for about an hour. After a while, they do stick a bit, and that's a
  great time to splash in a little red wine or balsamic vinegar to
  deglaze the pan. Then let them cook a little longer, until they have
  a beautiful caramel color and delicious, rich aroma. I keep them
  stored in the fridge and add them to anything and everything. There's
  nothing like them on a veggie pizza to make you forget they don't
  make ff cheese in Australia (yet!)

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Milk
      2 lg Eggs
      8 oz Can cream style corn
  1 1/4 c  Water ground cornmeal
           -(white)
     10 oz Sharp cheddar cheese ----
           -1/4 cup coarsely grated
           Remainder cut into 1/4 inch
           -cubes
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped hot
           -chilies, fresh or canned
      4 oz Can whole-sweet red
           -pimentos, roasted 1/2 cut
           -into long strips,
           Other 1/2 coarsely chunked
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
 
  In a small saucepan, melt 6 Tbsp. butter over low heat. Do not brown.
  Preheat oven to 400.  Put remaining 2 Tbsp. butter into an 8 inch
  diameter baking casserole;  heat in oven no more than 4 to 5 minutes
  to avoid browning butter.  Rotate and tilt casserole to coat inside.
  Set aside. In large mixing bowl, beat milk and eggs. Smoothly blend 1
  cup white cornmeal, melted butter, corn, diced cheese, chillies,
  chopped red pimento, baking soda, salt.  Mix thoroughly. It should
  have the consistency of southern cornbread, moderately runny but not
  down right liquid. If it seems to runny work in 1 or 2 tbsp. white
  cornmeal. Give butter in casserole a final swizzle, then pour in
  batter, smoothing it level. Sprinkle grated cheese over top and
  decorate with pimento strips. Do not cover. Place casserole, exactly
  in center of oven. Bake until a knife lightly pushed in center comes
  out clean and dry- usually 40 to 50 minutes. Serve at once. Cut into
  fairly thin, pie - shaped wedges. (You can let the bread cool to room
  temperature.) It stores well tightly wrapped in the refrigerator, but
  it is best not to serve it cold. One loaf makes about 8 servings.

      Title: INDIAN CHEESE (PANEER & CHANNA)
 Categories: Indian, Cheese/eggs, Ceideburg
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
  1 1/2 qt Whole milk
  1 1/2 c  Cultured buttermilk
 
  Pour milk into a heavy 4-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil over
  medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.
  
  Reduce heat to medium and stir in buttermilk.
  
  When the curds form a mass (you'll see a clear, pale-yellow whey
  surrounding the curds), remove pan from heat, Let stand, partially
  covered, for 10 minutes.
  
  Line a colander with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth. Set the
  colander in the sink or in a bowl if you wish to save the whey (see
  note).
  
  Gently pour the curds and whey into the cheesecloth.
  
  Gather together the corners of the cloth, give one or two twists, and
  tie with a kitchen twine.
  
  Hang the cheesecloth bag over the faucet and let the cheese drain for
  1 hour, or until it is as thick as yogurt (this is channa).
  
  If the weather is warm, leave the cheesecloth bag in the colander,
  set the colander on a plate to catch the drippings, and refrigerate
  until the cheese has thickened.
  
  Unwrap the channa and use immediately, or cover and store in the
  refrigerator for up to 4 days.
  
  Yields approximately 10 ounces.
  
  Note: Save the whey for making your next batch of paneer, use it for
  cooking lentils or pilafs, or add it to soups.
  
  Paneer cheese: Snugly wrap cheesecloth around the channa to form a
  "cake." Place on a cookie sheet, place another cookie sheet on top
  and add weights (for example, 2 or 3 large cans of tomatoes, 2 or 3
  bricks, a large pitcher of water). Let the cheese sit for 2 to
        4    hours.
  
  Use immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
  
  Yields 8 ounces (1 cup).

  Hang the cheesecloth bag over the faucet and let the cheese drain for
  1 hour, or until it is as thick as yogurt (this is channa).
  
  If the weather is warm, leave the cheesecloth bag in the colander,
  set the colander on a plate to catch the drippings, and refrigerate
  until the cheese has thickened.
  
  Unwrap the channa and use immediately, or cover and store in the
  refrigerator for up to 4 days.
  
  Yields approximately 10 ounces.
  
  Note: Save the whey for making your next batch of paneer, use it for
  cooking lentils or pilafs, or add it to soups.
  
  Paneer cheese: Snugly wrap cheesecloth around the channa to form a
  "cake." Place on a cookie sheet, place another cookie sheet on top
  and add weights (for example, 2 or 3 large cans of tomatoes, 2 or 3
  bricks, a large pitcher of water). Let the cheese sit for 2 to
        4    hours.
  
  Use immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
  
  Yields 8 ounces (1 cup).

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      2 oz Button mushrooms, chopped
      1    Onion, chopped
      2 ts Garam Masala
  3 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
      8 oz Cooked chicken, diced
    1/3 c  Frozen corn, thawed
           Salt to taste
           Fresh ground pepper to taste
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Cold margarine, diced
    1/3 c  Lard, diced
    1/4 c  Cold water
      1    Egg, beaten
           Tomato slices, halved (opt)
           Fresh parsley sprigs (opt)
 
  Melt butter in a saucepan. Add mushrooms, onion and Garam Masala and
  cook 2 minutes.
  
  Stir in 1/4 cup of flour and cook 1 minute, then stir in stock and
  bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and cook 2 minutes,
  stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in chicken, corn, salt
  and pepper; cool.
  
  Sift remaining flour into a bowl. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and cut in
  margarine and lard finely until mixture resembles bread crumbs. Add
  cold water and mix to form a fairly firm dough. Knead gently until
  smooth.
  
  Preheat oven to 375'F. (175'C.). Preheat a baking sheet. Cut off 2/3
  of pastry and cut in 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece to a 7" circle.
  Line 4 (5") fluted pie pans with removable bottoms with pastry
  circles, allowing pastry to overlap top edges slightly. Press pastry
  well into flutes but do not trim top edge. Cut remaining 1/3 of
  pastry in 4 equal pieces and roll each piece to a 6" circle.
  
  Spoon cold chicken mixture into pastry-lined flan pans and smooth
  surfaces. Dampen edges of pastry in pans and cover with pastry
  circles. Seal edges well and trim by pressing pastry edges firmly
  flat blade of a knife. Make a small hole in center of each pie.
  Reroll pastry trimmings and cut out leaves to decorate pies. Brush
  surfaces of pies with egg, then decorate with leaves and brush leaves
  with egg.
  
  Place flan pans on preheat baking sheet and bake in preheated oven
  40-45 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and filling is heated
  through. Cool before carefully removing from pans. Garnish with
  tomato slices and parsley sprigs, if desired, and serve cold.
  
  VARIATION: Substitute Curry Powder for Garam Masala or try a mixture
  of each.

           Salt
           Black pepper
 
    This is a very colorful and tasty arrangement of marinated and then
  skewered and grilled vegetables and fish. The marinade, called
  chermoulla, is a blend of fragrant seasonings, oil, and lemon juice.
  In this version I've suggested my favorite vegetables for kebabs. You
  should choose your own favorites; some other good choices are
  eggplants, mushrooms, and onions. special equipment: skewers (if you
  are using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for 1/2 hr. and fill
  them out to the ends so the skewers won't burn)
  
  Combine the ingredients for the chermoulla.  Cut the fish into 1-inch
  cubes.  Similarily, cut the vegetables into 1-inch cubes. Place the
  fish and vegetables in the chermoulla and marinate, refrigerated, for
  2 hours.
    When you are ready to assemble the kebab, soften the bay leaves in
  boiling water for several minutes. Alternate the tomatoes, peppers,
  yellow squash, and fish on skewers. Place a bay leaf occasionally on
  the skewers next to the fish.  Reserve the chermoulla.
    Cover the broiler pan with foil and plkace the kebabs on it about
  an inch apart.  Broil for 15 to 20 minutes, basting with the reserved
  chermoulla, and turning frequently to cook evenly.
    Serve on rice or in pita bread and garnish with lemon wedges and
  sprigs of mint. From Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant

  Tandoor(i) is an earthern (?) oven btw.  The famous vegetarian items
  made with them are perhaps naan and 'tandoori' roti. Roti is a simple
  Indian bread which may also be known as chapati to some. Naan/roti
  with aloo mattar/panneer mattar/aloo palak etc. is a wonderful
  combination.
  
  > What are the hindhi names for the green (brown) lentils and orange

  i dont know about the green ones, but the red ones are masoor daal
  (sometimes spelled masur, and other variants).
  
  > Are the other types of lentils actually lentils or split peas? Are
  they > obtained from an Indian/Paki store?
  
  Mung daal is just split and hulled mung beans, the same little green
  jobs used for generic bean sprouts by the Chinese & others. Tuvar
  daal is also called toor daal, and comes in oily & non oily forms.
  They look similar to Western yellow split peas (a bit bigger, less
  brightly yellow, and flatter though).  In fact, i've seen some
  recipes which suggest substituting yellow split peas for tuvar daal
  if you cant get the real thing; won't taste exactly the same but it
  works. SO neither daal is a pea or a lentil, officially, just some
  more legumes. They should be readily available at any Indian or
  Pakistani store; mung beans may be available at SE Asian/Chinese
  groceries too, although maybe only the whole kind....

  >Masoor Daal, split red lentils >Urad Daal, a small white lentil
  normally used for making masla dosas. >Chana Daal, garbanzo
  beans/chickpeas
  
  True, but most of the time Chana dal (no, not China Doll ;-)) refers
  to a bean that looks a lot like split yellow peas, but a little
  bigger and yellower.  It tastes very different though. Often roasted
  and fried in small quantities as a spice.  No substitutes. Available
  in Indian stores.
  
  >Toor Daal, oiled split peas
  
  Not split peas, but rather a dal of its own.  Looks like split yellow
  peas, with kind of a dull yellow color. Used in sambar.A lot of
  Indians I know say it's their favorite basic dal, but I don't happen
  to like it. Also called Toovar Dal.
  
  Comes in oiled and nonoiled form.

      Title: INDIAN FRUIT PUDDING
 Categories: Fruit, Native amer
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Chokecherries or blueberries
      4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar or honey, or to taste
 
  This dish was originally made with chokecherries. These tiny cherries
  are bitter enough to surprise you, and the pit is the biggest part of
  the fruit. The whole cherry, pit and all, was pounded up and used to
  preserve meat, and they are certainly sour enough to do just that.
  When they were made into a pudding it must have taken the family's
  entire stock of honey to provide enough sweetening. Wild blueberries,
  which could not be preserved so easily, were also used for this dish.
  
  Boil the berries in the water. Drain the juice and set aside. Mash the
  berries and mix with the flour. Combine the sugar or honey with the
  juice and add to the berry/flour mix. Stir well. If lumps are present
  add a little more water and continue to stir. Bring to a simmer and
  stir constantly until thick. Check for sweetness. Cool and serve.

      Title: INDIAN HOMINY
 Categories: Side dish
      Yield: 5 Cups
 
      2 c  Dried corn kernels
     10 c  Water
      1 c  Culinary ash -=OR=-
      2 tb Baking soda
 
  Soak the dried corn overnight in a bowl filled with the cold water.
  The following day, put the corn and water into an enameled pot.
  (Because the culinary ash reacts with metal, hominy must be processed
  in an enameled pot) Cover and bring to a boil over hight heat. When
  the water begins to boil, stir in the culinary ash. At this point,
  the ash will intensify the color of the kernels. Cover and reduce
  heat. Simmer over low heat for about 5 1/2 hours, until the hulls are
  loose and the corn returns to its original color. Stir occasionally
  and replenish with enough water to cover the corn when necessary, or
  it will dry out and burn on the bottom. Under cold running water, rub
  corn between fingers to remove hulls, which should be discarded.
  Drain corn in a colander. To dry hominy in the traditional manner,
  spread the cooked and hulled corn on an open weave basket or screen
  and place in full sun, turning the kernels every few hours, until
  completely dry.  Alternatively, place the kernels on a sheet pan in a
  gas oven with the pilot light on, or in an electric oven on the
  lowest setting, turning every few hours until dry. (Check by breaking
  open a kernel: If there is any moisture inside, keep drying.) Once
  propery dried, hominy will keep almost indefinitely without spoilage.
  ***NOTE*** Culinary ash is made from burning the wood of certain
  trees until there is only ash left. Many types of trees and bushes
  found in the Southwest can be used; the Navajos use juniper primarily
  and the Hopis use green plants such as suwvi or chamisa bushes. The
  green twigs, when burned, produce an ash with a high mineral content.
  When used in cooking, it increases the food's nutritional value. When
  culinary ash is mixed with boiling water and corn,the alkaline level
  in the ash reacts with the corn and changes it to a more intense
  color. After the water has cooled, the corn changes again - to
  something close to its original color. If you live in an area where
  culinary ash is difficult to obtain, baking soda can be used as a
  substitute, although it doesn't have the high nutritional content of
  ash. Substitute 2 tablespoons baking soda for 1 cup ash.

  Heat the oil in a skillet and add the onions. Cook, stirring, about 10
  minutes, or til they are caramel colored. Add the garlic, ginger and
  chiles and cook 2 minutes longer. Add the ground meat and cook,
  stirring and chopping with the side of a heavy metal spoon to break
  up any lumps. Cook until the meat loses its raw look and starts to
  brown. Sprinkle with tumeric and salt and stir. Add the water, cover
  and cook over low heat about 25 minutes, stirring often to prevent
  browning and sticking. When ready, all the liquid should be absorbed.
  If it is not, uncover and cook till all liquid is evaporated. Stir in
  the garum masala, lemon juice and coriander.

      Title: INDIAN MANGO SORBET
 Categories: Indian, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  Mango sorbet are always delicious but this one has the added interest
  of lime and cardamom flavours.  The recipe comes from the recently
  published "Quick and Easy Indian Vegetarian Cookery" by Sandeep
  Chatterjee. BBC Books, 1992, $16.95.
  
  Put 150 g sugar in a small saucepan with 150 mL water. Stir until the
  sugar has dissolved then simmer briskly 3 to 4 minutes to make a
  syrup. Remove from the heat and chill. When it is cold, add it to 275
  g ripe mango pulp, together with the juice of 1 lime and a third of a
  tablespoon of ground cardamom.
  
  Mix well and then freeze in a metal container.  As it is freezing,
  whisk it with a fork from time to time.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: INDIAN PAPADAMS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Garbanzo bean (chick-pea)
           Flour
      1 ts Cracked or coarsely ground
           Black pepper
      1 ts Ground cumin seed
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 cl Garlic, pressed
    1/4 c  Plus about 1 Tablespoon
           Water
           Cayenne for dusting tops
           Oil for frying (optional)
 
  "Papadams are delicious, spicy Indian crackers that traditionally
  require many ingredients and take days to make. They are prepared
  ahead in quantity and deep fried just before serving. This is a
  simplified version. It still requires time, but the results are worth
  it. It is not the easiest of recipes, so if you don't have a perfect
  result the first time, try again. You will be glad you did.
  
  Stir together the flour, pepper, ground cumin seed, and salt in a
  large bowl or in the food processor. Mix thoroughly until the spices
  are evenly distributed. Add the garlic and mix well. Add enough of
  the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  If necessary, add up to 1 additional Tablespoon water. The dough
  should be fairly stiff and dry. If it is too wet, it will not roll
  well.
  
  Knead the dough for about 5 minutes by hand or pulse for about 15
  seconds in the food processor. The dough should be smooth.
  
  With your hands, shape the dough into a cylinder or log about 2 inches
  thick and 6 inches long. With a sharp knife, cut the cylinder into
  1/2-inch thick slices.
  
  The next step uses oil, so do not use your pastry cloth and rolling
  pin sleeve. Place each slice on a lightly oiled surface. Lightly oil
  the top of the slice and then roll out into a very thin circle about
  6 or 7 inches in diameter. Papadams must be rolled extremely thin,
  maximum 1/16 inch. If the dough sticks to your rolling pin, gently
  pull it off. Dust the tops of each papadam with cayenne pepper.
  
  Using a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the papadams from the
  rolling surface, carefully place them on large baking sheets. The
  traditional method for preparing and frying papadams is described
  below. You can also bake them in a 300~F. oven for about 15 to 25
  minutes, or until crisp and dry. The cooking time may vary beyond
  this range depending upon the thickness and moisture in the rolled
  dough. Cool them on a rack.
  
  To prepare the papadams in an authentic manner, don't bake them. First
  allow them to dry by leaving them in the sun for a few hours or by
  placing them in a very low oven (less than 200~F.) for 1 to 2 hours,
  turning occasionally. Dry the papadams until they are just slightly
  flexible and show no moisture. They should not brown or bake,
  however. At this point, the papadams may be stacked flat and stored
  in an airtight container until needed. They  will keep for months if
  stored properly.
  
  When ready to serve, heat about 1/8 inch of oil in a large skillet.
  The oil should be hot, but not smoking. A drop of water flicked into
  the skillet should sizzle immediately. One at a time, drop the
  papadams into the hot oil. Turn the papadam when it begins to curl at
  the edges. It will quickly fry and become crisp. Remove it before it
  turns brown.
  
  Cool and drain the papadams on paper towels. Eat them immediately.
  Yield: 12.

      2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      4 ts Baking Powder
      1    Scant C Milk
 
  Mash the garlic and saute in the butter. Rub the meat with salt and
  flour and brown it well on all sides in the butter. Lay the meat on a
  bed or thin-sliced onion in a large Dutch oven or any pot with a
  tight-fitting lid. Add the butter, the spices and seasonings and pour
  the rum or wine over the meat. (A good pot roast will supply most of
  its own juices, but as it cooks pour the 1/2 C water over it to make
  an ample supply of gravy.) Cover tightly and simmer for 3 to 4 hours
  until the roast is tender. This may be done either in the oven or on
  the back of the stove. If you want carrots with the pot roast, add
  them to the pot for the last half hour of cooking and for the last 12
  minutes of cooking add the dumplings to steam in the flavors of the
  pot. When the roast is done, remove it to a hot, round platter and
  surround with the dumplings and carrots. Stir the grave until smooth,
  correcting the seasoning if necessary. Pour it over the roast; if
  fresh dill is available, cut it over the dish with a lavish hand.
  Serves 6-8

  Ice cream [I prefer vanilla]
  
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Bring milk to a boil in the top part of
  a double boiler. Stir in cornmeal and cook over hot water for 15
  minutes. Stir in molasses [I use the light variety, but I guess dark
  would work as well], and cook for 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat.
  Stir in butter, sugar, ginger, and salt. Turn into an oven casserole
  and bake 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Serve warm with ice cream.

      Title: INDIAN ROAST CHICKEN *JB
 Categories: Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Plain yogurt
      3 md Garlic cloves, minced
      2 tb Finely grated fresh ginger
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
      2 ts Ground coriander
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Turmeric
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper
      1    Chicken (3 1/2-lb)
 
  A spicy yogurt marinade lends this bird the distinctive flavor and
  texture of classic Indian tandoori chicken. Serve it with saffron
  rice, roasted onions and a creamy cucumber raita. Marinating the
  chicken in a plastic bag allows the entire bird to be coated with the
  yogurt mixture.
  
  1. In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice,
  lemon zest, coriander, cayenne, turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and
  1/4 teaspoon of black pepper; mix well. Place the chicken in a
  gallon-size plastic bag, add the marinade and turn to coat all over.
  Seal the bag. Refrigerate the chicken for at least 4 or up to 12
  hours, turning it occasionally in the bag.
  
  2. Preheat the oven to 350 B0. While the oven heats, let the chicken
  come to room temperature. Lift the chicken from the marinade and
  transfer to a roasting pan; discard the remaining marinade. Season
  the chicken with salt and pepper and roast for 25 minutes. Rotate the
  pan and roast for another 25 minutes. Increase the temperature to 400
  B0 and roast the chicken for about 35 minutes longer, or until the
  juices run clear when a thigh is pierced with a fork.
  
  3. Transfer the chicken to a platter, cover loosely with foil and let
  rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Skim the fat from the
  juices in the roasting pan and strain the juices through a coarse
  strainer; season with salt and pepper and serve with the chicken.

  yogurt--about 1/3 as much in volume as the spinach before cooking.
  
  Stir well and eat.
  
  I forgot one step: Before covering and cooking spinich, sprinkle with
  enough turmeric to make it look like dust.

 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Dried anasazi beans
      6 ea Pieces Indian Frybread,
           -- about 6" in diameter
  1 1/2 c  Mache or arugula, washed &
           -- stemmed
      1 lg Red ripe tomato, sliced
      2 ea Ripe avocados, halved &

      6 ea Green anaheim chiles
      1 lg Red bell pepper, or red
           -- anaheim chile
 
  To prepare the anasazi beans, soak overnight in water to cover. The
  next day, drain the beans and place them in a saucepan with fresh
  water to cover.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and let the beans
  simmer until the skins break, about 3 hours.  It may be necessary to
  add water as the beans cook to prevent them from burning and
  sticking. After the beans are cooked, remove from the heat and set
  aside. You should have about 3 cups cooked beans. While the beans are
  cooking, roast, seed, and devein the chiles and the pepper. Leave
  chiles whole; slice pepper lengthwise into six strips. To start
  building the tacos, place 1/2 cup cooked beans on each piece of
  frybread.  Add 1/4 cup greens per taco, followed by a red tomato
  slice. Add 4 slices avocado and 1 slice red onion, separated into
  rings. Follow with radishes and 4 golden yellow plum tomatoes per
  taco, and top with 1 roasted green chile and 2 slices roasted red
  pepper or chile. You can vary the toppings and the order in which the
  taco is built.

      2    Eggs,separated
      2 pk Vanilla pudding(3 3/8oz)
  2 1/2 c  Milk
      1 c  Whipping cream
      1 ts Almond extract
      1 cn Mandarin-orange sect.(11oz)
      1    Kiwifruit,medium
      5    Strawberries,large
    1/4 lb Grapes,green,seedless
      1    Chocolate square,unsweetened
  5 1/2 oz Apple jelly
      1 ts Water
 
  1. Whip cream. Drain mandarin-orange sections. Peel and slice
  kiwifruit. Coarsely grate chocolate square. Prepare tart shells; Into
  medium-sized bowl, measure flour and butter or margarine. With
  fingertips, blend flour and butter until mixture resembles coarse
  crumbs. In cup, beat cold water with egg yolks. Add yolk mixture to
  flour mixture, stirring to mix well. Shape pastry into a ball.
  2. Preheat oven to 400'F. On well-floured surface, with floured
  rolling pin, roll pastry 1/8"-thick. With floured 4 1/4" round cookie
  cutter, cut out 20 pastry circles, rerolling trimmings if necessary.
  Gently press each circle onto bottom and up side of fluted tart pan
  (or use twenty-four 2 1/2" muffin-pan cups, and cut circles with a 3
  1/2" round cookie cutter). With fork, prick pastry in many places.
  Arrange tart pans in 2 jelly-roll pans for easy handling. Bake 20-25
  minutes until pastry is lightly browned.
  3. In cup, beat egg whites until frothy. Quickly brush hot tart
  shells with beaten egg whites. Cool tart shells in pans on wire racks
  10 minutes. With knife, gently loosen tart shells from sides of pans;
  remove from pans; cool completely on wire racks, about 20 mintes.
  4. When tarts shells are cool, prepare cream filling. Prepare 2
  packages of instant pudding mix as label directs, but prepare both
  packages together and use only a total of only 2 1/2 cups milk. With
  rubber spatula, fold whipped cream and almond extract into pudding.
  5. Spoon filling into tart shells. Decorate some filled tart shells
  with mandarin-orange sections, some with kiwifruit, some with
  strawberries, some with grapes, and some with chocolate.
  6. Prepare glaze: In small saucepan over medium-low heat, heat apple
  jelly with water, stirring often, until jelly melts and mixture is
  smooth; brush over fruit. Let glaze dry, about 10 minutes. Cover
  tarts and refrigerate.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Favorite chili
     12    Phyllo
      6 tb Unsalted butter; melted
      1 c  Monterey jack cheese; coarse
           -----garnishes-----

  Recipe by: The Supermarket Epicure-Joanna Preuss-ISBN 0-688-08049-9 1.
  Prepare chili as directed and chill. 2. Preheat oven to 400 F. Grease
  a 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-inch jelly roll pan. 3. place 1 leaf of phyllo
  on a towel with the long edge in front of you, and brush lightly with
  melted butter. Place a second leaf on top, and brush again with
  butter. Top with a third leaf (do not brush with butter), and cut the
  stack in half crosswise. 4. Spoon about 3/4 cup chili along the near
  edge of each phyllo stack, leaving about 1-inch border uncovered on
  each side. 5. Holding the towel corners nearest you, flip the towel
  up, causing the phyllo to roll over on itself and cover the filling.
  (you can do both stacks with one flip.) Turn the edges in over the
  filling and continue to roll 1 strudel at a time to the end.
  Carefully place each strudel on the greased pan, seam side down.
  Repeat 3 more times with the remaining chili and phyllo. Brush the
  strudel tops with melted butter, place the pan in the middle of the
  preheated oven, and bake for 12 to 14 mins, until the strudels are
  crisp and golden brown. 6. If you have an attractive oven-safe
  serving platter, transfer the strudels to it, and sprinkle the cheese
  on top. (Otherwise, leave the strudels in the pan.) Return the
  strudels to the oven until the cheese melts, about 3 mins. Remove pan
  from oven, garnish the strudels, and serve 1 strudel to each guest,
  placing some olives, onions, peppers and tomatoes on each plate.

  prebaked crust. Divide sausage and 1/2 of pepperoni over crusts.
  Place green pepper, small onion, mushrooms, olives, artichoke hearts
  and crushed red pepper evenly over crusts as desired. Top with
  remaining pepperoni and cheeses. Place pizzas on baking sheets; bake
  12-14 minutes or until heated through.
  
  PIZZA CRUST DOUGH: Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, yeast, sugar and salt in
  large bowl. Add water and oil; beat with electric mixer at low speed
  1 minute. Beat at high speed 3 minutes. Stir in enough of remaining
  1/2 cup flour to form soft dough. Turn out onto lightly floured
  surface. Knead 8-10 minutes or until dough is elastic. Place in
  lightly greased bowl; turn to coat. Cover; let rise in warm place
  until double in bulk, about 45 minutes. Punch down dough; divide into
  six pieces. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Roll each piece of dough into
  a 7" circle; prick several times with fork. Cover; let rest 10
  minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 425'F. Generously grease two baking sheets; sprinkle
  with cornmeal. Place pizzas on baking sheet; bake 8-9 minutes or
  until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.
  
  Makes 6 7" crusts.

 Categories: Desserts, Pies, Cakes
      Yield: 6 Pies
 
      6 oz Plain flour
      5 oz Melted butter
      1 tb Icing (confectioners) sugar
      1 tb Water
  3 1/2 oz Pecan nuts (broken large)
      2    Eggs (size 3/medium)
      2 oz Dark brown soft sugar
      5 oz Golden syrup (corn syrup)
 
  Mix together the flour, icing sugar, water and 4 oz of the melted
  butter. (You should kneed together for a good mix).
  
  Divide between 6 x 4 inch flan tins or small bun tins and press up the
  edges (prick lightly with a fork to reduce the amount the centre
  rises)
  
  Place on a baking tray and blind bake in a preheated oven at
  190C/375F/gas mark 5 for 10 to 15 mins (until golden brown)
  
  Remove and divide the chopped pecans between the pastry cases.
  
  Whisk the eggs, then stir in the sugar, syrup and remaining 1 oz
  melted butter. Beat well and spoon into the pastry cases, filling
  almost to the top. (this makes probably 50% TOO much mixture for me)
  
  Return to the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until set and golden.
  
  Serve hot or cold with cream, creme fraishe or ice cream.
  
  Time: about an hour and a quarter for one batch. Source: Sainsbury's

      Title: INDIVIDUAL PIZZA CRUST
 Categories: Pizza, Low-fat
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Lukewarm water
      1 ts Honey
      1 tb Dry active yeast
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Semolina
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Olive oil
    1/2 c  Cornmeal
           Light vegetable oil cooking
           - spray
 
  Mix the water and honey together in a medium stainless steel bowl.
  Sprinkle the yeast on top and set it aside for about 20 minutes to
  proof, until bubbles form on the surface.  Put the flour, semolina,
  and salt into the bowl of a food processor.  Turn the machine on and
  slowly add the yeast mixture through the feed tube.  Process for
  about a minute, until a dough ball forms, drizzling a little
  additional water into the feed tube if necessary.  Continue to
  process for another 2 minutes.  Rub the surface of a large bowl with
  the olive oil.  Transfer the dough ball to the bowl and roll it in
  the oil to coat.  Cover with a towel and set the bowl aside in a warm
  place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the
  oven to 400 degrees.  Remove the dough to a work surface that has
  been dusted with the cornmeal and roll out evenly to a thickness of
  about 1/4 inch.  Cut out eight 5 1/2-inch circles, using a sharp
  knife and a saucer of that circumference.  Spray a cookie sheet with
  Pam spray and place the pizzas onto the sheet.  Bake for about 5
  minutes or until golden in color. Remove the baked crusts from the
  oven and add the toppings of your choice.

      3    Cl Garlic
      1 md Onion
      1    Root ginger

           Juice of one lemon
      2 tb Dark soy sauce; (pref. kikom
      1 ts Brown sugar
     10 fl Water
 
  Recipe by: Piers Thompson <pjt1@SCIGEN.CO.UK> If you are using dried
  chiles then soak them in hot water for 20 minutes. Roughly chop the
  garlic, onion and chiles. Peel and chop the ginger and pl in a
  liquidiser (you could probably use a food processor - I haven't
  tried) the garlic, onion, chiles, oil and shrimp paste. Blend until a
  fine paste adding a little water if necessary (avoid the fumes!).
  Cut the beef into f slices about 1/8 inch thick, 1 inch long and 1/2
  inch wide.
  
  Heat a non-stick frying pan and add the paste.  Fry for 3 minutes and
  then the beef.  Fry until the meat is browned all over. Add half the
  lemon juic the soy sauce, sugar and water. Stir, reduce the heat and
  simmer for 20-30 minutes until the beef is tender. Taste and add
  extra lemon juice if requi Add more water if necessary during
  cooking. The sauce should be quite thic when the meat is cooked.
  
  Serve with rice or noodles and quick fried cabbage with eggs (see
  recipe).
  
  Notes:  Vary the number of chiles depending on what sort of chile you
  are u and how hot you like it.  It is supposed to be very hot. I have
  also made using left over roast beef and reducing the simmering time
  to 10 minutes.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb Pork, cut into small,
           -bite-size pieces
      1    Onion, chopped
      2 tb Red peppers, crushed
      4    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 tb Lime juice
    2/3 c  Soy sauce
      3 tb Brown sugar
 
  Fry pork, onion, red peppers and garlic over high heat in a heavy
  frying pan, stirring frequently for about 20 minutes or until
  well-browned. Add lime juice, soy sauce and brown sugar. Reduce heat
  and simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Put in a covered dish and keep warm in the oven while you make the
  rice to serve it over.  This makes it easy to make the rice, and the
  pork actually browns a little more during this time.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork with lime and hot peppers -- This recipe was originally based
  on one I found in a paperback cookbook. Over the years I have adapted
  it into what you see here. It is fairly hot, but always gets rave
  reviews from everyone, even from people who normally don't like hot
  food. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.

      Title: INDONESIAN POTATO & BEEF PERKEDEL
 Categories: Indonesian, Potatoes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      2 lb Baking potatoes, boiled and
           -mashed
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
      2 ts Ground coriander
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley leaves
      1 lg Egg
      2 tb Peanut oil, plus more for
           -deep frying
      4    Shallots, finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 lb Lean ground beef.
 
  Not too long ago, there was a bit of discussion about potato
  pancakes. (I'm still smarting from all the verbal flack I got about
  my love of instant mashed potatoes... ;-} ) Here's a recipe with a
  twist from Indonesia. This is traditionally served with soto ayam++a
  kind of chicken soup.
  
  In Indonesia, these fritters are served as part of a rijstaffel
  (rice-table) or as a side dish to embellish a main course. You will
  find they work well as a delicious appetizer for a Western meal.
  
  Mix together the mashed potatoes, 1 teaspoon of the salt, half the
  pepper, the coriander, nutmeg, parsley and egg.
  
  Preheat a wok until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, the shallots
  and garlic; saute until soft.  Add beef and stir to break up clumps;
  brown until meat is no longer red, about 2 minutes. Season with
  remaining salt and pepper.  Cool.
  
  Combine the meat with the potato mixture.  Form into 16 balls and
  flatten them into cakes about 2 inches round by 1 inch thick. Set on
  a tray. Refrigerate, if not fried immediately.
  
  Pour 2 inches of oil into a preheated wok.  Heat to 365F. Add 4 or 5

      Title: INDONESIAN POTATO & BEEF PERKEDEL
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      2 lb Baking potatoes, boiled and
           -mashed
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
      2 ts Ground coriander
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley leaves
      1 lg Egg
      2 tb Peanut oil, plus more for
           -deep frying
      4    Shallots, finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 lb Lean ground beef.
 
  Not too long ago, there was a bit of discussion about potato
  pancakes. (I'm still smarting from all the verbal flack I got about
  my love of instant mashed potatoes... ;-} ) Here's a recipe with a
  twist from Indonesia. This is traditionally served with soto ayam++a
  kind of chicken soup.
  
  In Indonesia, these fritters are served as part of a rijstaffel
  (rice-table) or as a side dish to embellish a main course. You will
  find they work well as a delicious appetizer for a Western meal.
  
  Mix together the mashed potatoes, 1 teaspoon of the salt, half the
  pepper, the coriander, nutmeg, parsley and egg.
  
  Preheat a wok until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, the shallots
  and garlic; saute until soft.  Add beef and stir to break up clumps;
  brown until meat is no longer red, about 2 minutes. Season with
  remaining salt and pepper.  Cool.
  
  Combine the meat with the potato mixture.  Form into 16 balls and
  flatten them into cakes about 2 inches round by 1 inch thick. Set on
  a tray. Refrigerate, if not fried immediately.
  
  Pour 2 inches of oil into a preheated wok.  Heat to 365F. Add 4 or 5
  cakes, or as many as will fit into the pan without crowding or
  reducing the temperature of the oil. Deep fry, turning occasionally
  until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  (If preferred, the cakes may be
  pan-fried in a flat skillet.) Remove to paper towels to drain. Serve
  hot or at room temperature.
  
  Makes 15 cakes.

      Title: INDONESIAN SOUFFL OMELETTE
 Categories: Eggs/cheese, Breakfast, Brunch
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Cm. Root ginger
           - peeled and grated
      1    Clove of garlic; crushed
           Sesame oil
     75 g  Chinese cabbage; shredded
     75 g  Small button mushrooms
           - sliced
     50 g  Sweetcorn
     50 g  Mange-tout
      1    Fresh chilli
           -- de-seeded and chopped
     40 g  Dry-roasted peanuts; ground
    150 ml Thin coconut milk
      3    Eggs; separated
           Salt
           Fresh coriander leaves
           -- to garnish
 
  Serves 2-3
  
  Souffl omelettes are spectacular dishes, yet they are disarmingly
  simple to prepare. The Indonesian spicing of this dish, and the
  coconut milk which is so typical of that cuisine, make this a meal to
  remember. Serve it with a couple of salads of your choice.
  
  Soften the ginger and garlic in the oil for 2-3 minutes, then toss in
  the prepared vegetables. Stir until heated through and well coated
  with the oil, then add the ground peanuts. Stir well. Pour in the
  coconut milk and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, then mix
  in the beaten egg yolks and stir thoroughly. Season to taste.
  
  Fold in the stiffly beaten whites and pour the mixture into a large,
  well-oiled, heavy frying-pan. Cook over a very gentle heat for 8-10
  minutes until puffed and beginning to set. Brown under a hot grill
  for a minute or two to finish the cooking, and serve immediately
  garnished with fresh coriander leaves. Cut into wedges for each
  serving.

      4 md Onions - chopped
      6    Bay Leaves
      2 ts Laos**
    1/2    Bag Demerara Sugar
 
  *I use 17 oz. bottles of China Lily (a Canadian Brand) **Laos is also
  called Gallingal and can be found at Asian food/spice stores.
  
  Here's the recipe for Indonesian Soy Sauce, which I THINK is called
  Kecap Manis.  And even if it's not you might find some use for it...
  ;-}
  
  Put all the ingredients in a large pot and cook on medium till onions
  are limp.  Add sugar and bring to a boil to dissolve sugar. Strain
  and pour into bottles. I keep it in the fridge but I don't know if
  you have to.
  
  It's a very sweet Soy Sauce that may take a little getting used to
  but you will probably find that you can use it for things and not
  worry about a "salty" taste.

      1 c  Arborio rice (240g)
    1/2 ts Saffron threads
      1 md Onion, minced
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      3 tb Oil

      1 c  Plain yogurt, room
           -temperature (1/2 pt.)
           Salt & pepper
 
  It's only touted as "Indonesian-style" but what the hay...
  
  As is the case with most Southeast Asian and South African yellow rice
  dishes, the coloring agent called for here was turmeric, not saffron.
  Yogurt appears in many Indian saffron dishes, however, and I suspected
  saffron would work well here.  It does.  You can substitute California

 Categories: Indonesian, Condiment
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Bottles Regular Soy Sauce *
      3    Bottles Water
      4 md Onions, chopped
      6    Bay Leaves
      2 ts Laos **
    1/2    Bag Demerara Sugar
 
  *I use 17 oz. bottles of China Lily (a Canadian Brand) **Laos is also
  called Galingal and can be found at Asian food/spice stores.
  
  METHOD:
  
  Put all ingredients in a large pot and cook on medium till onions are
  limp. Add sugar and bring to a boil to disolve sugar. Strain and pour
  into bottles. I keep it in the fridge but I don't know if you have to.
  
  It's a very sweet Soy Sauce that may take a little getting used to
  but you will probably find that you can use it for things and not
  worry about a "salty" taste.

      Title: INFORMATION ABOUT CHILIES
 Categories: Vegetables, Chili
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No Ingredients
 
  Chilies belong to the capsicum family, as do sweet peppers, but there
  the relationship ends, for the fiery heat of the chili is in no way
  similar to its mild-flavored relation. Fresh chilies are now widely
  available and vary considerably in size, shape and heat factor. In
  principle, the fatter chilies tend to be more mild than the long,
  thin varieties, and the smaller the chili, the hotter its taste.
  Generally, the unripened, green chili is less fiery than when ripened
  and red. This is a useful guide to follow, but there are exceptions
  according to the variety, so it is wise to remember that all chilies,
  irrespective of color, shape and size, are hot, so use caution before
  adding them to a dish. Bear in mind that a little chili goes a long
  way, so add a small amount to begin with and gradually increase the
  quantity to your liking during cooking.
  
  Take care when preparing chilies - the tiny, cream-colored seeds
  inside are the hottest part and, in general, are removed before
  using. Chilies contain a pungent oil which can cause an unpleasant
  burning sensation to eyes and skin, so it's a wise precaution to wear
  rubber gloves when handling chilies and be sure not to touch your
  face and eyes during preparation. Cut off the stalk end, then split
  open the pod and scrape out seeds, using a pointed knife, and
  discard. Rinse pod thoroughly with cold running water and pat chili
  dry before chopping or slicing as required. Once this task is
  completed, always wash your hands, utensils and surfaces thoroughly
  with soapy water.
  
  Dried red chilies are sold whole and can vary in size from 1/2-3/4 to
  1-1/2-2 inches in length, so this into account when using. If a recipe
  states small dried chilies, and you only have the larger ones, adapt
  and lessen the quantity accordingly, or to taste. Dried chilies are
  usually soaked in hot water for 1 hour before draining and removing
  seeds as described above), unless a recipe states otherwise.
  
  Dried red chilies, when ground, are used to make cayenne pepper and
  combined with other spices and seasonings, also make chili and curry
  powder, and chili seasoning. They are also used in the making of
  hot-pepper sauce and chili sauces.
  
  The Harissa spice mix uses a large quantity of dried chilies and is
  very hot, so be forewarned! This is a favorite spice mix for many
  Middle Eastern dishes. Don't be tempted to add more Harissa than
  recipe states, unless you are prepared for an extremely hot dish. A
  less fiery Harissa can be made simply by removing the seeds from
  soaked chilies before crushing chilies with other ingredients.
  
  Green chilies are available canned. These are often seeded and peeled
  and taste pleasantly hot and spicy - ideal for adding to pizza
  toppings, sauces and taco fillings. Both red and green chilies also
  come pickled in jars (hot or mild/sweet) and can be found in
  delicatessens and ethnic food shops. Canned and pickled varieties
  should be drained and patted dry before using. Whether you seed the
  pickled type is up to you, just remember the seeds are the hottest
  part!

           Distilled/Cider/Rice Vinegar
           Pepper flakes
           Fermented Beans
           Kosher Salt
 
  |   Kadoya Sesame Oil For the accent oil, I choose Kadoya Sesame Oil.
  The toasting and pressing of this particular brand of sesame oil is
  done with such consistent card that I have never had a burnt-tasting
  or rancid bottle in all my years of cooking. If your market does not
  have Kadoya brand, taste the other candidates with a critical nose
  and tongue. | Marukan unseasoned rice vinegar (with green label) |
  Heinz distilled white vinegar and Heinz apple cider vinegar are my
  favorite vinegars of choice for making infusions. |   Miysukan
  unseasoned rice vinegar is another good brand. These are not the
  least expensive, but in my experience they are the most tasty, with a
  broad range of flavor in addition to the acidic bite. In the realm of
  dry and fresh aromatics used for infusing, you must also choose with
  care: | Dried red chili flakes should be red (indicating sweetness
  and fire), not brown or purple-black. They should be so pungent that
  you rear back when you smell them. The bag should contain no more
  than 25 percent seeds. |  Szechwan peppercorns should smell
  profoundly good and herbal. The bag should contain few if any black
  seeds. Twigs and tiny leaves are part of the bundle, along with a
  good-size thorn every so often (that should be picked out) | Pearl
  River Bridge Chinese fermented black beans should be moist and
  pliable to the touch. They should taste good, with a nice range of
  flavor in the after-taste. My favorite brand is Pearl River Bridge in
  a round yellow box.  Don't use beans that are hard and shriveled.
  Likewise, don't wash them before use; you want the salt they carry as
  a contribution to the infusion. | Garlic, ginger and lemongrass
  should be rock-hard fresh, with no hint of mold to the eye or the
  nose. | Scallions should be straight-standing and perky, ideally
  wearing their white beards as a sign of freshness. They should feel
  dry or pleasantly moist from the grocer's water pistol, not slimy. |
  Orange and Lemon Zest should be washed well in warm water with an
  abrasive scrubber and then rinsed squeaky-clean, even if the fruit
  came from your back yard tree. | Diamond Kosher Salt is the only kind
  I use unless a recipe specifies otherwise. It comes in a big red and
  gold box and is a feature of most good restaurant kitchens. No other
  brand, in my experience is so consistently mild and clean tasting.
  Buy a box from a neighborhood restaurant if you can't convince your
  grocer to order it. (Dorothy's note: I found Diamond Kosher Salt in
  my super market's Kosher/Jewish food section _not_ with the other
  salts and spices for sale.)

      Title: INFUSED OILS - FOUR TECHNIQUES FOR CREATING
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Informed
 
           Oil, Infused
           Homemade
 
  Here are some guidelines for making your own infused oil. Always
  sterilize the bottles into which you will put the oil. Wine bottles
  are a good choice, but you may want to use smaller containers, such
  as cruets, because the flavor of infused oil, like all oils,
  deteriorates with age. Don't use more expensive extra-virgin oil to
  make infused oils. Because you are introducing flavors into the oil,
  you do not need or want the often peppery or perfumey flavor that is
  intrinsic in fine first pressings of olives. Don't exclude grape seed
  and canola oils, especially for flavors such as ginger, mint, and
  mustard. In his book "Marinades" (Crossing Press), Jim Tarantino says
  that he uses grape seed oil for steeping fresh herbs. When he is
  heating the oil to make infusions with dried chilies, mushrooms,
  curry, dried lemon grass or other Asian spices, he prefers light
  peanut or canola oil. Pure good-quality olive oil is a good match for
  spices and herbs ~- rosemary, oregano and the like -- with
  Mediterranean character. After the flavoring ingredients are placed
  in the oil, keep the bottle in a cook, dark place while it is
  infusing. Crumple and bruise herbs such as basil before adding them
  to the oil to help the flavor and aroma to escape. These are four
  main techniques for infusing oil: | 1. Simply clean herbs (or use
  dried ones) drop them in a bottle of oil and allow to sit in a cool
  dark place for at least two weeks. This technique does not produce an
  oil with added color. |
    2.  Blanch an herb such as basil in boiling water for a second or
  two, pat dry with paper towels, puree the herb with a bit of oil and
  then add it to more oil. After a few days, strain the oil. This
  method has produced lightly tinted, highly flavorful but sometimes
  muddy-looking oil. When omitting the pureeing step, and simply adding
  the blanched herb to the oil, the result is a highly flavored,
  fragrant oil, but not one that changed color. | 3. Warm the oil in a
  microwave for a few minutes, in a saucepan over medium heat, or in a
  double boiler. You can add the infusion ingredients while warming the
  oil, or drop them in after the oil is warm. This method is speedier.
  It produces flavorful oil in a day or two. | 4. Make a paste. This
  method comes into play when using dried spices. As described by James
  Peterson in his book, "Sauces" (Van Nostrand, Reinhold $39.95),
  ground spices (as well dehydrated foods such as dried mushrooms) must
  be moistened before being combined with oil. |
         Then, if using ground spices, make a paste with an equal
  amount of water before whisking the paste into a quart of oil. Allow
  to stand for a week before straining. The author made an interesting
  cardamon oil and an orange curry oil this way.

           -shockingly pungent
    1/3 c  Beans, Black fermented
           - Chinese; coarsely chopped

      2 tb Ginger, fresh minced
  2 1/3 c  Oil, Corn or Peanut
    1/3 c  Oil, Sesame, Japanese
 
  Combine all ingredients in a heavy, non aluminum 2 to 2 1/2 quart
  saucepan. Rest a deep-fry thermometer on the rim of the pot. Over
  moderately low heat, bring the mixture to a bubbly 225 degrees to 250
  degrees, stirring occasionally. Let simmer for 15 minutes, checking
  to ensure the temperature does not rise. Remove from the heat and let
  stand until cool or overnight.
  
  Scrape the oil and solids into an impeccably clean glass or plastic
  container. Store at room temperature.
  
  Use the oil wherever you want to light a spark.  The "goop" that
  settles to the bottom is a wonderful spicy addition to sauces,
  noodles, fillings and marinades.
  
  The day I made my own hot chile oil, I swear I grew a foot as a cook!
  Not at all difficult and eminently satisfying, I recommend this
  recipe to any aspiring cook. Like grinding and brewing your own
  coffee after a lackluster life of instant, the sheer flavor and
  freshness of this chile oil will knock your socks off.

      Title: INFUSED OILS - MA LA OIL "CHINA MOON"
 Categories: Condiment, Oil, Chilies
      Yield: 2 1/2 cups
 
      1 c  Oil, Corn or Peanut
      1 c  Oil, Sesame, Japanese
    1/2 c  Scallions, green & white
           - cut in rings
     15    Ginger quarter-size coins
           - smashed
      2 tb Peppercorns, Szechwan brown
    2/3 c  Chile Flakes, dried red
           -shockingly pungent
      2 ts Salt, Kosher
 
  Combine all ingredients in a heavy, non aluminum 1 1/2 quart
  saucepan. Rest a deep-fry thermometer on the rim of the pot. Over
  moderately low heat, bring the mixture to a bubbly 225 degrees
  stirring occasionally. Let simmer for 15 minutes, checking to ensure
  the temperature does not rise. Remove from the heat and let stand
  until cool or overnight.
  
  Strain the oil without pressing the solids; then, discard the solids.
  Store the oil in an impeccably clean glass jar at cool room
  temperature.
  
  Because of the large proportion of sesame oil, this is a rich oil. A
  little bit goes a long way. A spoonful added to a salad dressing or
  brushed on the plate on which a fish will steam or on the skin of a
  just smoked or roasted bird gives an inimitable touch of lushness. If
  you are a bread baker, brush a bit on your next loaf, if you are
  tossing pasta, drizzle a bit on the noodles just before serving.

           Oil, Infused
           Homemade
 
  Experts don't agree on whether you need to refrigerate oil infused
  with herbs or other foodstuffs. If you listed to the federal and state
  governments you'd refrigerate everything you plan to eat, but some
  food scientists disagree. George York, extension food microbiologist
  emeritus in the University of California, Davis food science and
  technology department says micro-organisms -- including those that
  cause botulism -- don't grow in oil. He says that if you are using
  dried herbs "you have no problem" not refrigerating an infused oil.
  If you use fresh herbs, the only bacteria that might grow would be
  harmless lactic acid bacteria. Even garlic bulbs won't cause a
  problem, he says. York says that if you're still worried, drop the
  garlic bulb in vinegar or lemon juice overnight before putting it in
  oil. Likewise, you can rehydrate dried ingredients in water spiked
  with vinegar. You can not preserve food in oil he says, but oil that
  has, for example, a few mushrooms, garlic, peppers or whatever added
  to it doesn't require refrigeration. That said, other food safety
  experts insist that chopped garlic in oil must be refrigerated to
  prevent dangerous organisms from growing. And recently, producers of
  minced or crushed garlic in jars were forced to add citric acid to
  their product as a preservative.

  ===From the FDA National Bulletin Board Consumer Topic=======
  UNREFRIGERATED GARLIC-, SPICE-IN-OIL MIXES POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FDA
  has been receiving inquiries about proper storage of homemade and
  commercially prepared chopped garlic-in-oil, garlic- in-butter and
  garlic-in-margarine mixes.  FDA is warning consumers that such mixes,
  especially those prepared fresh at home, should be kept refrigerated.
  Left at room temperature, the mixes may cause potentially fatal
  botulism food poisoning. FDA also is cautioning dietitians and food
  service workers who plan or prepare meals at hospitals, nursing homes
  and other institutions about this matter. The following may be used
  to answer questions. Botulism is characterized by blurred or double
  vision, speech and breathing difficulty and progressive paralysis.
  FDA's warning is an alert to consumers and food service workers who
  may not know that garlic-in-oil and similar herb mixes should be kept
  refrigerated. FDA issued a similar warning in March 1989, when three
  persons were hospitalized in New York with botulism poisoning after
  consuming a commercially prepared garlic-in-oil mix that had been
  stored at room temperature despite a "Keep Refrigerated" statement on
  the label. As a result of that incident, FDA ordered manufacturers to
  stop making garlic-in-oil mixes that rely solely upon refrigeration
  for safety. FDA now requires that commercial mixes contain specific
  levels of microbial inhibitors, usually acidifying agents such as
  phosphoric or citric acid. The presence of these additives in
  commercially prepared garlic products is disclosed on their labels.
  FDA recommends that consumers not prepare any homemade spice-in-oil,
  ~margarine or -butter recipes for extended storage because the
  protective additives used in commercial mixes are not generally
  available for homemade products. Consumers are urged to refrigerate
  all such products and to dispose immediately of any products
  suspected to be spoiled or to have been stored unrefrigerated.
  Clostridium botulinum bacteria are widespread in the environment and
  may be found on various kinds of produce, including garlic, but their
  spores are harmless in an oxygen environment. However, in an
  anaerobic (oxygen-free), low-acid environment, the spores can
  proliferate and produce the toxin that causes botulism.  FDA studies
  have shown that garlic-in-oil mixtures can support Clostridium
  bacterial growth and toxin production even when very few spores are
  present.

  Boil ingredients together in a large saucepan until the mixture is
  thick and forms a ball. (Mixture should retain shape when dropped in
  a glass of cold water) Roll small amounts on board covered with sugar
  or matzah meal. Roll into heavy cigar shapes (3" long) or flatten
  with palm of the hand to 1/2" thicknesses and cut into diamond or
  square shapes. I hope that this helps and is what you have been

    1/2 c  Self rising flour
    1/4 c  Whole wheat bread flour
      1 pk Dry yeast,about 1 Tablespoon
  2 1/2 c  Warm water
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Combine the flours and yeast in a ceramic or glass bowl. Add the warm
  water and mix into a fairly thin, smooth batter. Let the mixture sit
  for three full days at room temperature. Stir the mixture once a day.
  It will bubble and rise.
  
  When you are ready to make the injera, add the baking soda and salt
  and let the batter sit for 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  Heat a small, nonstick 9 inch skillet.  When a drop of water bounces
  on the pan's surface, take about 1/3 cup of the batter and pour it in
  the skillet quickly, all at once. Swirl the pan so that the entire
  bottom is evenly coated, then return to the heat.
  
  The injera is cooked on only one side and the bottom should not
  brown. When the moisture has evaporated and lots of "eyes" appear on
  the surface, remove the injera. Let each injera cool and then stack
  them as you go along.
  
  If the first injera is undercooked, try using less of the mixture,
  perhaps 1/4 cup, and maybe cook it just a bit longer. Be sure not to
  overcook it.
   Injera should be soft and pliable so that it can be rolled or folded
  like a crepe.

      Title: INJERA (ETHIOPIAN FLAT ROUND BREADS)
 Categories: Bread/rolls, Ethiopia, Update
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           To make about 16
           -nine-inch-round breads.
      5 tb All purpose flour
      3 c  Aunt Jemima's Deluxe Easy
           -Pour Pancake Mix
    1/4 ts Backing soda
  3 1/2 c  Club soda at room
           -temperature
  1 1/2 c  Water
 
  Combine the flour, pancake mix and baking soda in a deep bowl.
  Stirring constantly with a whisk or spoon, pour in the club soda and
  water in a slow stream and continue to stir until the mixture is a
  smooth , thin cream. Strain the batter through a fine sieve set over
  a clean bowl, pressing down hard on any lumps with the back of a
  large spoon. Cook the injera in a 10 inch skillet or omelette pan
  with a non-stick cooking surface or a well-seasoned 10 inch cast iron
  skillet. Warm the ungreased pan over moderate heat until it is just
  hot enough to set the batter without browning it. To test the heat,
  pour 1 tablespoon of the batter into the centre of the pan.  The
  bottom surface should solidify immediately without becoming brown.
  For each injera, remove the pan from the heat and ladle in 1/4 cup of
  the batter. Then quickly tip the pan back and forth to cover the
  bottom evenly. Cover the pan partially and cook the bread over
  moderate heat for 1 minute, or just until the top is spongy, moist
  and dotted with tiny air holes.  The bottom should be smooth, dry and
  somewhat shiny. Do not let the bottom brown; otherwise the edges may
  become too crisp. Remove the pan from the heat and use a spatula or
  your fingers to lift the injera gently out of the pan.  Lay it on a
  plate to cool, and ladle another 1/4 cup of batter into the pan,
  tipping and spreading the batter evenly. Repeat the cooking process,
  and when the next injera is done, transfer the cooled bread to a
  platter and place the hot injera on the plate. Continue making the
  breads in the same fashion with the remaining batter. To serve,
  spread 7 or 8 injera out in a shallow or flat basket or on a large

      Title: INJERA (FLAT BREAD)
 Categories: African, Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 c  Self-rising flour
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Club soda
 
     Combine flours and baking powder in a bowl. Add club soda plus
  about 4 cups water. Mix into a smooth, fairly thin batter. Heat a
  large, non-stick skillet. When a drop of water  bounces on the pan's
  surface, dip enough batter from the bowl to  cover the bottom of the
  skillet, and pour it in quickly, all at once. Swirl the pan so that
  the entire bottom is evenly coated,  then set it back on the heat.
     When the moisture has evaporated and small holes appear on the
  surface, remove the injera. It should be cooken only on one side, and
  not too browned. If your first one is a little pasty and undercooked,
  you may need to cook a little longer or to make  the next one
  thinner. But, as with French crepes, be careful not to cook them too
  long, or you'll have a crisp bread that may be  tasty but won't fold
  around bits of stew. Stack the injera one on top of the other as you
  cook, covering with a clean cloth to prevent their drying out.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Breads
 
      3 c  Warm water
  2 1/2 c  Self rising flour;GoldMedal
      3 tb Club soda
 
  Place warm water into food blender. Add flour to water and blend,
  slowly at first, then with rapid speed. <Do in two batches unless you
  have a large and powerful blender> Remember to scrape down sides of
  bowl with rubber spatula.
  
  Place batter in 6 cup bowl and stir in the club soda.
  
  Heat 12 inch electric frying pan <SiverStone lined> to 400. Using
  ladle, pour 1/4c of batter onto one corner of the hot pan.
  Immediately tilt the pan about to cover the bottom of the pan evenly
  with the batter. Cook, uncovered, until the top of the pancakelike
  bread is filled with holes and is no longer wet.  The edges should
  begin to curl just a bit. Remove quickly with your fingers and place
  the bread on a kitchen towel. Let it cool 3 or 4 mins as you prepare
  the next bread. Place the cooled breads on a plate.
  
  Continue this process until all of the batter is used. Stack the
  cooled breads one on top of the other and cover with plastic wrap
  until dinner.

      1 pk Dry yeast,

      2 c  Warm water,
      2 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Instant potato flakes

      1 ts Salt,
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Oil,
      6 c  Flour
 
  STARTER:  Dissolve yeast in 1/2 C. of warm water. Add remaining
  ingred. and stir well. Place in glass jar, covered loosely with foil,
  plastic wrap, etc. (to allow for gas expansion). Keep at room
  temperature for 24 hrs. Then place starter in frig. for 3-5 days.
  Feed: After starter has been refrigerated 3-5 days, take out and feed
  it above mixture. Let stand out (loosely covered) all day (8-10
  hrs.). Take out 1 C. to use in making bread and return remaining
  starter to frig. Keep refrigerated from 3-5 days; feed again. After
  feeding, take out 1 C. to use in making bread, or give 1 C. to a
  friend, or throw 1 C. away. Starter must be fed again in 3-5 days.
  Bread: Mix first 5 ingred. together. Add in flour 1 C. at a time
  until thoroughly mixed. Knead until good "elastic" consistency, but
  don't over knead. Place approx. 2 Tbl. oil in bottom of large boowl;
  turn dough over so oiled side is facing up. Cover with dish towl; let
  rise until double - about 8-10 hrs. Punch down, knead again only a
  few times, mixing in flour until good consistency. Divide dough in
  half, shape into loaves. Place in ungreased loaf pans; let rise again
  (4-6 hrs.). Bake @ 350 for 25-35 min. until golden brown and loaves
  sound hollow when tapped. Cinnamon Bread: Before placing dough in
  loaf pans to rise, roll out, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with
  cinnamon and sugar. Roll up and place in loaf pan to rise. This is a
  great receipe - I've enjoyed it for years! Your starter should bubble
  a little after it has set out for the day (before you feed it). If
  not, I have added yeast to the warm water of the "feed" and added it
  in and the starter has recovered just fine! Enjoy! And let me know
  how you like it! Don in Arlington, TX 8/28 9:40 a.m.

  Variety is said to be the spice of life and, whereas for many
  millions of people throughout the world, life has been a variety of
  spices for centuries, it's only thanks to early explorers, who
  returned home with shiploads of exotic spices, that Western culinary
  art was transformed.
  
  THE BOOK OF HOT & SPICY FOODS has a collection of over 100 beautifully
  illustrated step-by-step recipes which include traditional favorites
  like Steak au Poivre, Mexican Chili con Carne, Indonesian Gado Gado
  and Creole Jambalaya, plus many Indian and Oriental dishes and lots
  of sizzling new surprises and variations on a theme. Whether it's a
  simple snack, a teatime treat or an elegant dinner party dish you're
  after, this book has a recipe for all occasions.
  
  Spices are invaluable for adding that special blend of heat or
  fragrance and pungency to all manner of savory and sweet dishes.
  Don't be daunted by those unfamiliar to you - try them, you'll never
  know what you've been missing, but bear in mind that some are
  stronger and fierier than others. If experimenting, it is wise to
  start with small amounts - you can always add more to taste at a
  later stage. And remember - the amount of spices in many of the
  following recipes are suggested as a guide, so feel free to increase
  or decrease the amounts according to personal preference.
  
  It is the chili (in its various forms) that adds heat to a dish. You
  will find instructions on how to prepare this fiery spice (without
  getting burnt!), plus many recipes using it. There is also plenty of
  information on all the other hot spices - muctard, pepper, cloves and
  ginger - plus, of course, the more fragrant, aeromatic ones like
  cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, etc. And no spice book would be complete
  without recipes for making Curry Powder, Garam Masala, Five Spice
  Powder, Mixed Spice, Pickling Spice and Harissa (a Middle Eastern
  favorite).
  
  The follwing recipes range from mild to hot or just wonderfully
  spicy. It is surely a collection to please not only hot and spicy
  food-lovers everywhere, but also tempting enough to persuade the
  "uninitiated" to sample the delights of spicy foods!

MMMMM----------------INTRODUCTION TO 1475 RECIPES---------------------
 
  DE HONESTA VOLUPATE ET VALETUDINE (OF HONEST VOLUPTUSNESS AND HEALTH)
  OR VIRTUOUS ENJOYMENT AND GOOD HEALTH) BY BARTHOLOMAEUS DE PLATINA
  Printed in roman Type in Venice 13 June 1475 THE title of Platina's
  work, as is true of many books of the period, appears in various
  forms. One variant, De obsoniis ac  honesta voluptate, can be freely
  translated as: "On meat dishes and their virtuous enjoyment." Platina
  stresses that his recipes do not lead to the sin of gluttony. So you
  can enjoy your three-inch charcoal-broiled steaks and still feel
  virtuous. This book is important not only as the first printed
  cookery text, but also as an excellent source of knowledge of daily
  life in the mid-fifteenth century, and particularly for insights into
  dietary customs of the time. Platina, I discovered, was not a cook.
  He is recorded first as a soldier and later as a distinguished
  scholar. In 1474 he presented the handwritten manuscript of his now
  famous Lives of the Popes to Pope Sixtus IV. The original is still in
  the Vatican Library. His reward was an appointment to the extremely
  important post of Librarian to the Vatican. How did this scholar come
  to write a cookbook? The clue may be found in the book itself, where
  he mentions his "good friend Martino" the chef of one of the
  Chamberlains to the Pope. They must have become acquainted at the
  Vati- can. A manuscript treatise on food and cookery written by
  Martino is in the Library of Congress. It is quite evident that
  Martino's manuscript formed the basis for Platina's book, for he says
  of his friend in Chapter VI, "which cook, by the immortals, could
  compare with my companion Martino of Como, by whom these things I
  write have for the most part been considered? You will call him
  another Carneades if you hear him discussing extemporaneously the
  things put forth here." Platina's book is rather casual in its
  approach to actual cooking, and the entries in the long table of
  contents may not guide the reader to any hint of a recipe. For
  instance, the chapter on edible birds deals with swans and storks,
  but only relates their living habits. It must be remembered, however,
  that in the fifteenth century the common people could neither read
  nor write. Books were commissioned by rich patrons who collected
  handwritten books with elaborate hand-painted illuminations. Any
  cookery manuscript would have been a carefully guarded secret,
  available only to professionals. I suppose the student apprentices
  who had to pay for their training were sworn to secrecy and learned
  not by reading but by working with their masters, who probably
  couldn't write out directions anyway. But Platina, a trained scholar
  and experienced writer, turned out a well-written book by the
  standards of his time, even though the recipes lack specific
  information. What fascinates me is that so many of the same foods we
  use today were being used then in practically the same way. Platina
  refers to eggs, pastry, bread and grains, cheese, all the vegetables,
  practically all the fruits, including cherries, grapes and eggs,
  chicken, frogs, salted meat, squid, octopus and all our modern
  spices. And his chapters of advice concerning healthful habits seem
  amazingly timely today, when exercise and recreation are considered
  of vital importance for good health. All of Platina's recipes are
  frustrating, for no quantities are given and no definite cooking
  directions appear. You were just supposed to be a "born cook" in
  those days. Have a look at these old recipes, but, for goodness
  sakes, don't try them unless you are the gambling type. Use the
  modern versions--I can guarantee them, for we have eaten them one and
  all. Source: Pepperidge Farm Cookbook, by Margaret Rudkin -----

      Title: INTRODUCTION TO SUSHI
 Categories: Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Sushi Information
 
  I wrote this for a lady in Rime Cuisine who is interested in
  discovering the wonderful world of sushi. Thought it might be of
  interest to some of the folks here (particularly timidly eating,
  portly Portlanders... ;-} ).
  
  Helen++you might try "tamago" which is a kind of sweetish egg
  omelette on the rice.  It's very good and not at all "odd". Also, I
  highly recommend "toro" and "maguro" which are used to make both
  sushi and sashimi. It's raw tuna and has an indescribably clean and
  refreshing taste. (Toro is lean and maguro is "fatty".) Chances are
  if you could taste it and not know what it was, you wouldn't even
  know it was fish. I *hated* tuna until the first time I tried it raw
  in a Japanese restaurant. "Unagi" is grilled eel and is something
  that almost everyone likes. "Kani" (cooked crab) and "Ebi" (cooked
  shrimp) are quite good and not a taste stretch at all. "Ama ebi" is
  raw shrimp and a bit more for the adventerous, but I think it's
  actually better than "Ebi".  Once again the taste is subtle and
  refreshing.
  
  I think you'll actually be surprised at how subtle the tastes of sushi
  really are.  The thing that *will* get your attention is the wasabi.
  Be very careful when you first try it as it's quite easy to o.d. on.
  It'll be easier for you if you're already a horseradish fan. I'd be
  careful about stuff with "shiso".  It's an herb somewhat like mint,
  but it can be quite startling to the uninitiated, somewhat like
  cilatro can be.
  
  BTW, there's an excellent book you might like to check out. It's
  called "Sushi", by Mia Detrick.  Paperback, 95 pages. Chronicle
  Books, San Francisco.  ISBN: 0-87701-238-5. No publication date given
  (unless you can figure it out from the ISBN number).  It's pretty
  recent though.
  
  This is a guided tour of sushi eating++the food and the etiquette.
  Not a cookbook as such, though it does have a short section on
  preparing sushi at home. Primarily, it's an introduction to the food
  with explanations of the ingredients and the most popular types of
  sushi. The illustrations are all color plates and the book is
  gorgeous. Each type of sushi is illustrated and explained.  Good
  stuff!

      1 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Cinnamon, ground
    1/4 ts Nutmeg, ground
    1/2 c  Butter (softened
           -to room temperature)
      1 c  Brown sugar (packed
           -firmly into measuring cup)
  1 1/2 c  Oats, quick-cooking
           -(uncooked)
      2 lg Eggs (lightly beaten)
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ts Almond extract
      1 c  Raisins
      1 c  Dates (chopped)
      1 c  Pecans (chopped)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Sift together flour, baking powder,
  salt, cinnamon and nutmeg until well blended.
  
  In a separate bowl, stir softened butter with brown sugar until well
  mixed.
  
  Stir sifted dry ingredients into butter-sugar mixture. Stir in dry
  oats and beaten eggs. Add vanilla and almond extracts. Mix
  thoroughly. Stir in raisins, chopped dates and chopped pecans. Mix
  well until batter is firm.
  
  Drop small dollops (each about 1 heaping teaspoon) about 2 inches
  apart onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 18 minutes in 350 degree
  F. oven until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheet, lay flat, and
  cool for 10 minutes before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicious high-fiber oatmeal drop cookies -- These oatmeal cookies
  are for cookie lovers to splurge with. Not only are they great
  tasting, but they are very high in fiber content and easy to make.
  The recipe is mine and is based on several different ideas in
  different cookbooks as how to best to make them. In fun, I call them
  "Invisible Oatmeal Cookies" because they are wont to disappear
  whenever unguarded. Enjoy.
  
  *  If any children (young or old) live within smelling distance of
  your stove, make extra cookies for when they suddenly show up for an
  unexpected visit.
  
  *  The recipe may be halved, doubled, or whatever without harm. The
  batter as well as the baked cookies freeze well. Thaw batter on
  countertop. Thaw cookies either in microwave or in oven.

      Title: IOTIAN RISOTTO (RICE & CHEESE)
 Categories: Rice, Cheese/eggs, Star trek
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -Jo Ferry cmsj69b
      4 tb Butter
  2 1/2 c  Onions; chop
  2 1/2 c  Raw long-grain rice
      1 c  Dry white wine
      5 c  Chicken broth
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 lb Swiss cheese; grate
      2 tb Butter
      7 oz Can mushrooms
      2 tb Parsley; chop
 
  Note: Captain Kirk's first visit to the Iotians came at a particularly
  turbulent time in their gang wars, so he saw nothing of their family
  life. When he returned a year later with Isak Wharton, a Federation
  economist, to supervise the reinvestment of the Federation's "cut",
  the situation was already much improved, and life was more relaxed.
  When Angela Oxmyx had the Captain, Wharton, and the Krackos over for
  dinner, this is one the things she served. Melt the butter in a
  4-quart pot and fry the onions in it until golden. Add the rice,
  stirring until it is well-coated with butter. Add the white wine and
  broth (which can be part chicken broth and part water) and salt.
  Bring to a boil, cover and simmer until the rice is tender. The
  liquid will be absorbed, but the rice will not be dry and fluffy.
  Cooking time from when the rice starts to boil until it is tender
  should be about 20 minutes. Add the Swiss cheese, stirring to mix it
  in well and to melt it. Take the pot off the heat and set aside,
  covered. Melt the butter in the saucepan and add the drained
  mushrooms. Cook them a few minutes until they are thoroughly hot. Do
  not brown them. Put the cooked rice in a large bowl, sprinkle with
  the parsley and then pour the mushrooms over all. Serve immediately.

 Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Butter (1 stick)
      1 c  Sugar
      1 cn Choc Syrup--1 lb
      4    Eggs
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Nuts, chopped opt.
           ICING RECEIPE ALSO
 
    Cream together butter and sugar till fluffy. Beat in syrup, then
  eggs one at a time. Beat in flour gradually. Fold in nuts (optional).
  Pour into greased cake pan (I use abt 9x13 pan). They do not rise
  much. Bake at 350 degrees about 30-40 mins. *Orig. receipe calls for
  jelly roll pan-- that is 15x10. Cooking time is 25 mins for this
  size. Pan will be full but they do not rise.
    Frost with the Frosting for Iowa Brownies receipe to follow. **I use
  Hersheys Choc. syrup.
    This is more of a "cake" than a brownie. And is "missing something"
  without the icing!

      Title: IOWA CHOP WITH APRICOT PECAN STUFFING
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Posted by Stewart Hopper
           -
           STUFFING MIXTURE:
      8 oz Dried apricots
    1/3 c  Brandy
    2/3 c  Hot water
    1/2 c  Onion, minced
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter
     12 oz Broken pecans (not chopped)
      1 tb Fennel seed
      1 ts White pepper
      1 ts Nutmeg
      2 oz Dried currants
      1 tb Grated orange peel
    1/4 c  Apricot jam
           5-6 whole eggs
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 lb Packaged seasoned bread
           -stuffing crumbs
           PORK:
     12    6-8oz Iowa Chops
           3 to 4 tb vegetable oil
           OPTIONAL FLAMBE:
      1 c  Brandy
 
  Soak apricots in brandy and water for 1/2 hour. Drain, reserving
  liquid, and chop apricots finely. Place together in a large bowl.
  
  Saute onions in butter until tender. Add to apricots and reserved
  liquid; set aside to cool slightly.
  
  Add remaining stuffing ingredients (except the bread stuffing crumbs)
  in order given. Mix well to break up the eggs.
  
  Add bread crumbs and mix well.  Refrigerate stuffing while preparing
  pork.
  
  Make a pocket in the meat by slicing horizontally toward the bone
  halfway up the thickness of the chop. Stuff each chop with about 1/3
  cup of the prepared stuffing, then sear both sides of the chop in a
  skillet with the vegetable oil in it.  Arrange the chops in a baking
  pan, cover, and bake for 35-40 minutes in a 350 degree oven. (when
  pork tests 160 internally, it is done)
  
  There will be about 2 quarts of stuffing left, which should be served
  as a side dish. Place it in a greased baking dish and bake uncovered
  in the oven with the pork.
  
  Heat brandy in a small saucepan until hot but not boiling. Pour hot
  brandy into the hot baking pan with the meat, then touch with a
  lighted match. The brandy will flame up, and at this point you can
  carry the meat dish to the table and place it on a heavy trivet. The
  flames will subsidde after a minute or so, but the baking dish will
  be too hot to pass, so the chops must be served by the host or
  hostess.

  My friend Giti Hormozyari served me this refreshing mixture with a
  slice of bread and a glass of iced tea on a hot, July day. I was
  exhausted, ready to faint from the heat and this revived me
  completely. Traditionally, it is served with meats but it is
  wonderful straight out of jar with bread. The large quantity of mixed
  herbs sets it apart from a usual relish.
  
  Mix the vegetables, herbs and salt together, cover with the vinegar.
  
  Refrigerate at least 25 days before using. If you omit eggplant, the
  relish will ready in 3 or 4 days.
  
  Makes 6 to 7 cups.

      1 tb Salt
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Peel beets, add to water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Cook
  until done, about 45 minutes. Add salt. Remove beets from water and
  set aside to cool.
  
  Peel potatoes and cut into 1/8s. Add to beet water. Cook until almost
  done.
  
  Meanwhile, chop onion and bell pepper. If you would like to spice it
  up add a couple of Jalapenos. (They would never do this in Russia.)
  Grate carrots. Finely chop garlic. Saute vegetables in oil until
  tender. Add tomato paste and just enough water to make a thick sauce.
  Add sugar and cook an additional five minutes.
  
  Coarsely grate cooled beets.
  
  Coarsely chop 1/4 of a head of cabbage and add to potatoes and beet
  water. Boil until the cabbage is tender, about 15 minutes. Add
  vegetables and vinegar. Taste and correct for salt.
  
  Serve in soup bowls with a dollop of sour cream.

MMMMM-----------------------1 1/2 LB LOAF----------------------------
  1 1/8 c  Water
      3 c  Bread flour
      3 ts Gluten
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      3 tb Sugar
    3/4 ts Dried lemon peel
    3/4 ts Ground allspice
  1 1/2 tb Butter
      2 tb Dry milk
      2 ts Red Star Active Dry Yeast
    3/4 c  Raisins
 
  Put all ingredients in bread pan in order of manufacturer directions.
  
  This makes a dense medium size loaf (6-7 inches tall). For a fluffier
  taller loaf, increase yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons.
  
  Have ingredients at room temperature.  If necessary, warm water and
  butter in microwave for 50-60 seconds on high.
  
  For my Hitachi 101 add 1/4 cup raisins 4 minutes into first cycle. Add
  remaining raisins just after resting period and as second kneading
  begins.
  
  Crust color: medium Bread Cycle: Bread or Mix Bread
  
  This has been a successful loaf in my Hitachi B101. Other makes of
  bread machines will have to make some changes according to their own
  machines.
  
  According to a close Irish friend, this does taste and look like the
  bread that she grew up with in Ireland.

      4 c  Stone Ground

      2 c  White flour
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
      2 c  Buttermilk or sweet milk
 
  Mix the whole wheat flour throughly with the white flour, salt, and
  soda.
  
  Make a well in the center and gradually mix in the liquid. Stir with a
  wooden spoon. You may need lass, or more liquid - it depends on the
  absorbent quality of the flour. The dough should be soft but
  managable.
  
  Knead the dough into a ball in the mixing bowl with your floured
  hands. Put on a lightly floured baking sheet and with the palm of
  your hand flatten out in a circle 1 1/2 inches thick. With a knife
  dipped in flour, make a cross through the center of the bread so that
  it will easily break into quarters when it is baked.
  
  Bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees
  and bake a further 15 minutes.
  
  If the crust seems too hard, wrap the baked bread in a damp tea cloth.
  Leave the loaf standing upright until it is cool.
  
  The bread should not be cut until it has set - about 6 hours after it
  comes out of the oven.

  it and render it down in a heavy casserole. Peel onions and potatoes,
  scrape carrots. Cut the meat into 8 pieces; only excess fat is cut
  away. Bones need not be removed.  Cut the carrots and onions in
  quarters. Toss the meat in the hot fat until its color changes;
  repeat with onions and carrots. Add stock and season carefully.  Put
  whole potatoes on top. Simmer gently until the meat is cooked,
  approximately 2 hours. Pour off the cooking liquid: degrease it, and
  reheat in a saucepan.  Check seasoning. Then swirl in butter, chives,

     12    Squares (1-ounce) semisweet
           -baking chocolate
           Powdered sugar
 
  Mousse: Whisk eggs and sugar in large metal bowl. Set bowl over
  saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch
  water) and whisk constantly until candy thermometer registers 160F.,
  about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Using electric mixer,
  beat egg mixture until cool and very thick, about 10 minutes. Place
  chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water; stir until
  melted and smooth. Remove chocolate from over water. Cool to luke
  warm. Combine cream and Irish cream liqueur in medium bowl; beat to
  stiff peaks. Pour luke warm melted chocolate over egg mixture and
  fold together. Fold in cream mixture. Cover and chill until set, at
  least 4 hours or overnight.
  
  Syrup: Combine sugar and water in small saucepan. Stir over low heat
  until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to boil. Remove from
  heat. Mix in whiskey. Cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and
  let stand at room temperature.)
  
  Cake: Preheat oven to 350 B0F. Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan
  with 2-3/4-inch high sides. Line bottom with parchment paper. Using
  electric mixer, beat eggs, sugar, espresso powder and salt in large
  bowl until mixture thickens and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when
  beaters are lifted, about 8 minutes. Sift 1/3 of flour over and
  gently fold into egg mixture. Repeat 2 more times (do not overmix or
  batter may deflate.) Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until tester
  inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool cake
  completely in pan on rack. Run small sharp knife around pan sides to
  loosen cake. Release pan sides. Turn out cake. Remove pan bottom.
  Peel off parchment. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap cake in
  plastic and chill.)
  
  Assembly: Using serrated knife, cut cake horizontally into 3 layers.
  Place bottom cake layer on platter. Brush with 3 tablespoons syrup.
  Spread 2 cups mousse over. Top with second cake layer. Brush with 3
  tablespoons syrup. Spread 2 cups mousse over. Top with third cake
  layer, cut side down. Brush with 3 tablespoons syrup. Spread
  remaining mousse over top and sides of cake. Refrigerate cake while
  preparing chocolate bands.
  
  Chocolate Bands: Line large baking sheet with foil and set aside.
  Place another large sheet of foil on work surface; top with waxed
  paper strips, spacing apart. Stir chopped semisweet chocolate and
  vegetable shortening in heavy small saucepan over low heat until
  melted and smooth. Pour half of melted chocolate down center of each
  waxed paper strip. Using metal icing spatula, spread chocolate to
  cover strips evenly and completely, allowing some chocolate to extend
  beyond edges of paper strips. Using fingertips, lift strips and place
  on clean foil-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate just until chocolate
  begins to set but is still very flexible, about 2 minutes. Remove
  chocolate bands from refrigerator. Using fingertips, lift 1 band from
  foil. With chocolate side next to cake, place band around side of
  cake; press gently to adhere (band will be higher than cake). Repeat
  with second chocolate band, pressing onto uncovered side of cake so
  that ends of chocolate bands just meet (if ends overlap, use scissors
  to trim any excess paper and chocolate). Refrigerate until chocolate
  sets, about 5 minutes. Gently peel off paper. Refrigerate cake.
  
  Chocolate curls: Line baking sheet with foil. Unwrap 1 square of
  chocolate. Place chocolate on its paper wrapper in microwave. Cook on
  High just until chocolate begins to soften slightly, about 1 minute
  (time will vary depending on power of microwave). Turn chocolate
  square onto 1 side and hold in hand. Working over foil-lined sheet,
  pull vegetable peeler along sides of chocolate, allowing chocolate
  curls to fall gently onto foil. Form as many curls as possible.
  Repeat process with remaining chocolate squares. Place curls
  decoratively atop cake, mounding slightly. (Can be prepared 1 day
  ahead. Refrigerate cake.) Sift powdered sugar over chocolate curls
  before serving cake.

  Note: When buying mussels look for small ones that have tightly closed
  shells - a sign that they are alive and thus fresher.
   Place mussels, wine and fish stock in a stock pot. Add chopped
  vegetables. Cover and shake to stir contents. Cook on high heat 4 to
  5 minutes. After 5 minutes shake pot again, remove lid and strain
  contents into a collander, catching liquid in a bowl. Then strain
  soup liquid again through a wire mesh strainer into a saucepan. Over
  high heat, boil and reduce soup for 5 minutes.
   Meanwhile, remove the mussel meat from most of the shells, leaving
  some mussel shells intact for serving as a side dish with the chopped
  vegetables.
   Pour the heavy cream into reduced soup. Whisk while maintaining the
  high heat. Add mussel meat slowly. Whisk gently. Then continue to
  stir with a soup ladle until it boils.
   Ladle soup into soup bowls. Add sprigs of chervil to top of soup for

  medium speed with electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add
  eggs, potatoes and 1/2 cup flour, or enough flour to make a thick
  batter. Stir in raisins and enough additional flour to make a soft
  dough. Turn out onto floured board. Knead until smooth and elastic,
  about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning dough to grease.
  Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down.  Turn out
  onto lightly floured board. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Shape
  each piece into a slender loaf, about 8 1/2 inches long. Put 2
  loaves, side by side, in each of 2 greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 inch
  loaf pans. Cover. Let rise in warm place, free from draft until
  doubled in bulk.  Bake in preheated 375 F oven for 35 minutes, or
  until done. Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.

  make it up to about 1/2 liter. Heat and pour over the chicken.  Cover
  and cook in a moderate oven (350C) for about an hour. . Meanwhile,
  cut the potatoes into thick slices and blanch them in boiling water,
  or steam them for about 5 minutes. Toss them in seasoned flour and
  add them to the casserole, adding a little more of the giblet stock
  if needed.  Cover with buttered wax paper and continue cooking for
  another 1/2 hour, taking off the paper for the last few minutes for
  browning.

      Title: IRISH SODA BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Irish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/4 c  Sour milk; to 2 1/2 cups
 
  Calories per serving:  154             Approx. Cook Time: 1:00
  
  "Sour milk" is milk that has had a couple of teaspoons of buttermilk
  stirred into it, has been put in a scalded container and wrapped in a
  towel, and left in some peaceful corner at about 75 degrees F for 24
  hours. The original Irish name is *bainne clabhair*, "clabbered
  milk", or "bonnyclabber" as the Scots have anglicized it. The flavor
  isn't *quite* as tart as buttermilk, but there's enough acid to make
  the bicarb react correctly.  If you don't have time to do sour milk,
  buttermilk will do perfectly well.  Sweet milk doesn't work as well,
  and your bread may not rise correctly: if you're going to use sweet
  milk, use baking powder instead of bicarbonate of soda.
  
  First, decide whether you're making farl or cake.  If farl, find your
  heaviest frying pan (cast iron is best) and put it on to preheat at a
  low-medium heat. (You're going to have to experiment with settings.
  Farl should take about 20 minutes per side to get a slight toasty
  brown.) If making cake, preheat the oven to 450 F and find a baking
  sheet. Full preheating is vital for soda bread.
  
  Sift the dry ingredients together several times to make sure the soda
  is evenly distributed.  Put them in a good big bowl (you want
  stirring room) and make a well in the center. Pour about half the
  buttermilk or sour milk or whatever in, say about a cup and a
  quarter, and start stirring. You are trying to achieve a dough that
  is raggy and very soft, but the lumps and rags of it should look
  dryish and "floury", while still being extremely squishy if you poke
  them. Add more liquid very sparingly if you think you need it. Blend
  until the whole mass of dough has become this raggy consistency.
  
  Then turn the contents of the bowl out immediately onto a lightly
  floured board, and start to knead. The chief concern here is speed:
  the chemical reaction of the bicarb with the buttermilk started as
  soon as they met, and you want to get the bread into the oven while
  the reaction is still running on "high". DON'T OVERKNEAD. You do not
  want the traditional "smooth, elastic" ball of dough you would expect
  with a yeast bread; you simply want one that contains almost
  everything that went into the bowl, in one mostly cohesive lump.  You
  should not spend more than a minute or so kneading...the less, the
  better. You *don't* want to develop the gluten in the flour.  If you
  do, you'll get a tough loaf. Once you're done kneading, shape the
  bread. For cake, flatten the lump of dough to a circle about 6-8
  inches in diameter, and put it on the baking sheet. Then use a very
  sharp knife to cut a cross right across the circle: the cuts should
  go about halfway down through the sides of the circle of dough, so
  that the loaf will "flower" properly.
  
  If you're making farl, flatten the dough ball out to a circle big
  enough that the farls are about 3/4 inch thick. Too thick, and they
  won't bake properly.  Then use the same very sharp knife to cut the
  circle of dough into four wedges.  Try not to crush or compress the
  dough where you cut it (if the knife is sharp enough, you won't).
  Then bake. When putting cake in the oven, handle it lightly and don't
  jar it: the CO2 bubbles are a little vulnerable at this point of the
  process. Let it alone, and don't peek at it. It should bake for 45
  minutes at 450F. If making farl, dust the hot griddle or frying pan
  with a little flour, and put the farls in gently. The cut edges
  should be 1/2 inch or so apart to allow for expansion. Give the farls
  20 minutes on a side; they should be a sort of mocha-toasty color
  before you turn them.  Keep an eye on the heat -- they scorch easily.
  The heat should be quite "slow". The farls will rise to about twice
  their original height. If you're making cake:  At the end of 45
  minutes, pick up the loaf and tap the bottom.  A hollow sound means
  it's done. For a very crunchy crust, put on a rack to cool. For a
  softer crust, wrap the cake in a clean dishcloth as soon as it comes
  out of the oven.

      Title: IRISH SODA BREAD #1
 Categories: Irish, Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
  1 1/4 c  Buttermilk:  to 2 1/2 c *
 
  * You will need somewhere between these two amounts of buttermilk,
  depending on how much liquid your flour tends to absorb. Try to avoid
  using regular milk: if you must, use baking powder instead of
  bicarbonate of soda. -- Lightly grease a heavy skillet (if making
  "soda farl", the flat version of soda bread) or preheat the oven to
  450 F (if making "soda cake", the round, more breadlike version.)
  Sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl; make sure the
  soda is evenly distributed. Make a well in the center of the dry
  mixture and add about half the buttermilk. Stir until you have a
  raggy dough that is very squashy but which looks more or less dry.
  Add more liquid sparingly until you achieve this texture. Blend until
  all the flour has achieved this consistency; then turn out
  immediately onto a lightly floured board and knead ***for no more
  than a minute or a minute and a half***. Overkneading makes this
  bread very tough, and it's very easy to overdo it. If making soda
  cake, shape the dough into a circle about 8-9 inches across and about
  an inch and a half thick. Cut a cross about on the top, about half an
  inch deep, and place on a floured baking sheet. Bake at 450 F for
  45-50 minutes. If making soda farl, shape the dough into a circle
  about 9 inches by one inch thick and cut into four wedges or "farls":
  place in the preheated skillet, with cut edges about half an inch
  apart. Cook slowly on the stovetop over low-to-medium heat: it should
  take about 20 minutes for the farls to puff up and turn a light brown
  on the pan side. Turn them and cook for another 20 minutes. -- For a
  softer crust on either soda cake or soda farl, wrap in a dishtowel
  after baking. -- For more information on making sodabread and its
  variations, please see the file "SODABRED.TXT" included with this

      Title: IRISH SODA BREAD (WITH VARIANT FOR SPOTTED DO
 Categories: Ethnic, Irish, Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      6 c  All purpose flour
      2 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Baking powder
      3 tb Cornstarch
      2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
  2 1/2 c  Buttermilk ***

MMMMM--------------------ADD FOR "SPOTTED DOG-------------------------
    1/2 c  Raisins or sultanas
 
  ***  may substitute 2 1/2 cup water and 10 tablespoons buttermilk
  powder.
  
  Preheat Oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Add all of the dry ingredients in a large bowl and mix very well. (If
  making Spotted Dog variant, then add raisins.) Pour all of the
  buttermilk into the bowl at once and stir, using a wooden spoon, just
  until a soft dough is formed.  Do not try to make it smooth at this
  point. Pour the contents of the bowl out onto a plastic counter and
  knead for a minute or so until everything comes together. You may
  need to add a bit more flour depending on humidity.  The dough should
  be smooth, not sticky.
  
  Divide the dough into two portions and shape each into a round loaf,
  pressing the top down a bit to just barely flatten it. Place the
  loaves on a large ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle some additional
  flour on the top of each loaf and, using a sharp paring knife, make
  the sign of the Cross in slashes on the top of each.
  
  Allow the loaves to rest for 10 minutes and then bake on the middle
  rack of the oven for 40 minutes, or until the loaves are golden brown
  and done to taste.
  
  Cool on racks.

  close Irish friend gives her stamp of approval on this as being an
  authentic Irish soda bread.  She supplied the "Spotted Dog" variant.

      Title: IRISH SODA BREAD *** (VGXB82A)
 Categories: Breadmaker, Ethnic, Fruits, Brunch, Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  2 1/4 c  Bread flour
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Butter (I use canola oil)
    1/2 c  Raisins (I add a few more)
      2 tb Caraway seeds
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Buttermilk
  1 1/2 ts Dry yeast
 
  One thing I learned from reading the Electric Bread book is that you
  can stop your machine after the first rise and start over again and
  get a nicer loaf. (More rising time that way!) Here's the recipe for
  Irish Soda Bread from my Panasonic Breadbakery Book: (It's our
  favorite!!) Bettie, TX 02/17 11:36 pm CST

      Title: IRISH SODA BREAD 2
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 8in loaf
 
      1 tb Butter, softened
      4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
 
  Preheat the oven to 425.  With a pastry brush coat a baking sheet
  evenly with the tablespoon of softened butter. Sift the flour, soda
  and salt together into a deep mixing bowl. Gradually add 1 cup of the
  buttermilk, beating constantly with a large spoon until the dough is
  firm enough to be gathered into a ball . If the dough crumbles, beat
  up to 1/2 cup more buttermilk into it by the tablespoon until the
  particles adhere.
  
  Place the dough on a lightly floured board and pat and shape it into
  a flat circular loaf about 8" in diameter and 1 1/2 " thick. Set he
  loaf on the baking sheet. Then with the tip of a small knife cut a
  1/2" deep X into the dough,dividing the top of the loaf into quarters.
  
  Bake the brad int the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes or
  until the top is golden brown.
  
  There are a couple of variations on this.  You can add 1 cup currants
  or raisins with the flour.  Also you can sprinkle the top of the loaf
  with caraway seeds.

      Title: IRISH SODA BREAD WITH HERBS
 Categories: Quick bread
      Yield: 1 Round loaf
 
           -Sue Woodward
           FROM:  THE TRELLIS COOKBOOK
      4 c  Plus 1 tbsp bread flour
      1 tb Fresh dill; chopped
      1 tb Fresh tarragon; chopped
      1 tb Fresh thyme; chopped
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1    Egg yolk
      1 tb ;water
           VARIATIONS:
           SCALLION SODA BREAD:
    1/4 c  Scallions; thinly sliced,
           -instead of herbs
           RAISIN SODA BREAD:
    1/3 c  Raisins; instead of herbs
           CARAWAY SEED SODA BREAD
      2 tb Caraway seeds; instead of
           -herbs
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  In the bowl of an electric mixer
  fitted with a paddle, combine 4 cups flour, the chopped herbs, baking
  powder, salt, and baking soda (breaking up any lumps). Mix on low
  speed for 2 minutes.  Place the buttermilk and vegetable oil in a
  stainless steel bowl and whisk gently to combine. Gradually add the
  buttermilk mixture to the combined dry ingredients while mixing on
  low speed and continue to mix until the dough forms a ball, 30 to 40
  seconds. Scrape the dough away from the paddle and turn the dough
  ball over. Mix on low speed for an additional 30 seconds.
  
  Flour a clean, dry surface with the remaining tbsp flour. Transfer the
  dough ball to the floured surface and knead with the heels of your
  hands until smooth. Form the dough into a round loaf. Pinch a small
  handful of dough and gently twist, being careful not to tear the
  dough from the loaf. Place the loaf, pinched side down, on a baking
  sheet lined with parchment paper.
  
  Whisk the egg yolk with 1 tbsp water, then lightly brush the mixture
  over the top of the loaf.  Score the loaf by cutting a 1/4" deep "X"
  into the top.  Bake the loaf in the preheated oven for 50 to 55
  minutes. The bread is done if a hollow sound is heard when the bottom
  is tapped with your finger.  Allow the bread to cool to room temp
  before slicing.
  
  Notes - the dough must be kneaded vigorously by hand; this should take
  about 2 minutes.  Pinching and twisting the loaf to form a base will
  give the finished bread a tighter and taller shape. This procedure is
  not necessary; however, the finished loaf will be much flatter if the
  base is not pinched and twisted as suggested. Rather than using dried
  herbs, if fresh herbs are not available, use an equivalent amount of
  chopped spinach. Author - Marcel Desaulniers

 Categories: Irish, Lamb
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Lamb neck chops
      4    Med-sized onions
      1    Lamb fat or beef dripping
      1    Salt and pepper
      1 tb Chopped parsley

      1 tb Butter
      4    Potatoes
  2 1/2 c  Stock or water
      1 tb Chopped chives
 
  Directions: Shred some of the lamb fat and render it down in a heavy
  casserole.  Peel onions and potatoes, scrape carrots. Cut the meat
  into 8 pieces;  only the excess fat is cut away. Bones need not be
  removed. Cut the carrots and onions in quarters. Toss meat in fat
  until color changes, and repeat with onions and carrots. Add stock
  and season carefully. Put whole potatoes on top. Simmer gently until
  the meat is cooked, 2 hours approx. Pour off the cooking liquid.
  Degrease, and reheat in another saucepan. Check seasoning. Then swirl
  in butter, chives, parsley, and pour back over stew.

      Title: IRISH STEW (2) [BIDDY WHYTE LENNON]
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Stewing lamb or mutton
      2 x  Large onions
      3 lb Potatoes
      1 x  Large bunch fresh parsley
      2 tb Chopped fresh thyme
      1 x  Water
      1 x  Salt and fresh black pepper
 
  Peel the onions and slice them into rounds.  Peel the potatoes as
  thinly as possible.  Leave them whole unless they are very large. Cut
  the meat into good-sized pieces.  Small chops can be left whole,
  larger ones divided in two.  Place a layer of onions on the bottom of
  a heavy casserole, and the meat on top of them. Sprinkle chopped
  thyme and parsley generously, and season well.  Layer the rest of the
  onions with the potatoes. Sprinkle thyme and parsley again at the
  last. The amount of water you need to add depends on how good the
  seal is between your pot and its lid, and whether you like a "wet" or
  "dry" stew. You will certainly not need more than two cups, and I use
  barely one. Bring the water to a boil, cover as tightly as possible,
  and place in a preheated oven at 300F for 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Keep an
  eye on it towards the end, and adjust the gravy by adding a little
  water if you think it too dry.  A good stew should have some gravy,
  but should not be flooded by it. "Floury" potatoes will dissolve into
  the gravy, "waxy" ones will not.  I tend to use a mixture.  Serve
  very hot with more fresh chopped parsley sprinkled on top. White soda
  bread to mop up the gravy.

  potatoes and onions are soft. Serve in soup plates with a sprinkling
  of parsley on top, and drink beer with with if you'd like. Irish stew
  always benefits from being cooked the day before and allowed to cool
  thoroughly. You may refrigerate. Skim off any fat and reheat the stew
  before serving.

 Categories: Main dish, Ireland, Soups/stews, Casseroles, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
    1/2 c  Frozen tofu
      1 sm Onion
      6 oz Potatoes
      1 sm Carrot
    1/2 ts Yeast extract
    2/3 c  Vegetable stock or water
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour -=PLUS=-
      2 tb Whole wheat flour
      1 pn Sea salt
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/8 c  Vegan margarine
           Soymilk as required
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Water
      1 ts Cider vinegar
      1 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Pour boiling water over the tofu, cover if possible, and leave for 10
  to 15 minutes.
  
  Chop the onion.  Dice the potatoes and carrot into small pieces. Add
  the yeast extract to the stock or water and bring to the boil in a
  saucepan. Add the onions and potatoes, lower heat, and leave to
  simmer for 7-10 minutes.  Add the carrots and cook for a further 4-5
  minutes.
  
  While the vegetables are cooking put the 1/2 cup flour in a bowl and
  mix in salt and baking powder.  Cut in the margarine, then pour in
  enough soy milk (about 2 tablespoons) to make a soft dough. Divide
  the dough into four balls.
  
  Put the soy sauce, water, and vinegar into a small bowl. Drain the
  tofu and squeeze it gently to extract excess liquid. Cut it into
  small dice. Put the dice into the bowl with the soy sauce mixture and
  stir it round; the liquid should be absorbed rapidly by the tofu.
  
  Spread the 2 tablespoons flour on a plate and turn the tofu cubes in
  it. Heat the oil in a skillet and stir-fry the tofu cubes until
  lightly browned.
  
  Add the tofu cubes to the vegetable mixture and turn into an oven
  dish. Flatten the dough balls and place them on top. Place in a 435F
  (220C) Gas Mark 7 oven for 15 minutes and serve immediately.

      Title: IRISH STEW [BIDDY WHYTE LENNON]
 Categories: Lamb/mutton, Stews, Irish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Stewing lamb or mutton
      2 lg Onions
      3 lb Potatoes
      1 bn Parsley, fresh; large
      2 ts Thyme, fresh; chopped
           ;Water
           Salt & pepper
 
  Peel the onions and slice them into rounds.  Peel the potatoes as
  thinly as possible.  Leave them whole unless they are very large.
  
  Cut the meat into good-sized pieces.  Small chops can be left whole,
  larger ones divided in two. Place a layer of onions on the bottom of
  a heavy casserole, and the meat on top of them. Sprinkle chopped
  thyme and parsley generously, and season well. Layer the rest of the
  onions with the potatoes.  Sprinkle thyme and parsley again at the
  last. The amount of water you need to add depends on how good the
  seal is between your pot and its lid, and whether you like a "wet" or
  "dry" stew. You will certainly not need more than two cups, and I use
  barely one. Bring the water to a boil, cover as tightly as possible,
  and place in a preheated oven at 300F for 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Keep an
  eye on it towards the end, and adjust the gravy by adding a little
  water if you think it too dry. A good stew should have some gravy,
  but should not be flooded by it. "Floury" potatoes will dissolve into
  the gravy, "waxy" ones will not. I tend to use a mixture. Serve very
  hot with more fresh chopped parsley sprinkled on top. White soda
  bread to mop up the gravy.
  
  "There are more arguments about what makes a real Irish stew than
  about any other recipe in the repertoire. Some people claim that if
  you put carrots in it, it's not an Irish stew any more.  Others say,
  leave the carrots in, but no parsnips! -- and the arguments go on."

      Title: IRISH WHISKEY CAKE
 Categories: Irish, Desserts, Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      8 oz Raisins
           Grated rind of 1 lemon
    150 ml Whiskey
      6 oz Softened butter
      3    Eggs
      6 oz Soft brown sugar
      6 oz Plain flour
      1 pn Salt
      1 pn Ground cloves
      1 ts Baking powder

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
           Juice of 1 lemon
      8 oz Confectioners' sugar
           Warm water as needed
           Crystallized lemon slices*
 
  *As garnish, if desired.  -- Put the raisins and grated lemon rind
  into a bowl with the whiskey, and leave overnight to soak. Grease a
  7-inch cake pan, and line the bottom with parchment; preheat oven to
  350F. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Separate the
  eggs and sift the flour, salt, cloves and baking powder into a bowl.
  Beat the yolks into the butter and sugar one by one, including a
  spoonful of flour and beating well after each addition. Gradually add
  the whiskey and raisin mixture, alternating with the remaining flour.
  Do not overbeat at this stage. Finally, whisk the egg whites until
  stiff and fold them into the mixture with a metal spoon. Turn into
  the prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven for about 1 1/2
  hours, or until well risen and springy to the touch ~- or test with a
  skewer: when it comes out clean, the cake's ready. Turn out and cool
  on a wire rack. .
   Meanwhile, make the icing by mixing the lemon juice with the sieved
  confectioners' sugar and just enough water to make a pouring
  consistency. Put a dinner plate under the cake rack to catch the
  drips, and pour the icing over the cake a tablespoonful at a time,
  letting it dribble naturally down the sides.  Don't worry if a lot of
  it ends up on the plate underneath ~- just scoop it up and put it on
  top again.  When the icing has set, it can be decorated with
  crystallized lemon slices if you like.

      Title: IRISH WHISKEY SODA BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------BREAD--------------------------------
      4 c  Flour, all purpose
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking Soda
    1/4 c  Butter, chilled
      1 c  Raisins or currants (option)
    1/2 c  Honey, liquid
    1/4 c  Irish Whisky or buttermilk

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      2 ts Irish Whisky
      2    Ilk
 
  BREAD:  In large bowl, combine flour, salt and baking soda. With
  pastry blender or two knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles
  coarse crumbs. Stir in raisins or currants (if using). In separate
  bowl, combine buttermilk, honey and whisky.  Add all at once to dry
  ingredients; stir just until no dry spots remain. Turn dough out onto
  lightly floured surface. Knead lightly 1 minute (too much handling
  will toughen loaves, while too little will inhibit rising.)  Divide
  dough in half and shape each half into an 8 in (20 cm) round. Place
  in two greased 8 in (1.2 L) round cake pans. With floured knife, cut
  a cross 1/2 in deep in each loaf. GLAZE: In small bowl, combine
  whisky and milk. Brush loaves with glaze.
   Bake in 350F (180C) oven 35 to 40 minutes or until loaves sound
  hollow when tapped on bottoms.  Remove from pans; let cool on wire
  racks. Cut into wedges.

      Title: IRISH WHOLE WHEAT SODA BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Quickbreads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 c  Flour, whole wheat
      1 c  Flour, all purpose
      1 tb Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
    3/4 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk, yogurt, or milk
           -soured with lemon juice
 
  Combine the dry ingredients and mix thouroughly to distribute the
  soda and baking powder, then add enough buttermilk to make a soft
  dough but firm enough to hold its shape. Knead on a lightly floured
  board for 2 or 3 minutes, until quite smooth and velvety. Form into a
  round loaf and place in a well buttered 8 inch cake pan or on a well
  buttered cookie sheet. Cut a cross on the top of the loaf with a very
  sharp floured knife. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 35-40 minutes,
  or until the loaf is nicely browned and sounds hollow when rapped
  with the knuckles. (The cross will have spread open which is
  characteristic of soda bread.) From _Beard on Bread_.

      Title: IRISH WHOLE-GRAIN SODA BREAD (LACTO)
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      3 c  Whole wheat flour,
           Preferably stone ground
      1 c  All-purpose flour, plus
           Extra for working dough
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Old fashioned rolled oats
      2 c  Buttermilk
      2 tb Dark molasses or black
           Treacle
 
  This version, flavored with old-fashioned rolled oats and dark
  molasses, is similar to the soda bread served at Ballymaloe House in
  County Cork, Ireland.  Bake the bread early in the day and reheat it
  just before the guests arrive.
  
  Thoroughly combine ww and all-purpose flours, baking soda and salt in
  large bowl. Stir in oats and make well in center.
  
  Combine buttermilk and molasses in separate bowl. Pour mixture into
  flour well and gradually work into flour with fingers or spoon.
  
  Knead dough lightly 3 or 4 times on floured surface and divide in
  half. Shape into 2 round loaves, each about 5-inch in diameter. With
  sharp knife, score loaves with cross slash, cutting 1 inch deep.
  
  Place loaves on ungreased baking sheet and bake at 425 degrees 15
  minutes, then reduce heat and continue to bake 25 to 30 minutes
  longer or until loaves are brown on top and sound hollow when tapped
  on bottom. Cool at least 5 minutes on cooling rack.  Loaves can be
  baked several hours ahead and reheated in low oven.  Cut into thick
  or thin wedges. Serve warm or at room tempature.

      8 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      4 ts Salt
      2 ts Allspice
    2/3 c  Instant nonfat milk
           Zest from 1 lemon

MMMMM-------------------------FOR 1 LOAF------------------------------
      4 c  Mix
      2 pk Dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Soft butter

  To make mix, combine all ingredients in plastic bag except lemon
  zest. Add zest and shake bag well. Seal and set aside until needed.
  To make 1 loaf: sprinkle yeast over warm water and let foam for 5
  minutes. Place 2 cups of well sahken mix into a large bowl with the
  milk, butter and yeat mixture and beat with an electric mixer until
  well blended. Cover bowl and let mixture rise in a warm place for 30

      Title: IRISH'S CRAB BUTTER
 Categories: Dips, Party
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 c  Cream cheese
    1/4 c  Mayonnaise
      6 oz Crab meat
      1 lg Onion, chopped fine
           Cocktail sauce
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Garlic, crushed (or a
           -pinch of instant garlic)
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
 
  Allow butter and cream cheese to soften before starting. Mix mayo,
  butter and cream cheese. Do not use a blender, as the mixture will
  get soupy. Add lemon juice, garlic, worcestershire sauce, pepper,
  etc. to taste.
  
  Mix in crab (or whatever) and onion.  Of the choices, I feel crab is
  the best. Chill at least two hours, cover with cocktail sauce. This
  is an important part of the recipe.
  
  I recommend Wakefield crab meat, Shrimp or Shrimp & Crab. I usually
  use Crosse & Blackwell's cocktail sauce, but feel free to use any
  kind that you trust. You can make your own simple cocktail sauce by
  mixing 3 parts catsup to 1 part horseradish and adding tabasco,
  garlic, worcestershire sauce to taste.
  
  Serve over Triscuits (they're nice and strong, to survive heavy
  scooping) or veggies. Irish is the friend from whom I got this recipe.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Incredible crab or shrimp dip -- My first encounter with this dip
  came at a New Year's party a few years ago. I was standing by the
  munchies table trying not to embarrass myself too much, when a woman
  came up to me and pointed out this dip. She explained to me that at a
  previous party she had lost control eating it and got a spoon!
  
  It's incredibly rich, and requires a lot of will power not to eat too
  much. Yield:  Serves 6 gluttons.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: IRON HORSE CUCUMBER SALAD
 Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Salads, Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lg Cucumbers
           -- peeled, seeded and diced
      1 lg Onion
           -- peeled, sliced paper thin
      1 lg Bunch radishes; trimmed
           -- sliced in thin rounds
      1    Green bell pepper; cored
           -- seeded, in thin strips
      1 sm Fresh cilantro bunch*
    3/4 c  Rice wine vinegar
      1 tb Fresh ginger; minced
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  *Cilantro should be rinsed, dried and with stems removed, to equal
  about 1 and 1/2 cups loosely packed leaves.
  
  Put cucumbers, onion, radishes and bell pepper in a large bowl; toss
  well. If they are not prechilled, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
  
  Mince cilantro leaves.
  
  Drizzle rice wine vinegar over vegetables, sprinkle the cilantro and
  ginger over them, and toss thoroughly to combine. Season to taste and
  serve immediately.
  
  Loomis writes: "The key to this salad...is to use the freshest,
  crispest vegetables you can find.  It should be served chilled to get
  the best effect, but you can avoid a time lag between preparation and
  serving by refrigerating the vegetables for several hours before
  beginning, so they go chilled right into the bowl.
  
  "The amount of onion you use depends on whether or not you're a real
  onion fan.  I love a sweet onion in this salad, but if you're
  onion-shy, use half the amount called for. The recipe did not
  originally call for salt and pepper, and it does not need it, but you
  should adjust the seasoning to your taste."

  The Iroquois were blessed with clear, cool lakes and sparkling
  streams, and both served up an abundance of fish. Fish soup, or
  u'nega'gei, as the Iroquois called it, was a favorite. One early
  recipe is described, "Fish of any kind is boiled in a pot with a
  quantity of water. It is then removed and coarse corn siftings
  stirred in to make a soup of suitable consistency."  When wild onions
  and greens were available, they were usually tossed into the soup
  pot, adding both color and flavor.

  In the name of sportsmanship, let's consider one more way to look at
  fruits and vegetables.  "According to L.H. Bailey, a vegetable is in
  horticultural usage, an edible herbaceous plant or part thereof that
  is commonly used for culinary purposes.  In common usage, the fruits
  of the tomato, cucumber, squash, etc., are considered as vegetables,
  grown with other vegetables in the home garden, although of course
  each one is a seed bearing organ and hence, under strict usage of the
  language, might be considered a fruit." It is also as popularaly
  understodd, any plant cultivated for its edible parts.  This loose
  definition includes roots (beet and carrot), tubers (potato), stems
  (celery), leaves (lettuce), flower buds and heads (cauliflower),
  fruits (tomato), and seeds (peas, beans, corn).
  
  Looking back to the list, we can easily slip into familiar habits:
  artichoke, asparagus, avocado, bean, beet, broccoli, brussels sprouts,
  cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, corn, cucumber, eggplant,
  lettuce, onion, parsnip, pea, pepper, potato, radish, squash, and
  tomato are vegetables, all the others are fruits.
  
  In other words, if you call it a vegetable, and your neighbour calls
  it a vegetable, and your local grocer calls it a vegetable, then it
  must be a vegetable. You like the sound of this? Fine with us. And,
  deep in our hearts, we suspect that's the best way to play, according
  to Hoyle.

 Categories: Spice mix
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 ts Black mustard seeds
      2 ts Cumin seeds
      2 ts Black peppercorns
      2 ts Anise seed
      2 ts Fenugreek seeds
      3 tb Coriander seeds
      4 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  To make your own curry powder, you will need a small spice grinder,
  clean coffee grinder or mortar and pestle. heat a medium frying pan
  over medium-low heat and add the mustard seeds, cumin, peppercorns,
  anise, fenugreek and coriander. Shaking the pan, dry roast the spices
  until the mustard seeds turn gray and the spices become fragrant,
  about 5 minutes. Let cool, then grind to a fine powder. Transfer to a
  small bowl and stir in the turmeric and cinnamon. Store tightly
  sealed in a dark place. It will keep for up to 6 months (or longer)
  and can be used like any other curry powder.
  
  Note: This is what's known as a sweet curry powder. It is especially
  versatile because it has very little heat of its own. Use it as is or
  spice it up by adding cayenne or other hot pepper to taste.

      6 lg Egg Yolks
      1 pn Salt
      2 c  Heavy Cream
     15 oz Can Cream Of Coconut; (fx.

      2 tb Dark Rum; -or-
      2 ts Vanilla Extract
           -----Pineapple-Ginger
           -Syrup-----
      1 md Pineapple; peeled and cubed
      2    In Piece Ginger Peel; slice
           -thinly
    1/2 c  Granulated Sugar
           -----Assembly-----
      1 c  Heavy Cream
      1 tb Granulated Sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
     32 oz Bottle Seltzer Water;
           -chilled
           -----For Garnish-----
      2 tb Macadamia Nuts; chopped
      4    Pineapple Wedges
 
  Make the coconut ice cream:
  
  1. In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer set at
  medium-high speed, using the wire whisk attachment, beat the egg
  yolks and salt for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are pale yellow and
  form a thick ribbon when the whisk is lifted.
  
  2. In a heavy, medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream to a
  gentle boil. Remove the pan from the heat and gradually stir 1 cup of
  the hot cream into the beaten egg yolks until well blended. Gradually
  stir this mixture back into the saucepan. Cook the custard over
  medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 2 to 4
  minutes, or until the custard has thickened slightly. It is done when
  you can run your finger down the back of the custard-coated spoon and
  a path remains in the custard for several seconds. Do not allow the
  custard to come to a boil.
  
  3. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately strain through a
  sieve into a stainless steel bowl. Place the bowl over a larger bowl
  of ice water and stir the custard for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cool.
  Whisk in the cream of coconut and rum or vanilla. Remove the bowl of
  custard from the bowl of ice water. Cover the surface of the custard
  with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight,
  until very cold.
  
  4. Scrape the chilled custard into the container of an ice cream
  maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.
  Transfer the ice cream to a medium bowl. Cover the surface of the ice
  cream with plastic wrap and cover the bowl tightly with aluminum
  foil. Freeze the ice cream overnight.
  
  Make the pineapple-ginger syrup:
  
  1. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping
  blade, combine the pineapple and ginger pieces. Process for 45
  seconds, or until the mixture is pureed. Transfer the puree to a
  medium, non-corrosive saucepan. Add the sugar to the puree and cook
  over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the
  mixture comes to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer the puree for 10
  minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and cool the puree completely.
  Strain the puree through a fine-meshed sieve into a medium bowl.
  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2
  hours, until chilled.
  
  Assemble the ice cream sodas:
  
  1. In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy duty electric mixer,
  using the wire whip attachment, beat the cream, sugar, and vanilla at
  medium-high speed until stiff peaks start to form. Fill a pastry bag
  fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #6) with the cream. Refrigerate
  the cream until ready to use.
  
  2. Pour 1/2 cup of the pineapple syrup into a tall, 16-ounce glass.
  Add seltzer water almost to the top of the glass. Place a scoop of
  the coconut ice cream on the side of the glass. Pipe a large rosette
  of whipped cream next to the scoop. Top with 1/2 tablespoon of the
  macadamia nuts and garnish with a pineapple wedge. Repeat this
  procedure to make 3 more ice cream sodas. Serve immediately.
  
        4    servings.
  
  PREPARATION: 45 minutes plus chilling and freezing times.

      Title: ISRAELI CHOCOLATE-COATED ORANGE PEELS
 Categories: Candies, Fruits, Harned 1994, Jewish
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      3    Oranges
      2 c  Sugar
           -- plus extra for rolling
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      5 oz Bittersweet chocolate
           -- finely chopped
           -- not unsweetened
      2 ts Vegetable oil
 
  "I first tasted these peels in Israel, where they are made from the
  local Jaffa oranges.  Often when you drop in at someone's home, the
  hostess will set them out for nibbles."
  
  Line a baking sheet with wax paper. Set aside.
  
  Scrub oranges well, and cut in half.  Scoop out the flesh and reserve
  for another use.  Place the shells in a medium-sized bowl and cover
  with cold water, keeping them under water with a small plate or lid.
  Let soak for about 4 hours or overnight, replacing the water once.
  
  Cut each shell in half; place in a large heavy saucepan. Add water to
  cover and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Boil for 15 minutes.
  Drain and repeat the process.  When oranges are cool enough to
  handle, cut into strips about 1/4 by 2".  Return the strips to the
  saucepan; add sugar and 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer over low heat.
  Cook gently, stirring occasionally, until liquid is almost gone,
  about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (Watch closely toward the end of cooking.)
  Add the lemon juice; stir to coat the strips. Drain the strips in a
  sieve. When they are cool enough to handle, spread on the prepared
  baking sheet.
  
  Put all but 1/4 c. of the chocolate and the oil in the top of a double
  boiler set over barely simmering water. Stir just until melted, remove
  double boiler from heat, and add the remaining chocolate, stirring
  until melted.  Roll each orange strip in sugar, then dip half of each
  peel into the chocolate and return to the baking sheet. Place in the
  freezer for a minute or two to let the chocolate set. Remove from the
  freezer and let them sit for several hours until they are firm.
  (Store in an airtight container for up to 3 months.)

  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Cold butter or margerine,
           Cut into pieces
      1    Egg
      1    Egg white
      2 tb Milk

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lg Red sweet pepper, roasted
      1 pk 10-ounces frozen chopped,
           Spinach thawed
      1 lg Fennel bulb, trimmed and
           Coarsely chopped (1 cup)
      2 md Leeks, thinly sliced, 2/3 C.
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Ricotta cheese
      1 c  Shredded mozzarella (4-oz.)
    1/4 c  Pesto or Homemade pesto
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1    Egg yolk
      4 oz Salami, coarsely chopped
           (3/4 cup)
      1    Beaten egg yolk
 
  TO MAKE DOUGH in the food processor, place the steel blade in the
  processor bowl.  Add flour, cold butter, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
  Process with serveral on/off turns till mixture resembles coarse
  cornmeal. combine egg, egg white, and milk; add to processor and
  process till mixture forms a ball. (Or, for the mixing bowl method,
  combine flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium mixing bowl; cut in
  butter till mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add egg mixture; mix
  with a spoon or your hands till mixture forms a ball.) Cover dough;
  chill while preparing filling.
  
  FOR FILLING, cut roasted sweet pepper into strips; set aside. Drain
  spinach squeezing to remove excess liquid. In a 10-inch skillet cook
  fennel and leeks in hot oil for 5 to 7 minutes or till tender. In a
  mixing bowl stir together drained spinach, ricotta, mozarella, pesto,
  Parmesan, the first egg yolk and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.
  
  ON A LIGHTLY FLOURED SURFACE roll 2/3's of the chilled dough into a
  12-inch diameter circle.  Place the dough in an 8-inch sprinform pan
  (the dough will go about 2-1/2 inches up the sides). Press pleats in
  dough as necessary to fit.  Spread the bottom crust with half of the
  fennel mixture. Top with half of the spinach mixture, half of the
  salami, and half of the red pepper strips. Repeat layers.
  
  ROLL REMAINING DOUGH into an 8-inch circle; place atop filling. (You
  may want to save a few dough scraps for decorating the top of the
  pie.) Fold excess bottom crust over top crust; crimp edge to seal. If
  desired, cut reserved dough scraps into shapes and use to decorate
  the top of the pie. Or, cut a design, such as a leaf or a flower, out
  of the top. (If you don't cut a design out of top crust make a few
  slits in the top crust to let steam escape while baking.)  Brush with
  remaining egg yolk. Bake in a 375-degree oven about 50 minutes or
  till golden. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove sides of pan to
  serve.  Serves 10 to 12.
  
  TO BAKE AND CHILL AHEAD: Bake pie as directed; cool. Chill pie in pan
  about 1 hour.  Remove from pan, wrap in foil, and chill for up to 2
  days. Before serving, heat wrapped in foil, in a 350-degree oven for
  50 to 55 minutes or till heated through.
  
  TO BAKE AND FREEZE AHEAD: Bake pie as directed; cool. Chill pie in pan
  about 1 hour.  Remove from pan, wrap in foil, and freeze for up to 1
  month. To serve, thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Heat, wrapped in
  foil in a 350-degree oven for 50 to 55 minutes.

      2 c  Water
  5 1/4 oz Barley; 3/4 cup
 
  A tasty side dish for almost any entree, this filling grain also
  reheats nicely in the microwave. In a medium saucepan over medium
  heat cook onions, green pepper, and garlic until lightly browned. Add
  small amounts of water if necessary to prevent drying. Add tomatoes
  spices and water. Bring to a boil. Stir in barley, reduce heat to
  low, cover and simmer 50 minutes until barley is tender and water is
  absorbed. Stir occasionally while cooking and add more water if
  necessary. Note: the original recipe called to saute the 1st three
  ingredients in olive oil(1T+1t) but I chose to eliminate it and
  eliminate almost 5 gms fat per serving.

 Categories: Casserole, Lamb, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5 tb Olive oil
      1 kg Lamb, lean boneless from the
           - shoulder cut into 4cm pcs
      2    Brown onions
    1/2 bn Italian parsley, leaves only
           -chopped
      3    Garlic cloves crushed
      1    Capsicum red, cut into strip
    250 ml Lamb or beef stock
    500 g  Potatoes, peeled & cut into
           - 4cm pieces
     60 g  Pecorino, grated
 
  The potatoes should be yellow, waxy ones, such as Petrones or
  Desirees.
  
  Heat half the oil in a large heavy pot.  Brown lamb well in batches
  and, using a slotted spoon, remove to a plate. Add remaining oil. Add
  onion and cook until softened. Add parsley, garlic and capsicum.
   Return lamb to pot, stir and add stock and freshly ground pepper to
  taste. (Don't add salt yet as pecorino is a salty cheese) Reduce
  heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
  
  Add potato and simmer for another 20 minutes, or until lamb is almost
  tender.   Stir in cheese and cook for 10 minutes. Season with freshly
  ground pepper and salt to taste.
  
  Best if cooked 1 - 2 days ahead and refrigerated.
   Like all casseroles, it will improve in flavour during the resting
  period. Great for entertaining, because it can be cooked well in
  advance, leaving you free to get on with the many chores involved in
  throwing a party.

      2 c  Bread flour
  1 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
 
  Recipe by: rec.food.cooking You didn't mention the size of your
  breadmaker, so I'm going to figure it's the 1lb loaf (I have a
  panasonic). Anyway, I've used this recipe at least a dozen times and
  I've never had a failure. I USE ONLY PILSBURY BREAD FLOUR . . . and
  it has nothing to do with the fact my father and brother work for the
  company. Here goes:
  
  Ialways put water in first and then add the dry ingredients with the
  yeast on top.  I use the NORMAL setting (3.5 hours) on mine.

      Title: ITALIAN BREAD SALAD (PANZANELLA)
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  1 hard baugette
        x  Ripe, juicy tomatoes
        x  Minced onions or scallions
           (red onions look nice)
        x  Capers
        x  Minced bell peppers
        x  Minced fresh garlic
        x  Minced fresh basil and
           Parsley
        x  Salt, red wine vinegar and
           Freshly cracked pepper
 
  If using a very hard baugette, run it under some water and then
  crumble it into a bowl.  Alternatively you can cube the bread or
  lightly toast it if it's fresh and then cut into cubes. Add the
  remaining ingredients to taste.
  
  The bread should make up about 3/4 of the salad.  The consistency is
  comparable to potato or rice salad. Everything is moist and clinging
  together but it isn't soupy nor is it dry.
  
  Ripe, juicy homegrown tomatoes (this provides most of the moisture in
  the dish, some of which used to come from olive oil)
  
  I think this tastes best at room temperature.
