      Title: BAVARIAN HERB SOUP (KRAUTLSUPPE)
 Categories: Soups/stews, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Herbs *
      4 tb Butter
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      1 qt Water or vegetable stock
      1 lg Potato, peeled and chopped
           -into small cubes
 
  Serves 4.
  
  salt and pepper bread cubes for croutons
  
  * at least 3 of these:  chervil, watercress, spinach, sorrel
  (dandelion and pimpernel for brave souls) Bitter herbs are
  traditionally eaten at Easter in Christian countries as a sign of
  penitence. This Bavarian soup is served on Easter Thursday, known as
  Maundy Thursday. Fresh chervil, easily available in any German
  market, is usually the dominating flavor. This is a delicate
  fresh-tasting soup for any time of the year.
  
  You will need a large saucepan.  Pick over and wash the herbs,
  stripping the leaves from those stalks which are too woody. Chop the
  rest.
  
  Melt the butter in a deep pan and fry the onion gently until
  transparent. Add the herbs and sweat them for a moment before you
  pour in the water or broth.  Add the potato to the soup. Bring the
  soup to a boil, and then turn down the heat.  Simmer for 20 minutes.
  Mash the potato in the soup to thicken it a little.  Taste, and add
  salt and freshly milled pepper.
  
  Serve with bread croutons fried in butter or bacon fat (goose fat is
  even better).  They should be so hot that they sizzle when they are
  added to the hot soup at the table.

     50 g  Beef suet
      1    Small Onion;coarsely
           Chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 dl Milk; lukewarm
    250 g  Liver
      2    Eggs;lightly beaten
      1 ts Dried marjoram
    600 ml Beef stock, well flavoured
 
  Put the sliced rolls in a large bowl. Sprinkle them with salt and
  pour over the lukewarm milk. Leave them to soak until required. Trim
  the liver and put it through a meat mincer together with the suet and
  onion. Add the soaked bread, the eggs and marjoram, and mix with a
  wooden spoon until well blended. The mixture will be very soft. Bring
  the stock to the boil in a large saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and
  simmer the stock. Divide the dumpling mixture into 8 portions. With
  wet hands, shape a portion at a time into a ball and drop it into the
  stock. Simmer gently for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the dumplings are
  cooked through. Serve 2 dumplings per person in soup plates, together
  with some of the stock.
  
  Bavarian liver dumplings are almost as large as tennis balls. two of
  them make an ample portion, served either in a well-flavoured stock,
  or as a main course, garnished with fried onion rings and accompanied
  by mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.

 Categories: Thai, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
     12 lg Jerusalem Artichokes
           Olive oil
     12    Cloves shallots
     20    Scallops
      4    Kaffir Lime Leaves
      8    Wing Beans
    600 ml Fish Stock
      3    Limes, Juice Only
      2 tb Fish Sauce
           Pepper to taste
 
  True shallots (echalotes) are gradually becoming more widely
  available. They look rather like a large, loose head of garlic with
  glossy red-brown skin.
  
  Clean and peel 12 large Jerusalem artichokes. Put a little olive oil
  in a roasting pan, add the artichokes and roast in a medium oven
  until golden, a little caramelized and cooked through - about 20
  minutes. Peel and slice 12 cloves of true shallots. Brush 28 scallops
  lightly with oil on both sides. Have ready 4 kaffir lime leaves (or
  substitute zest from the limes). Wash 8 wing beans (or substitute 4
  very small bok choys about 10 cms tall - halve them lengthwise) and
  blanch in boiling water.
  
  Put the blanched vegetables in 4 large bowls (pasta bowls or similar),
  together with the whole roasted artichokes, and scatter the sliced
  shallots over the top. Meanwhile, in a saucepan com- bine 600 mL fish
  stock, the juice of 3 limes, Thai fish sauce to taste (about 2
  tablespoons) and pepper to taste and bring to the boil.
  
  Heat an iron grill or heavy frying pan to a very high heat. Do not
  grease. Throw in the oiled scallops and sear them very quickly on
  both sides, so that they take colour on the outside but are barely
  warm inside. Divide the scallops between the soup bowls, top with the
  lime leaves and pour in the broth. Serve.

      1 pn Sugar
    1/4 c  Buckshot (pellet shaped
           -pasta)
 
  Salt & pepper to taste
  
  Place water in stock pot.  Add split peas, pearl barley and lima
  beans. Cook until peas are mush.  Add carrots, onion, celery tops,
  chicken soup base, butter or margarine, dill weed, sugar, pasta, salt
  and pepper. Cook slowly until vegetables are done.  Stir frequently
  to prevent scorching on bottom.  May be frozen. More water may be
  added to soup if too thick. Cook for 3 to 4 hours.
  
  Makes 8 to 10 servings.
  
  NOTE:  This recipe was developed by a woman who sells the soup at
  Hadassah Bazaars.  She says the secret to the soup is long slow
  cooking and the addition of the dill weed. It's a very tasty one!

      4 lb Boston pork butt
      1    Bottle BBQ Saucee
 
  Cook Boston pork butt all day, or until it is so tender it falls apart
  easily.  Romove from pot and let it cool slightly, but do not let it
  get cold.  Pull meat away from fat (remove fat and discard) and shred
  meat with two forks.  Return meat to crockpot and add a bottle of
  your favorite barbeque sauce (I like KC Masterpiece, or Kraft Honey
  Barbeque sauce) and stir until thoroughly combined. Continue cooking
  until heated through. This makes great sandwiches on buns, or meat
  entree. Great with coleslaw and baked beans.

  MEDIUM coals.  Grill for 20 minutes. Turn; grill 15 to 25 minutes
  more or till tender and no longer pink. Brush with sauce frequently
  during the last 10 minutes of grilling.
  
  Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Heat any remaining sauce
  either on the grill or stove top; pass with chicken.

  ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.

  flavor improves. NOTE:  Ms. Brody says that this dish could easily
  feed a crowd if you have a pot or pots big enough to double or
  guadruple, etc. it.
  
  1.  In a large heavy pot combine all the soup ingredients except the
  raisins.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat while preparing the
  meatballs.
  
  2.  Combine meatball ingredients, stirring them to mix thoroughly.
  With wet hands, roll the meat mixture in 1 1/4" balls. Add the
  meatballs to the boiling cabbage soup, reduce the heat to medium-low,
  cover and simmer for 2 hours.
  
  3.  Remove the cover, add the raisins, and cook for another 30
  minutes in the uncovered pot.
  
  She suggests that mashed potatoes would be an excellent accompaniment.
  Also, that the dish goes well with broad egg noodles.

    Mash beans. Add all ingredients and mix well. (If you use all of the

  1/4 to 1/2 cup of soy, nut, or rice milk. Of coarse you also could
  use whole milk. Be sure you don't thin it too much or it will be
  mushy. Look for a 'hamburger' consistency.)
    Spoon about 2 heaping Tablespoons of mix onto grill or frypan for
  each burger and flatten with greased pancake turner. Turn several
  times rather than just once on each side like conventional burgers,
  they have a better texture that way.

           Lettuce, chopped
      1 bn Scallions; chopped
      1    Tomato; chopped
 
  Saute the frozen onions and green peppers in a few tablespoons of
  water in a skillet.  Drain and rinse the beans and place in a skillet
  and mash with a potato masher. Add the cooked rice, corn, spices and
  water. Heat 5 to 10 minutes until most of water is absorbed, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Heat the tortillas quickly (just to soften) in a preheated skillet, a
  toaster oven, or a microwave. Place a line of bean mixture down the
  middle of each tortilla, add a teaspoon of salsa and any of the other
  toppings as desired.  Fold up 1/2 inch on each side, tuck in the top
  edge and roll into a burrito.  Serve immediately, topped with
  additional salsa if desired.
  
  The leftover bean mixture can be kept in the refrigerator and
  reheated in the microwave prior to assembly.
  
  The bean mixture can be adapted by changing the kind of beans (try
  kidney beans) or omitting the corn, or adding your favorite
  ingredient. I got more servings out of the recipe than the book got
  out of the original recipe, so I guess I put less mixture on each
  tortilla.

     10 lg (10") tortillas or chapatis
      1 c  Dried pinto beans, soaked
           Overnight in 3 cups water
      1    Bay leaf
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 c  TVP granules or flakes
    1/2 c  (less 1 T.) hot water
      2 ts Chili powder
      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Oregano
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Onion, chopped
 
   Drain, rinse and cook the beans until tender (70-90 minutes) in 3
  cups of water with the bay leaf and garlic.
  
   Drain the beans, but reserve the liquid in case it is needed later
  to thin the filling mixture.
  
   Combine the TVP, hot water, hot bean liquid, chili powder, cumin,
  salt and oregano.
  
   Saute the onion in the olive oil in a good sized skilled until
  softened.
  
   Add the seasoned TVP and cook a few minutes more. Stir in the cooked
  beans, then transfer mixture to a food processor or blender and mash
  to a fairly smooth textured filling, adding a little of the bean
  liquid if mixture is too thick. Taste and add a little hot sauce if
  desired. If done in a blender, you may need to do it in two batches,
  then mix the batches together.
  
   To assemble: heat a griddle or skillet until a few drops of water
  dance on the surface. Dry fry each tortilla on both sides until the
  surface of the tortilla begins to bubble and brown slightly. Keep
  them warm in a thick towel. When all are heated, place about 1/3 cup
  of filling down one side of a tortilla and roll up. You may wish to
  enclose or serve with side dishes of shredded lettuce, grated soy
  cheese, salsa sauce or sliced avocados.
  
   Burritos may be made ahead, kept wrapped, and baked before serving.
  Unwrap, place on cookie sheet, bursh tops lightly with oil if desired
  and bake at 350 degrees about 20 minutes.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Waldine Van Geffen VGHC42A
        x  Beans
 
  How many beans to serve how many? As a rough rule, a pound of dried
  legumes will yield 8 moderate servings. Getting them ready: Spread
  beans on a big pan or plate and pick out any rubbish-especially small
  pebbles-and broken beans. Rinse in a colander. To soak or not?
  Lentils don't need to be soaked and neither do split peas. All other
  dried legumes need soaking, especially if they have spent some time
  on the shelf. Soaking how-tos: The basic way: Cover with water to
  twice the depth of the beans and leave for 4 hours (most kinds) or up
  to 24 hours, with changes of water, for fava beans or other
  tough-skinned types. Drain, then cook in fresh water. Quick-soaking
  or parboiling: Cover with plenty of water, bring to boiil and boil
  for 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside, covered for 1 hour. Drain and cook in
  fresh water. Cooking: This varies widely among beans. The newest crop
  may cook in as little as half the time needed by long-stored beans.
  The rule is to cook beans at a gentle simmer, partly covered, until a
  sample is tender to the tooth. Depending on bean kind and age, this
  may take as little as 45 minutes or as long as 3 hours; fava beans
  may need even longer. When to salt: Wait until the beans are tender.
  Salting before that point will toughen them permanently.  (wrv)

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Butter or soft margarine
      1 c  Cooked kidney beans wt / red
    2/3 c  2% milk
 
  Revised after testing Feb 94.  Used 1 1/2 cup flour NOT 2 1/2 cups as
  printed in the book.  The 1 cup beans probably replaced 1 cup flour
  in the original recipe.
  
  Stir dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.  Cut in butter until
  mixture resembles crumbs.
  
  In food processor or blender, puree beans with milk. OR mash beans
  and stir in milk.  Stir into dry ingredients all at once to make
  light soft dough.
  
  Turn out onto lightly floured board, sprinkle with flour and knead
  about 20 seconds.
  
  Shape biscuits by rolling, patting and cutting or divide dough into 16
  pieces and shape by hand.
  
  Bake at 400 F for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.

      Title: BEAN BURGER (OVO)
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Dry kidney beans
      1 ts Curry
      4 tb Cornstarch
      4 tb Cornmeal
      1    Onion, minced
           Garlic to taste, I used four
           Cloves, minced
      1 tb Black pepper
      2    Carrots, grated (acts as
           Binder)

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONS-------------------------------
      2 tb Beef bullion and or
           1*tablespoon soy sauce
      2    Eggs (to act as a binder)
 
  make up the beans, (slow overnight or faster boil & wait) then mash.
  Add the spices, I added the vege beef bullion as I don't worry too
  much about the salt. Form into patties ( make sure they are thin) and
  fry in a non-stick pan. I found that mine took quite a while to cook
  (too thick) but they turned out very good! Passed the taste test, my
  8 year old just loved them.

      Title: BEAN BURGERS (EATING IN)
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 c  Cooked beans (kidney or
           -pinto beans are good)
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      1 lg Potato, cooked
      2 lg Tomatoes, chopped
      2 ts Chopped thyme
           -(or 1 scant teaspoon dry)
    3/4 c  Breadcrumbs or whole-wheat
           -flour
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
 
  From "Eating In," The Biosphere Press, Space Biosphere Ventures.
  
  Mix all the ingredients thoroughly, either in a food processor or
  with a potato masher. The cooked beans should be mashed, not pureed,
  and the mixture should form into balls easily. If the mixture is too
  wet, add a little more breadcrumbs or flour. Form the mixture into
  eight burgers and place them on a lightly greased baking tray. Bake
  at 350'F. for 45 minutes, turning them over after 30 minutes. Place
  the burgers inside buns ("Eating In" also includes a recipe for
  whole-wheat buns) and top with fried onions, lettuce, tomato,
  pickles, or whatever your taste dictates. Each burger contains: 352
  calories, 0 cholesterol, 1 gram fat, 20 grams protein.

      Title: BEAN BURGERS BY ANITA CECENA.
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Minced green onions.
  1 1/2 tb Minced garlic.
      2 tb White wine/stock
     29 oz Cooked drained pinto beans
    3/4 c  Cracker meal or bread crumbs
      2    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Seasoned rice vinegar
    1/2 ts Italian seasonings (oregano,
           -basil, etc.)
 
  Preheat oven 350 degrees. Saute onions/garlic in stock/white wine.
  Combine with beans, cracker meal, egg whites, parsley, vinegar,
  seasonings. Mash well with fork until blended, but not entirely
  smooth. (Here I depart from recipe...I make up a bunch of hamburger
  sized patties, freeze some, refridge some, and cook them as needed
  for about 20 minutes in a toaster oven...I know they are done when
  the egg/bread crumbs are brown and the patty is a bit dry.  I find
  this basic recipe can absorb many, many changes.I've used white
  beans, black beans, whatever, sauteed mushrooms, hot sauce, catsup,
  etc. The main thing is to get a good texture/cohesiveness in the
  final product, so it sticks together. Have fun!)

      Title: BEAN BURRITO CASSEROLE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12    Tortillas; * see note
      3 c  Pinto beans, canned; rinsed
      2 c  Brown rice, cooked
      1 c  Green onions; chopped
           Enchilada sauce:
      2 c  Tomato sauce; ** see note
      3 c  Water
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Onion powder
      3 tb Chili powder
      4 tb Cornstarch; *** see note
 
  Preparation Time: 2:07 This may be made without the brown rice; use 5
  cups mashed cooked and drained beans instead. The sauce can also be
  used in other Mexican recipes.
  
  To make the enchilada sauce combine all ingredients in a saucepan and
  cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens,
  about 7 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the
  enchilada sauce in the bottom of a covered casserole dish. Take one
  tortilla at a time and spread some beans, rice, and scallons down the
  center. Roll up and place seam-side-down in the casserole dish.
  Repeat until all ingredients are used. Pour the remaining enchilada
  sauce over the rolled-up tortillas, cover, and bake for 30 minutes.

      Title: BEAN BURRITO LAYERS
 Categories: Beans, Vegetarian, Mexican
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Green Lentils; dried
    1/4 c  Pinto Beans; dried
    1/4 c  Red Kidney Beans; dried
    1/4 c  Baby Lima Beans; dried
      1    Onion; medium
      4    Garlic Cloves
      2    Jalapeno Peppers *
      1 tb Oregano; dried
      1 tb Chili Powder
    1/4 c  Coriander Leaves; chopped
      6 oz Monterey Jack Cheese; grated
      6    Flour Tortillas; 10"
      1    Tomato; medium, chopped
      1    Lettuce; shredded
      1    Salsa
 
  Servings:  4
  
  Rinse lentils and beans, discarding any that look suspicious, and
  soak in clean water 4 - 6 hours, or overnight. Put into medium
  saucepan, bring to boil and simmer, covered, 30 minutes. Add water if
  necessary.
  
  Peel and chop onion.  Microwave on "High" 2 - 2 1/2 minutes until
  soft. [If you prefer, you may saute the onion in about 2 T. oil. I
  omit the oil to keep the fat content down. The flavour does not seem
  to suffer.] Chop the Jalapena pepper.  (*) Adjust the quantity to
  your own taste and / or tolerance.
  
  Peel and crush the garlic.
  
  Drain the lentil-bean mixture.  Reserve 1/2 cup of liquor. In a food
  processor puree the lentil-bean mixture, the onion, the garlic, the
  jalapena peppers, the oregano, the chile powder, and the coriander
  leaves, adding some of the reserved liquor as necessary to process.
  [The final puree should be quite thick.]
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 325 F.
  
  Assemble as follows on an oven-proof plate, pizza-pan or cookie-sheet:
  
  Place a flour tortilla on the *lightly* greased surface. Cover with
  lentil-bean puree [4 - 5 T.]. Sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Add
  another flour tortilla and repeat, saving enough cheese to cover the
  top of the final flour tortilla.  Bake for 20 - 30 minutes.
  
  Remove from oven and allow to "firm-up" for 5 - 10 minutes before
  serving.
  
  Garnish with salsa, chopped tomato and shredded lettuce. Serve with
  rice, Couscous and / or corn.
  
  The amount of oregano, coriander leaves, chile powder, or jalapena
  peppers may be varied to suit individual tastes. I use more peppers!
  If you're prone to "problems" with beans, add 1/4 - 1/2 t. Hing [Hing
  is a mixture of rice-flour, turmeric and asafoetida
  <ass-uh-fuh-TEE-duh> found in most East-Indian specialty stores. It
  can significantly reduce flatulence.

      Title: BEAN BURRITOS WITH TVP
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
      8 lg Flour Tortillas, 10"
      2 c  Black or pinto beans
      1 c  Vegetarian Chili Mix (TVP)
    7/8 c  Water, or white grape juice
      1    Medium onion, diced
           Garnish:
           Diced tomatoes, black olives
           Guacamole, diced onions,
           Picante Sauce
 
  Method: Heat water or juice to boiling and pour over TVP in a
  heatproof bowl. Allow to sit for 10 minutes until water is absorbed.
  Add beans with juice to TVP. Saute onions in a little water or juice
  until soft. Lay out your tortillas flat, and divide bean-TVP mixture
  evenly among the 8 tortillas. Then fold the tortilla up from the
  bottom, down from the top, and then fold the two ends to the middle.
  "Pin" them with a toothpick. Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray,
  place the "envelopes" on the cookie sheet, and spray them with the
  cooking spray. Place in a 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes until
  crisp and slightly browned. Take the toothpicks out when baked - they
  will stay in shape. Use what you need, and freeze the rest in plastic
  freezer bags. When ready to serve, heat in oven or microwave and top
  with tomatoes and onions - guacamole and black olives, picante sauce
  as desired.

      Title: BEAN LASAGNE
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 cn Ff vegetarian refried beans
      1    12 oz bottle mild taco
           Sauce
      2 cn Stewed tomatoes, one
           Drained, one not
      1 c  Ff cottage cheese
      1 c  Corn kernels, frozen is ok
     10    To 12 lasagne noodles,
           Uncooked
    1/4 c  Black olives, sliced
 
  In a bowl mix beans with about half the juice from one can of
  tomatoes and a couple of tablespoons of taco sauce. You want the
  beans to be almost but not quite pourable. Mix the rest of the taco
  sauce and tomato juice and set aside.
  
  Put about a quarter of the taco sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13"
  lasagne pan. Cover sauce with a layer of noodles. Layer, in any order
  you want, the beans, corn, cheese, drained tomatoes, sauce and
  noodles, being sure to end up with enough beans to cover the top with
  no noodles showing. The resulting mess should be pretty wet.
  
  Cover tightly with foil.  Bake at 350 for about an hour, until the
  noodles are tender. Check every 5-10 minutes after 45 minutes of
  cooking to see how the noodles are doing. Remove foil, sprinkle with
  olives. Bake another couple of minutes. Let sit for about 5 minutes
  before serving.
  
  Serves 3-4 as a main dish. Tastes even better the next day.
  
  Variation: If you want to pre-cook the noodles, don't use as much
  tomato juice and cook for only about 30 minutes.
  
  Variation: Other veggies would work well in here too. What do you
  have in the frig?
  
  Variation: You could top it with a little ff cheese-stuff in the last
  few minutes. And no doubt you could make it vegan by leaving off all
  milk products altogether.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Sesame seeds
      1 lb Fresh bean sprouts
           - thoroughly washed
           -    and drained
      3 md Garlic cloves
           - peeled and minced
      2 md Scallions; trimmed & minced
      1    1" cube ginger
           - peeled and minced
      2 tb Oriental sesame oil
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
      2 tb Cider vinegar
      1 tb Mirin (sweet rice wine)
      2 ts Light brown sugar
      1 ts Spicy sesame oil
 
  Makes 4 to 6 Servings
  
  Fresh bean sprouts are a must for this recipe from China's Hunan
  province. The canned variety don't have the requisite crispness. Keep
  a close eye on the toasting sesame seeds so they don't burn.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 300F. Toast the sesame seeds by spreading them over
  the bottom of a pie tin. Roast for 12-to-16 minutes, stirring often,
  until they are golden. The seeds can be toasted in advance and stored
  in an airtight container. Place the bean sprouts in a large heatproof
  bowl and set it aside. In a medium-size skillet set over moderately
  low heat, stir-fry the garlic, scallions and ginger in the oil for 2
  to 3 minutes, until they are limp. Add all the remaining ingredients,
  increase the heat to moderate, then boil the mixture, uncovered, for
  1 minute to slightly reduce the liquid. Pour the boiling dressing
  over the bean sprouts, toss well, then cover the bowl and chill the
  salad for several hours. Toss again before serving.

      4 lb Bulk pork sausage
      1 c  Instant minced onion
    1/3 c  Sweet pepper flakes
    108 oz Kidney beans -- (No. 10
           Can)*
    105 oz Tomatoes -- (No. 10 can)
      2 tb Salt
      2 tb Chili powder
    1/8 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 c  Flour -- unsifted
    1/2 c  Water
 
  * A No. 10 can is the equivalent of 7 (16-oz) cans of kidney beans or
  4 (28-oz) cans.
  
  Line four 8x8-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap. Allow
  enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six servings
  or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be served
  without freezing.
  
  Crumble sausage; brown with onion and pepper flakes. Drain off fat.
  Add beans, tomatoes, salt, chili powder, and garlic powder. Mix flour
  and water until smooth. Stir into sausage mixture. Simmer about 30
  minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Serve hot mixture over cooked rice.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Pour each part to be frozen into a baking pan. Pack food
  tightly to avoid air pockets.  Cool for 30 minutes at room
  temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food.
  Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies
  directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and
  seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing,
  and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about
  4 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing
  packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Remove freezer

      Title: BEANS & TVP BURRITOS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Tex-mex, Main dish. 
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     10 lg (10") tortillas or chapatis
      1 c  Dried pinto beans, soaked
           Overnight in 3 cups water
      1    Bay leaf
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 c  TVP granules or flakes
    1/2 c  (less 1 T.) hot water
      2 ts Chili powder
      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Oregano
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Onion, chopped
 
  Drain, rinse and cook the beans until tender (70-90 minutes) in 3
  cups of water with the bay leaf and garlic.
  
  Drain the beans, but reserve the liquid in case it is needed later to
  thin the filling mixture.
  
  Combine the TVP, hot water, hot bean liquid, chili powder, cumin,
  salt and oregano.
  
  Saute the onion in the olive oil in a good sized skilled until
  softened.
  
  Add the seasoned TVP and cook a few minutes more. Stir in the cooked
  beans, then transfer mixture to a food processor or blender and mash
  to a fairly smooth textured filling, adding a little of the bean
  liquid if mixture is too thick. Taste and add a little hot sauce if
  desired. If done in a blender, you may need to do it in two batches,
  then mix the batches together.
  
  To assemble: heat a griddle or skillet until a few drops of water
  dance on the surface. Dry fry each tortilla on both sides until the
  surface of the tortilla begins to bubble and brown slightly. Keep
  them warm in a thick towel. When all are heated, place about 1/3 cup
  of filling down one side of a tortilla and roll up. You may wish to
  enclose or serve with side dishes of shredded lettuce, grated soy
  cheese, salsa sauce or sliced avocados. Serve immediately.
  
  To reheat: Burritos may be made ahead, kept wrapped, and baked before
  serving.  Unwrap, place on cookie sheet, bursh tops lightly with oil
  if desired and bake at 350 degrees about 20 minutes.

 Categories: Mexican, Beans
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Beans - black, turtle, pink,
           -or pinto
           An earthenware bean pot (I
           -used my crock pot)
     10 c  Hot water
    1/4 c  White onion, roughly sliced
      2 tb Lard
      1 tb Salt, or to taste
      2 lg Sprigs epazote (only if
           -black beans are used) (An
           -herb)
 
  *Pinto or pink beans will need 12 to 14 cups water
  
  Rinse the beans and run them through your hands to make sure that
  there are no small stones or bits of earth among them.
  
  Put the beans into the pot and cover them with the hot water. Add the
  onion and lard and bring to a boil.
  
  As soon as the beans come to a boil, lower the flame and let them
  barely simmer, covered, for about 3 hours for black beans and 2-1/2
  hours for the other varieties, or until they are tender, but not
  soft. Do not stir during this time.
  
  Add the salt and epazote, if you are using it, and simmer for another
  30 minutes.  Set aside, preferably until the next day. There should
  be plenty of soupy liquid.

  hours? I forget).
  
  When beans are cooked, ladle off and reserve some of the liquid from
  the top.  Mash the beans well.  (I never do this as well as I'd like;
  I've tried a potato masher and an empty iced-tea jar.) Add reserved
  liquid as necessary for consistency.  (I never have to add any,
  myself.) Stir in the chopped chiles and the salsa; heat through.

      1 lg Fat Clove of Garlic
      2 tb Sunflower oil
      1 c  Water
           Salt and Pepper
 
  Take a handful of beans, lay them flat and cut of the ends. Do the
  same with the other end, then the rest of the beans. Wash them. Heat
  the oil in a large frying pan, preferably one in which you can lay
  all the beans in one layer, and put in the beans and finely chopped
  garlic. Turn for two or three minutes until well coated in garlic and
  oil. Pour in just enough water to cover and turn the heat up to
  maximum. The water will boil away as the beans cook - it will take no
  more than seven or eight minutes. Once the beans started to sizzle as
  the water boils away, sprinkle them generously with salt and black
  pepper. When the water has completely evaporated the beans are ready.

      Title: BEANS WITH BASIL & CHIVES
 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Fresh green beans
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      1 tb Chopped chives
    1/4 c  Diced green pepper
    1/4 c  Diced red pepper
    1/4 c  Diced yellow pepper
    1/2 c  Boiling water
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Fresh basil minced
    1/2 c  Grated Paremesan cheese
 
  For this dish, only use the freshest ingredients, and use only fresh
  herbs. If fresh herbs are not available, it simply will not be the
  same. For a nice aesthetic touch, reserve a teaspoon of each color of
  diced pepper and a few pinches of chopped chives. Also save a sprig
  or two of the fresh basil (the centerpiece that looks like a flower
  of leaves would do nicely). When the dish is placed in it's serving
  dish, sprinkle the peppers, and chives over the cheese and top with
  sprigs of basil.
  ******************************************************* *************
  You may use 3/4 cup diced green pepper instead of 1/4 cup of each
  green, red and yellow, or any combination thereof if the yellow
  and/or the red are not available, but they add a touch of color and
  distinction to the dish. Take fresh young beans and remove stem and
  any strings (the young ones shouldn't have much of a string to worry
  about). Break them in half (or so the segments are a couple of inches
  long). Heat oil and garlic in a large frying pan (make sure it is
  large enough to hold all the beans). When the oil becomes hot, add
  the peppers and cook slowly for 3 minutes. Add the beans, water,
  salt, basil and chives and turn everything over until the herbs and
  peppers are well distributed over the beans. Cover and simmer until
  the beans have turned a bright green and are al'dente (tender but
  still crisp; which should take about 5 minutes). Mix in 1/4 cup
  cheese and sprinkle 1/4 cup on top. If you've reserved some of the
  diced peppers, chives and whole basil leaves, garnish the top of the
  dish with these.

  instead of Polish sausage and cut it into bite-sized pieces before
  cooking. I also added some powdered beef stock to the water for
  cooking. Then I packed the soup into empty jars to take to work. It
  reheats great! Also worked well for a quick supper for the kids.
  Definitely a keeper. I might add some chopped browned onions next
  time, though.

      Title: BEAR STEAKS WITH GREEK SEASONINGS
 Categories: Greek, Lamb, Game, Steaks, Jw
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Bear steaks
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
      1 tb Garlic powder
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper
      1 ts Combination of oregano,
           -marjoram, rosemary and/
           -or mint
 
  Trim all visible fat from the bear as it turns rancid rapidly.
  
  Whisk the other ingredients together until emulsified. Use the
  emulsion to marinate the meat for 2-3 hours, refrigerated. Longer
  marinading before cooking does not improve the meat as the remaining
  bear fat will go rancid despite refrigeration. Grill, broil or saute
  the steaks until WELL DONE. Bear should always be thoroughly cooked
  as a trichinosis precaution. Serve immediately.
  
  Do not try making a gravy from the marinade as it will usually have
  picked up a gamy taste from the bear meat.

      Title: BEARD'S BEER BATTER
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Eggs, separated
      2 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 tb Salt
    3/4 c  Beer, room temperature
    3/4 c  Flour
 
  The ultimate batter for deep frying... DIRECTIONS:
  
  BEER!  Whether it's ale, lager, pilsener, or stout, is terrific for
  cooking. Beer makes a batter for deep frying and smooths a French
  onion soup.  And what could be more compatible for lunch on a rainy
  Vancouver weekend out on the boat fishing for Spring salmon than a
  cold beer with a hot pastrami sandwich smothered with brown beer
  mustard?
  
  This is the late James Beard's recipe for batter to French fry
  vegetables. Trim your veggies, wash, dry thoroughly, dust with flour,
  dip into the batter, and fry in oil at 360 F. until done. However,
  James "missed the boat" on this one - it's far better for deep frying
  halibut, cod, or any other seafood.  The batter puffs up because of
  the beer's yeast, fries quickly, and as a result, doesn't commit the
  cardinal sin of seafood preparation - overcooking.  I think few of
  our piscine friends benefit from deep frying as a cooking method, but
  that's another story.
  
  To prepare, place flour in a mixing bowl and add egg yolks, salt,
  oil, and beer.  Stir batter until thoroughly mixed. Cover bowl with
  plastic wrap and allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours
  or as long as 24 - the longer the better, to a point. Just before
  using batter, stir it well again.  In a separate bowl, beat egg
  whites until stiff but not dry; gently fold egg whites into batter.
  Does 2 lbs. of veggies or 6 fish fillets, depending upon their size.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

 Categories: Cajun, Breads
      Yield: 100 Servings
 
      6 c  All purpose flour (soft)
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Shortening
      1 c  Milk
 
  Mix the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl or in a food
  processor fitted with a metal blade.
   Add the shortening and cut in or process until the mixture is the
  consistency of coarse meal.  Pour in the milk and stir or process just
  until the dough holds together. If it is dry or crumbly, add more
  milk. If it is too wet, add more flour.  Knead briefly in the food
  processor, then turn out onto a floured board or beat 1,001 times
  with a rolling pin.
   when it's ready, the dough should "snap" when you hit it. Fold the
  dough in half.    Roll out the folded dough until it is 1/2 inch
  thick. Cut with a 1-1/4-inch biscuit cutter into small rounds. Prick
  each round with a fork, making two parallel sets of holes in the
  biscuit. keep rolling out the dough, folding before cutting, until
  all the scraps are gone and you have made about 100 biscuits.
     Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the biscuits on a lightly
  greased pan.  Bake for 30 minutes, until crisp, but not browned. They
  should open easily when split with a fork. They will keep for weeks
  tightly covered in a tin or in the freezer.
   Split in two before serving. From Nathalie Dupree's "New Southern

      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     20    Chicken wings
  7 1/2 oz Tomato sauce (half can)
      2 tb Orange marmalade
      1 tb Honey
      2 ts Ginger, minced
      2 ts Fermented chili sauce
           -(Summit brand)
      2 ts Pepper vinegar
      4    Garlic cloves, peeled
      1 ts Salt (scant)
      2 ts MSG
    1/2 c  Water (more as needed)
        ds Tabasco, to taste
           -(or other hot pepper
 
                                                    -sauc )
  
  Cut off spurs from chicken wing-tips and rinse chicken wings. Place in
  pressure cooker with water; bring to pressure and cook at high heat
  for up to five minutes. Remove from pressure cooker and place
  cooked-out fat in wide-mouthed, tapered jar for other uses.
  
  Blend all ingredients except chicken and Tabasco (or hot sauce) until
  fairly even consistency, with no large chunks of ginger or garlic.
  
  Place 3/4 of sauce in pan.  Roll wings in sauce; remove wings to
  broiler pan (with slotted top).  Bake at 325 degrees F. for 20
  minutes. Remove from oven and spoon about half of remaining sauce on
  top of each piece; broil for 5 minutes.  Add Tabasco or other hot
  pepper sauces to taste and serve.
  
  Beau's notes:
  
  *  Use vinegar "which has been used to keep a supply of bird's-eye
  peppers."
  
  *  After discarding chicken spurs, wash hands with very warm water
  and Dial soap (and follow up with isopropyl alcohol rinse); wash all
  utensils with bleach.  (One should always regard chickens, even if
  processed in USA or inspected by USDA, as unclean! USDA inspectors
  are notoriously less than thorough, and U.S. packing houses often
  neglect basic hygienic rules in working with chickens, especially in
  dealing with their entrails, waste products un-excreted, etc. And one
  should not expect much better from out-of-country chickens.)

  1. In a casserole dish, mix corn, salt, sugar and butter. Beat eggs
  and add to milk. Stir into the corn mixture. Preheat oven to 450
  degrees.
  
  2. Place in oven for 10 minutes. Remove and stir with long prong fork,
  disturbing the top as little as possible.
  
  3. Return to the oven for 10 more minutes. Repeat stirring procedure.
  
  4. Return to oven for 10 more minutes. Repeat stirring procedure.
  
  5. Return to oven for 10 - 15 minutes. Top should be lightly brown and
  pudding should be firm.
  
  Note: This side dish is so popular that we offer it at lunch and
  dinner every day. The 3 step cooking process and the use of white
  corn makes this a different and unique version of this Kentucky
  classic.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Beaver Tail
 
  This tid-bit of the old time trappers will be tasted by few of the
  younger generation. Broil the beaver tail over hot coals for a few
  minutes (or in one of those new electric ovens). The rough scaly hide
  will blister and come off, leaving the tail clean, white and solid.
  Then roast or boil until tender. This is considered very
  strengthening food (use only young beaver). For a special treat,
  cool, souse in vinegar, add raw onion rings, salt and pepper to taste.

 Categories: Cheese, Pulses and
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5 lg Flour Tortillas -- (or 6)
    1/2 c  Chopped Onion
     16 oz Can Refried Beans
  1 1/2 c  Salsa -- * see note
     12 oz Can Green Enchilada Sauce**
           -see note
  1 1/2    To 2 Cups Cheddar Cheese
           -shredded
 
  * I use a 14 oz. can of Food Club Diced Tomatoes with Green Chilies.
  ** or red enchilada sauce if desired
  
  Drain the salsa. In a medium bowl mix the refried beans, salsa and
  onion. Warm the tortillas. Grease a 9 X 12 inch baking dish. Now,
  spread about 1/4 cup of the refried bean mixture evenly over 3/4 of
  one tortilla. Sprinkle with a little cheese and roll the tortilla
  starting with the part covered with refried beans. Place with the end
  of the roll down in the baking dish length-wise. Continue with the
  other tortillas until the baking dish is filled (I can usually fit
  six in the dish.) Pour the enchilada sauce over the top of the
  tortillas evenly and sprinkle with remaining 3/4 - 1 cup of cheese.
  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
  
  Viva la enchilada! This is one of Brandon and I's favorites. I came
  up with this simple recipe a couple of years ago while in college. It
  costs about $4.75 and lasts for two meals for us. It also takes very
  little time to prepare. You can top it with any of your favorite
  toppings too; guacamole, sour cream, black olives and shredded
  lettuce. Enjoy!

      Title: BECKY CAMPBELL'S CHICKEN WITH CARAMBOLA
 Categories: Fruits, Harned 1994, Main dish, Nuts, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    3.5 to 4 lb. chicken
           -- cut in pieces
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Lime juice; freshly squeezed
      2    Limes; minced zest of
      2 sm Onions
           -- peeled and thinly sliced
      2 tb Mild honey
      1 tb Fresh ginger; minced
      1    Fresh serrano or jalapeno
           -with seeds; minced
      4    Carambola (4 oz. each)*
           -- cut in 1/4" thick slices
           Salt
    1/2 c  Almonds; raw and whole
      1 sm Cilantro bunch; to garnish
 
  *When you buy carambola, also called star fruit, look for ones that
  are uniformly yellow to orange and have a subtle perfume. If they are
  green, they aren't ripe and won't yield a great deal of flavor. At
  their ripest, their flavor is an unmistakably tropical combination of
  apple, banana and lychee.
  
  Rinse chicken well and pat it thoroughly dry.
  
  In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, lime juice and zest,
  onions, honey, ginger and minced pepper. Stir in three-fourths of the
  carambola slices.  Then add the chicken, and turn it until it is
  coated with the marinade.  Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to
  2 days, turning the chicken occasionally so it marinates evenly.
  
  Arrange chicken in a single layer in a 9 x 13" baking dish; season
  generously with salt.  Add almonds to the marinade, stir, and spoon
  it over the chicken.  Bake at 375 F. in the center of the oven,
  basting frequently with pan juices and turning any chicken pieces
  that get too brown, about 35 minutes.  Add remaining carambola, stir,
  and continue cooking until the chicken is golden and a thigh yields
  clear juice when pricked at its thickest part, 15 to 20 minutes.
  Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. Just before serving, mince
  the cilantro if you are using it. Serve chicken right from the baking
  dish, or divide among four warmed dinner plates. Spoon sauce over the
  chicken, garnish with cilantro and serve.
  
  This dish can be prepared up to 2 days in advance. Goes well with a
  semi-dry German Kabinett, such as Deirhard 1989.
  
  Loomis writes:  "Becky Campbell became a tropical fruit aficionado
  through the career of her husband, Carl, who is an internationally
  known tropical fruit expert. He researched and taught at the
  University of Florida, where he is now professor emeritus.  She
  became an expert on cooking with tropical fruits, and lectured and
  taught cooking classes for years. Together they developed a small
  tropical fruit orchard in the backyard of their home near Homestead,
  Florida.
  
  "Becky refers to the tropical fruit orchard that surrounds their
  single-story home as a 'mini experiment station.' Her husband does the
  experimenting, and she brings the bounty into the kitchen. Their
  orchard produces everything from Key limes and carambola to black
  sapote and mangoes.
  
  "Becky and Carl were recently in Uganda, where carambola is as common
  as green grapes are here. There she picked up valuable tips for using
  the lovely star-shaped fruit, and she set out samples for us to
  taste: golden star-shaped slices of dried carambola, carambola
  leather and carambola preserves, where the stars were suspended in a
  thick sweet syrup. They were all delicious."

 Categories: Beans, Chili, Ground beef, Diabetic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Pinto Beans
      1    Onion, chopped
      1    Green Pepper, chopped
      1 lb Ground Beef, extra lean -or-
           -Ground Turkey
      2    To 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
      1 tb Chili Powder
      2 ts Cumin
      2 ts Cayenne Pepper (optional)
     28 oz Can Tomatoes, drained
      6 oz Can Tomato Sauce
 
  ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' '' Preheat
  oven to 400 deg F.
   In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt.
  In another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with the melted butter
  until it dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine the wet with the
  dry ingredients and work together to form a soft dough. Turn the
  dough out onto a well-floured board and knead for a minute or so.
  Divide the dough into 2 equal parts, form into smooth balls, and roll
  out to to fit the bottom of a pie pan. Place the rounds of dough in 2
  lightly oiled pie pans. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until dough is
  golden brown.
   In the meantime, combine the crushed strawberries with the remaining
  3 T sugar in a small bowl. Cover until ready to use.
   Allow the baked dough to cool until it is just warm to the touch.
  Place 1 round on a serving plate, spread it with the berries, and top
  with the other round of dough. Cut into wedges to serve; this is best
  served fresh and warm. Top each serving with a bit of cold, stiffly
  beaten heavy cream if you'd like.
   Sprinkle sliced strawberries with sugar; set aside.
   Beat milk with lemon juice until thick. Fold in strawberries and
  whipped cream. Divide among crepes; fold. Garnish with additional
  whipped cream and a strawberry centered on the cream. Yields 6
  servings.
   Soak gelatin in milk, in custard cup. Set cup in boiling water; stir
  until gelatin is completely dissolved.
   Combine yogurt, sugar, and salt. Stir in gelatin mixture. Stir in
  berries and lemon juice. Chill until slightly thickened; beat until
  foamy. Fold in whipped cream. Pour mixture in metal ice-cube tray.
  Cover with foil; freeze.
   NOTE: I have also made this with approx 1/2 of 1 pint of fresh
  strawberries, well crushed. I then froze it in a Donvier ice cream
  maker. Delicious! * hulled, cleaned, and halved
  
   Combine strawberries and sugar. Cover; let stand 15 minutes.
   Prepare topping. Beat together yolks, 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla,
  nutmeg, and brandy until smooth. Fold in yopurt.
   Spoon strawberries into 4 sherbert dishes. Cover with topping;
  garnish with almonds and chocolate. Yield 4 servings.

  *(Flank steak, top sirloin, or tenderloin), sliced across grain into

  seasoning sauce ingredients in a cup) Thoroughly mix beef with
  marinade and marinate for 30 minutes.  Heat wok over highest heat,

   Add ginger and salt and toss a few seconds.  Add broccoli and
  stirfry one minute, then add water, turn heat to med-high, cover, and
  steam until crisp tender.
   Uncover and turn heat to high, stir frying until water is evaporated.
  Remove broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without rinsing) and,
  when hot, add remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and stirfry until
  lightly browned but not cooked through.  Do not stirfry too
  vigorously or meat will not brown, it is better to press slices
  against sides of wok to sear. Add broccoli to wok and toss.  When
  hot, stir in seasoning sauce and stir until sauce thickens (it's a
  good idea to whisk the sauce in the cup just before you hurl it into
  the wok). Turn onto a platter and drizzle sesame oil over the top.
  The sugar in the marinade and seasoning sauce acts as a floor
  enhancer rather than a sweetener. I hope you enjoy this recipe.

  This recipe is an excellent use for leftover beef. Though there are
  several variations possible for a Miroton (mushrooms, tomatoes,
  garlic), the predominate flavor is always onions, which are made into
  a sharp sauce. Preferably, the leftover beef will be from a
  pot-au-few that has been tenderized by long poaching, but roast beef
  can work as well. It will just need more baking time. The following
  is my favorite variation for a Miroton:
        Make sure the beef is chilled for easy slicing. Then, slice as
  thinly as possible. Set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter
  and lightly saute the onions. When golden and very soft, about 10
  minutes, sprinkle them with enough flour to make a light roux. Stir
  the mixture thoroughly for 2 - 3 minutes before adding the vinegar
  and mustard. Continue stirring, adding enough stock or Pot-au-Feu
  broth to make a thin sauce. Add the spices. Bring the sauce to a
  boil, then lower heat and simmer for about 30 minutes.
        Assembly: Pour a layer of sauce into a shallow baking dish.
  Layer meat slices, always overlapping, alternating with more of the
  sauce. You should end up with a final layer of sauce. Bake, covered,
  in a 350 degree oven for half an hour, if meat was originally
  poached, or for an hour, if roast beef. Check to make sure sauce does
  not reduce too much. Add more stock if necessary.
        When preliminary cooking is finished, sprinkle surface of dish
  with a thick coating of fresh bread crumbs. Spoon just enough butter
  over crumbs to moisten them. Return to oven for about 30 more
  minutes, or until a golden crust forms. Sprinkle the top with the
  parsley to garnish, and squeeze over it the juice of half a lemon.
  Serve at once.
        Variations: Add tomatoes, garlic, and/or mushrooms. Instead of
  vinegar, use a little grated horseradish. In place of some of the
  stock, use wine. This dish is very flexible. It is also economical,
  but it doesn't taste like it!

      Title: BEEF & VEGETABLE KABOBS
 Categories: Barbecue, Beef, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 -10 skewer
 
      1 lb Top round steak; cut into
           -1.5 inch chunks
      1 md Spanish or vidalia onions;
           -quartered and separated
      3 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Salad or olive oil
      1 tb Chili sauce
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
      1 md Zucchini
      1 md Straight-neck squash
      1 md Red or green pepper
    1/2 lb Medium mushrooms
    1/2 lb Cherry tomatoes
    3/4 c  Italian dressing
 
  1. In a medium sized bowl, mix the first 7 ingredients. Cover mixture
  and refrigerate at least 2 house, stirring occasionally.
  
  2. About 1 hour before serving, prepare the grill for barbecuing.
  
  3. Cut zucchini and yellow squash into 1 inch chunks. Cut pepper into
  1 inch pieces. On long skewers, alternately thread zucchini, yellow
  squash, peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms. (I usually  use only one
  tomato and 1 mushroom  per skewer to keep the weight down.)
  
  On separate skewers, alternately thread beef and onions. Save the
  marinade for later.
  
  4. Place vegetable and meat skewers on grill over medium heat. If you
  have a 2-level grill, place the meat skewers on the lower level and
  the vegetable skewers on the top level.
  
  Cook about 10 minutes, brushing the meat and onions with the reserved
  marinade and the vegetables with the Italian dressing. Turn skewers
  several times while brushing frequently.( A good way to tell that the
  vegetables are done is when the tomatoes start to split.)
  
  This is a great meal  served with curried (or regular) rice and a
  fresh fruit salad.

 Categories: Vietnamese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 60 Meatballs
 
    1/4 c  Plus one tablespoon nuoc
           -mam (Vietnamese fish sauce)
      1 tb Plus 1 teaspoon potato
           -starch
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 lb Trimmed boneless beef hind
           -shank
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1 ts Oriental sesame oil
           Vegetable oil, for shaping
           -meatballs
 
  A few weeks back there was some discussion of a Vietnamese meat ball
  soup that you had in a restaurant. This is a recipe for beef meat
  balls that may be close to what you had.  Actually this seems to be
  more like a pate from the preparation.  I'm also posting a recipe for
  a Vietnamese pork pate that's delicious as well as a recipe for
  grilled dried beef. These crunchy little beef balls are very popular
  among the Vietnamese. They are served mainly as appetizers or added
  to noodle soups. Chili sauce (tuong ot) is the usual accompaniment,
  but any hot red pepper sauce can be served alongside.
  
  [Tuong ot is a paste made by smashing up hot red chilies and garlic.
  The Philippine "Sambal Oelek" or Thai Sriracha are good substitutes.
  S.C.]
  
  In a shallow dish, mix the fish sauce, potato starch, baking powder,
  sugar and black pepper.
  
  Slice the meat into 1/8-inch-thick pieces.  Add to the marinade and
  mix well.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
  Before proceeding, transfer the meat to the freezer for 30 minutes.
  Work with half of the beef at a time; do not overload the work bowl.
  
  In a food processor, combine half of the beef with half of the garlic
  and sesame oil.  Process to a completely smooth but stiff paste,
  about 3 minutes. Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the
  work bowl. The completed paste should spring back to the touch.
  Transfer the paste to a bowl.  Process the remaining beef, garlic and
  sesame oil the same way.
  
  Rub some vegetable oil on one hand.  Grab a handful of the meat paste
  and close your hand into a fist, squeezing out a small portion of the
  mixture, about 1 teaspoon, between your thumb and index finger. Keep
  rolling and squeezing the same portion between your thumb and index
  finger until you obtain a smooth rounded ball. Scoop out the meatball
  with an oiled spoon. Repeat until all of the paste is used.
  
  Pour 1 inch of water into a wok or wide pot.  Place a steamer rack or
  bamboo steamer over the water. Arrange the meatballs without crowding
  in a single layer on the rack. Cover and steam for 5 minutes.
  
  Serve as an appetizer with chili sauce.  These beef balls can also be
  added to a well-seasoned beef broth, sprinkled with chopped scallions
  and black pepper and served as a soup (noodles may be added).
  
  NOTE:  These meatballs may be frozen.  Thaw them thoroughly, then
  steam or simmer in boiling water until just heated through.
  
  Yield: about 60 meatballs.

      Title: BEEF BRISKET FROM KIP
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8 lb Beef Brisket
           All-South Bareque Rub
 
  Well, I fixed my first brisket this past weekend. Thanks to all bbq
  list folks for the helpful suggestions and recipes that made this
  endeavor a success.  Most recommendations to me, posts and e-mail,
  were centered on the importance of slicing the brisket against the
  grain. Bear suggested baked beans for a side dish and I fixed that. I
  had some input from the southwestern part of the US on side dishes,
  but, unfortunately, many of the ingredients necessary for these
  recipes are not available here in WV.
  
  Here is the way I did it:  7:00 AM Friday morning. Unwrapped the
  brisket (8 lbs.) and washed it down. Rubbed in the "All South Rub,"
  not too heavy, and as per suggestions of Dwight's recent post, put
  his heavy coating of brown sugar to it.  On to the H20, gas fired
  bullet smoker at 8:00 AM. Adjusted the flame as low as possible + a
  bit. One big, fist sized chunk of (1 hour soaked ) hickory. Water pan
  full. Put on the brisket, fat side up.
  
  At about 12:00 noon I checked it out and found that the water level
  was ok. and added, and maybe I'll not do this again, added another
  big chunk of hickory. Checked the water level again at 3:00. It was
  ok. At 5:00 PM (10 hours later) I took it off and put in a roaster
  pan with about a half cup of water. It was a nice brown color. Capped
  off the roaster pan with aluminium foil and put it in the
  refrigerator. That's it for day one. LAZY - Q,  huh?
  
  Saturday. 8:00 AM . In the oven at 185 degrees until 6:00 PM then
  took it out to cool for slicing. Yes, my mouth is watering from the
  aromas in the kitchen. By the way, in the mid-afternoon, I fixed a
  barbeque sauce, to serve on the side with the brisket. See Carey
  Starzinger's bbq sauce # 23.
  
  Now, at 6:30 sharp, the totally unexpected, drop-in guests from
  out-of-town hit the door, drank all of our beer and stayed until
  11:30. At this time, 6:30 PM, just to be sociable, I quit drinking
  beer, so they could have it and I switch to scotch. At about 8:30,
  when I was finally able to face the handwriting on the wall, and
  still fairly sober, I did manage to refrigerate the complete dinner
  and kept on smiling at the guests. Oh yes, I did invite them to have
  dinner with us, but was declined.So we hit the sack hungry and a
  little grumpy.
  
  Sunday. 4:00 PM. Take the brisket, the beans, the dipping sauce out
  of the refrigerator and let them warm up on the counter for about a
  hour. Pre-heat the oven to 175 and put in the brisket at 5:30. I
  finally serve it at 7:00 and it is perfect! Finding the grain is no
  problem.
  
  You can cut this baby with a fork. If I made a mistake any mistakes
  at all, I might cut back on that last chunk of hickory. It was just a
  bit more smoky than necessary, so the wife suggested. I agree. I like
  a light smoke taste.
  
  Anyway, if you have a water smoker, don't believe that you can't fix a
  respectable brisket. Go for it.

      2 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Sherry
      2 ts Light soy sauce
 
  *Recipe is included in this collection. PREPARATION:
       Slice flank steak across the grain in thin strips no more than
  1/8 inch thick. Mix with meat marinade for 1/2 hour. String and cut
  green beans in 1 1/2 inch length. Cut green onions the same length.
  Combine sauce mixture. Separate store bought rice noodles so they
  will not stick to each other. If you make your        own noodles,
  cut them in 1/2 inch wide strips and          separate them. COOKING:
  Stir fry green beans in 1 tbsp. oil for 3-4 minutes, adding 2 tbsp.
  water the last 2 minutes and cover. Set aside. Add 1 tbsp. oil
       and brown the garlic and ginger. Stir  fry beef,
  :         drizzle 1 tbsp. of oyster sauce on top. Set aside. Add 2
  tbsp. oil and stir fry noodles, turning and adding a little water so
  they'll soften. It takes about 3-4 minutes. You may find you have to
  add more water or oil to keep a steady stream of steam to help soften
  the noodles. Add back the vegetables and meat. Add the rest of the
  oyster sauce, soy sauce and  sesame oil. DO AHEAD NOTES: Do through
  preparation. COMMENTS: Rice
         noodles can be purchased in Chinatown by the pound. They come
  in sheets  or pre cut. You can easily make your own rice noodles.

           Cubes
      1 tb Salt
 
  If you are using fresh galingal, peel and coursely chop it and set it
  aside.  If you are using dried galingal, combine it in a cut with 4
  tablespoons of water. If you are using fresh lemon grass, cut of the
  straw-like top, leaving about 6" of the bottom. lightly crush the very
  bottom and set it aside.  If you are using dried lemon grass, put it
  into the water along with the galingal. Crumble and break the dried
  red chillies and cinnamon into enough water to cobver and add them to
  the dried galingal and dried lemon grass if you are using them. Also
  put in the cloves. Soak the spices for 30 mins.  Cut the red pepper
  coarsely inot dice, discarding all the seeds.  Peel and coarsely chop
  the shallots/onions, ginger and garlic. In an electric blender,
  combine the soaked spices and their liquid, the frsh galingal (if you
  are using it), the chopped red pepper, shallots, ginger and garlic.
  Blend until smooth. Into a wide, preferably non-stick pan put the
  paste from the blender, the fresh lemon grass (if using), the curry
  leaves and kaffir lime leaves (or lemon rind). Stir the coconut milk
  well until smooth and pour that in as well. Bring to the boil,

      Title: BEEF DAUBE WITH SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS
 Categories: Beef, Meats, Wine
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb Boneless beef chuck roast
      2    Onions
      3    Carrots
      8    Thyme sprigs
      2    Bay leaves
      1    Rosemary sprig
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Freshly ground pepper
      4    Garlic cloves
      4 x  1/2-inch strip orange peel
      1    Bottle dry red wine;such as
           Zinfandel or Burgundy (750
           -ml)
    1/3 c  Salt pork; minced
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  ;water
      2 oz Dried shiitake mushrooms
           -broken into 2 or 3 pieces
           -other left whole
     12 oz Small pasta; such as
           -seashells or orecchiette
      1 c  Parmesan cheese; freshly
           -grated
           Parsley; chopped
 
  INSTRUCTIONS: Cut the chuck into 2 to 2-1/2-inch cubes. Trim off any
  large pieces of fat. If using shanks, cut the meat from the bone in
  pieces as large as possible. Place the meat in a large nonreactive
  bowl.
  
  Quarter 1 of the onions and add to the meat along with the carrots,
  thyme, bay leaves, rosemary, half of the salt and half of the pepper,
  2 garlic cloves and the orange peel. Pour the wine over all and turn
  to mix and immerse the ingredients.  Cover and let marinate in the
  refrigerator overnight, or at least 4 hours.
  
  To cook, put the salt pork in a heavy-bottomed casserole large enough
  to hold all ingredients.  Cook over medium-low heat until the pork
  releases its fat, about 5 minutes. Discard the crisped bits of pork.
  Dice the remaining onion and mince the remaining garlic cloves. Add
  to the pot and saute until translucent. Remove them with a slotted
  spoon and set aside.
  
  Drain the meat (reserve the marinade) and pat it as, dry as possible.
  Add a few pieces of meat to the casserole (do not crowd) and saute
  about 5 minutes, turning once or twice. The meat will darken, but
  will not truly "brown." Remove the meat with a slotted spoon and set
  aside. Continue until all the meat has been sauteed.
  
  Add the flour to the casserole and cook it until it browns, stirring
  often. Increase the heat to high, and slowly pour in the reserved
  marinade. Deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits clinging to the
  bottom. Return the onions, garlic, meat and its juices to the pan.
  Add the remaining salt and pepper, the water and the mushrooms and
  bring to a near-boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight
  fitting lid, and simmer for 2-1/2 to 3 hours, or until the meat can
  be cut with a spoon and the liquid has thickened.
  
  Remove from the heat.  Discard the carrots, herb branches and the
  onion quarters.  Skim off some, but not all of, the fat (some is
  necessary to coat the pasta).
  
  Prepare the pasta according to package directions; drain well.
  Transfer the pasta to a serving dish and ladle the sauce from the
  daube over it, adding more salt and pepper, if desired. Top with 1/4
  cup of the freshly grated Parmesan cheese and the parsley.
  
  Serve the daube directly from its casserole.  Pass additional cheese
  at the table. Serves 6 to 8.

      Title: BEEF ESSENCE OR EXTRACT
 Categories: Basics, Stock, Masterchefs, New york, Info/tips
      Yield: 4 Quarts
 
           Info
 
  "To cook a heap of bones, beef and vegetables in a big pot for many
  hours and have to show for it a small jar or two of meat essence is
  truly making a molehill out of a mountain--but such a molehill!
  Possessing a batch of this essence--glace de viande, is like having 8
  quarts of strong beef stock miraculously confined in a small
  container.  Use it any time you like and keep it as long as you care
  to--it is virtually immortal if frozen and keeps several weeks
  refrigerated.
  
  Add a Tbsp. of the essence to a cup of boiling water and you have
  better and beefier broth than any you can buy canned, cubed, or
  powdered.  A little of this concentrate, stirred into any meat
  flavored preparation, adds both body and savor.  Glace de viande can
  rescue a pallid soup, a vapid sauce, or a lackluster gravy, or it can
  be a sauce base on its own. The extract is unsalted, for greater
  versatility when added to sauces and such so add 1/4 tsp. of salt to
  the cup if your drinking the broth.
  
  Makes 2 cups (reconstituted, about 8 quarts, or 1 cup of broth per
  Tbsp. of essence.
  
  6 pounds (or more) beef and veal bones, sawed into pieces by the
  butcher (try to have the pieces cut no more than 2 to 3 inches long
  or wide.) 3-1/2 to 4 pounds boneless shin of beef, cut into 1 inch
  cubes 2 large, unpeeled onions, one sliced, the other left whole 2
  large carrots, scrubbed and cut up coarsely Water as needed 2 ribs of
  celery, with leaves, cut up 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, crumbled 1 medium
  bay leaf 1 whole clove 2 ripe tomatoes, coarsely chunked 1 unpeeled
  clove garlic, left whole 2 or 3 sprigs parsley
  
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  In one or two large, shallow
  roasting pans spread all the bones and half of the shin beef,
  reserving the other half in the refrigerator.  Add the sliced onion
  and the cut up carrots. Put the pan or pans into the oven and brown
  the ingredients for 40 to 50 minutes, stirring and turning them from
  time to time; you want a good brown color.
  
  Pour off any fat and put the bones, meat, and vegetables into a very
  large stock pot.  Pour 2 or 3 cups of water into the roasting pan(s),
  then set over direct heat and stir and scrape to dissolve all the
  brown bits.  Pour the deglazing liquid into the stock pot.  Add
  enough water to cover everything by about 2 inches.  Add the celery,
  thyme, bay leaf, the second onion (stuck with a single clove,
  tomatoes, garlic, and parsley.
  
  Bring the liquid to a boil, then adjust the heat so that the pot,
  partially covered, maintain a gentle simmer, with only an occasional
  bubble. Skim off any foam at the beginning and cook everything for 7
  or 8 hours, skimming occasionally (this is to achieve clarity in the
  finished essence). The simmering can be interrupted for several
  hours, or overnight; let the pot sit, uncovered, for up to 8 hours at
  room temperature, then resume cooking when convenient. (Refrigerate
  for longer times or if the weather is warm.)
  
  After you judge all possible flavor has been extracted from the
  solids in the pot, strain them all out, pressing on them with a spoon
  to extract all the juices.  Skim all fat from the strained broth,
  which by now will amount to about 4 or 5 quarts.  Strain the broth
  through a cheesecloth-lined strainer into the washed out pot (or into
  a smaller one) and add the remaining beef, which you have meanwhile
  chopped or ground to the fineness of hamburger.
  
  Resume simmering, skimming off fat and scum about every half hour.
  After cooking the stock with the beef for 1-1/2 hours, strain out the
  meat, pressing it to extract all possible flavor. Strain the broth
  through the cheesecloth again a begin the final reduction.  Resume
  simmering the stock, cooking the ever-strengthening essence gently as
  long as necessary for it to become a syrupy substance that will coat
  a cool metal spoon; this may take up to 2 hours.  (For the clearest
  essence, skim frequently. However, the flavor of the finished product
  will be fine if you aren't too fussy about the skimming; just be sure
  to skim off any fat that appears.
  
  The essence is finished when it passes the metal-spoon test.  Strain
  it through a fine meshed metal strainer into small jars or pots and
  let it cool, uncovered.  Cover it closely and store in the
  refrigerator, or freeze it.  If frozen, scoop out with a hot spoon as
  needed.
  
  Note:  The exact yield will depend on how much collagen was contained
  in the bones and meat--the more collagen, the sooner the jellying
  stage is reached. The cooled essence will be firm, almost rubbery,
  and highly concentrated in flavor.  If any surface mold should
  eventually develop, remove it--it's harmless.

  Chinese Beef Jerky is a favorite snack in China. The flavor is a bit
  on the sweet side compared to its western counterpart and definitely
  not spicy. You can purchase ready made jerkies in Chinatown. However,
  in case there is not one near you, here's a home made recipe Ms. Yee

  Mix all ingredients except beef to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced
  beef into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 8 to 12 hours. Smoke using
  mesquite chips for about three hours and then finish drying in oven.
  If doing whole operation in oven use liquid smoke and hang strips of
  beef on highest rack and put shallow pan underneath to catch
  drippings. Turn oven on and set to lowest possible setting and leave
  for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried. A couple of hints that I
  picked up from one of the cooking echos. Use toothpicks or wooden
  skewers to hang meat by, and put a couple of layers of paper towels
  in the pan to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems later
  on.

      1 lb Lean ground beef
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Chinese rice wine OR
           Dry sherry
    1/4 ts Freshly grated ginger
      1 ts Sugar
      2    Green onions -- chopped
      1    Egg -- beaten
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2    Garlic cloves -- crushed

      2 ts Finely grated orange peel
    1/4 ts Msg -- optional
      1 bn Spinach OR
           Mustard greens -- for
           Garnish
 
  * Note:  Soybean condiment (mein see) can be found
       in Asian and Oriental markets.
                                Mix all ingredients together with the
  exception of      the garnish. You need to whip this dish to make it
  smooth, so I suggest a good electric mixer. Otherwise, do it by hand
  and beat the blazes out of this stuff.          Roll into small
  meatballs about 1 1/4-inches in
         diameter. Press some of the greens into a steaming bowl and
  top with the meatballs. Steam the meatballs in several dishes,
  steaming
         each, or all together, for that matter, for about 15 minutes.
  It is best to use your bamboo steaming racks for these dishes. This
  recipe makes about 20 dim sum. Hint:  To keep meatballs from sticking
  to your hands, simply moisten your hands in between each molding of a
  meatball. Comments: This is a quicky. Buy good hamburger and do
  something special in almost no time at all. I love these meatballs.

    1/2 c  Butter, margarine -- or beef
           Drippings
      1 c  Unsifted flour
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 qt Onion cooking liquid and
           Water
      1 ts Gravy seasoning -- optional
     20 oz Frozen green peas
  3 1/4 lb Cooked beef -- diced (2 1/2
           Quarts)
           CRUST -----
      2 c  Unsifted flour
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Margarine
    1/4 c  Cold water
      1 ts Poppy seeds -- optional
 
  Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
  Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
  servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
  served without freezing.
  
  FILLING:  Cook onions in boiling water until tender. Drain; save
  cooking liquid.  Melt fat.  Stir in 1 cup flour, salt, and pepper.
  Add enough water to the reserved onion cooking liquid to make 1 1/2
  quarts. Stir in onion cooking liquid and water slowly.  Add gravy
  seasoning, if desired. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly.
  Pour gravy over onions, peas, and beef.  Mix gently.  Pour one-fourth
  of mixture into each baking pan. Spread evenly to avoid air pockets.
  
  CRUST:  Mix flour and salt.  Mix in margarine only until mixture is
  crumbly. Add cold water and mix lightly. Divide dough into four
  parts. Roll each part out on lightly floured surface into an 8x8-inch
  square. Fit over filling in pans.  Sprinkle with poppy seeds, if
  desired, using 1/4 teaspoon per pan.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 450B0 F. (hot). Bake 45
  minutes or until crust is lightly browned.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
  wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
  together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
  food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
  tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
  food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
  immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN PIE:  Preheat oven to 450B0 F. (hot). Remove freezer
  wrap. Place food in baking pan.  Bake 1 hour or until filling is
  bubbly at edges, crust is lightly browned, and food is hot in center.

      2 c  Flour, sifted
      1 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Vegetable shortening (not oi
      6 tb Water
 
  Recipe by: Kenneth Herron <kherron@ms.uky.edu> This recipe was
  developed by Consumers' Union for an August 1975 _Consumers' Reports_
  report on frozen individual-serve pot pies.  It was the only pie
  judged excellent by their taste testers.  This recipe makes eight
  pies and can be doubled.
  
  Filling Cut stew beef into 1/2-inch cubes. Dice the onion and mince
  the garlic.
  
  Heat oil in a pot large enough to contain all ingredients, including
  the water.  While it heats, coat beef with flour. Brown beef a few
  pieces at a time, removing each piece as it browns.
  
  Add onion and garlic to pan drippings and cook, stirring occasionally,
  until the onion starts to turn transparent.
  
  Add water and bouillon, then all other ingredients except the
  vegetables. Cover and heat to boiling. Reduce heat to a slow simmer
  and allow to cook around 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
  
  While this cooks, chop potatoes and carrots into 1/4-1/2-inch chunks.
  At the end of the simmering time, stir in these ingredients and
  simmer 20 minutes more. Add peas and simmer 7 minutes more. Check
  beef and vegetables for tenderness and simmer longer if necessary.
  
  Crust
  
  Sift flour and salt into a 4-quart bowl.  Cut in the shortening with a
  pastry cutter or two knives until reduced to pieces about the size of
  peas.
  
  Sprinkle water over the flour, one tbsp. at a time, and stir in. Stop
  when dough is moist but not sticky.
  
  Gather dough into a ball and divide into 8 pieces.
  
  Assembling the pies:
  
  Obtain 8 aluminum foil tart pans (they specify 5 inches in diameter
  and 1 1/4 inches tall; this size doesn't seem to be available any
  more). Divide the filling evenly among the pans; each pan should end
  up not quite full (chunks of food can stick up a bit above the top).
  
  For each pie, roll out a piece of dough between two sheets of wax
  paper until it just covers the top of the pan. Peel it out of the
  waxed paper, place it on top of the pan, and pinch the crust around
  the edges so that it adheres.  Punch a few holes in the center with a
  fork and lightly dust with flour.
  
  Place each pan in a freezer bag and freeze.
  
  Cooking a pie:
  
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
  
  Place still-frozen pie(s) on a cookie sheet and bake 40-45 minutes or
  until crust is well browned.
  
  Notes:
  
  There's nothing magic about this crust recipe; if you have another
  you'd rather use, go ahead.  Personally I'd prefer a bottom crust as
  well, but assembling the pies is mind-bogglingly tedious as it is.
  
  For those who have trouble making crusts, the tricky step is cutting
  in the shortening.  The intent is to break up the shortening into
  small pieces, each coated with flour. Once this is done, handling can
  smoosh the pieces together but shouldn't totally disrupt the
  shortening/flour structure; it's this layering that makes the crust
  flaky.
  
  I find that the beef tends to absorb the oil during the browning
  phase and that I have to use extra oil to complete the step, let
  alone have any drippings left over. Maybe your average beef is leaner
  these days...
  
  I find that the filling isn't always hot in the center after the
  baking period, but then we keep the pies in a deep freeze; check this
  the first few times by sticking a fork into the center of the pie,
  pulling it out, and seeing how hot the tines are.

  1 2/3 lb Boneless beef chuck steak,
           -cut into 1/2 inch cubes.
      1 cn (17 ounces) stewed tomatoes.
 10 3/4 oz Condensed beef broth.
      6 oz Tomato paste
      1 lg Potato, cut into 1/2 inch
           -cubes.
      2 tb All-purpose flour.
 
  Combine onions, green pepper and olive oil in 3-quart casserole.
  Microwave at high (100%) until green pepper is tender, 2 to 5
  minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients. Cover. Microwave at high
  (100%) ten minutes. Reduce power to medium (50%). Microwave until
  beef and potatoes are tender, 50 minutes to 1 hour, stirring after
  half the cooking time. If using oven other than carousel, stir 2 or 3
  times during cooking. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes.  Serve over rice,
  noodles or potatoes, if desired.
  
  This recipe is from the Sharp Carousel Microwave Cookbook. I made it
  for dinner tonight because I had only an hour to make dinner and only
  had a roast thawed. I cut the roast into cubes, and I almost made the
  time limit, but not quite. It was very good.

      Title: BEEF RENDANG
 Categories: Indonesian, Beef
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 kg Rump steak
      2    Onions, chopped
      4    Garlic cloves, chopped
      1 tb Fresh ginger, chopped
      4 sm Red chillies, chopped
    1/2 c  Water
      2 ts Ground coriander
      2 tb Tamarind sauce
      1 ts Ground turmeric
     10    Curry leaves
           Lemon grass, 10 cm stem
      4 c  Coconut milk
 
  1. Remove fat and sinew from steak, cut meat into 3 cm cubes, place in
  bowl. 2. In food processor, combine onions, garlic, ginger, chillies
  and water, blend until smooth. Add the mixture to steak. 3. Add
  coriander, tamarind sauce, turmeric, curry leaves and lemon grass,
  stir until combined. Stir in coconut milk. Bring to a boil, reduce
  heat to medium, simmer, uncovered for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
  Reduce heat to very low, simmer for 30 minutes, stirring frequently
  until the meat is very tender and liquid has been absorbed. Remove
  lemon grass before serving. NOTE: It is necessary to stir the Beef
  Rendang often during the last 30 minutes of cooking to prevent
  coconut milk from separating and to avoid sticking. This distinctive
  and delicious curry is cooked very slowly for a long time, until the
  meat is very succulent and all the coconut milk has been absorbed. A
  close friend of mine, Winnie Quek, and her husband own a fine
  Singaporean Restaurant here in Calgary. While her recipe for Beef
  Rendang remains a closely guarded secret, this one comes very close.
  Winnie has suggested holding back 2 cups of coconut milk until the
  last 30 minutes of cooking, then slowly adding it then, as you
  continue to simmer and stir until all the liquid has been absorbed.
  Winnie says that this will stop the coconut milk from separating and
  tasting "oily". Source: Indonesian Cooking

  recipe for Hanoi Beef Soup.  It doesn't call for hot chilies, but you
  can slice a couple into thin rounds and toss 'em in. That's kosher
  (if that term can apply...) with any Vietnamese soup. Add 'em either
  when the soup is brought to it's final boil or just after it's
  removed from the heat.
  
  If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and
  upper two-thirds of the stalk, then chop. If you are using dried, it
  must be soaked for 2 hours, then drained and chopped fine.
  
  Sprinkle the black pepper, 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce, and chopped
  garlic over the meat; mix well and allow the meat to absorb the
  flavors for a few minutes.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the shallots over a high flame. Add the lemon
  grass and fry for about 1 minute, then add the meat. Cook until all
  traces of redness are gone. Add the water, bring to a boil, and add
  the beef bouillon cubes, remaining 1 teaspoon fish sauce, and salt.
  Immediately before serving, bring the soup to a boil. Pour into bowls
  and sprinkle with the chopped coriander and scallion.

        1    onion  -- cooking
        2    bay leaves
        1 cn peas  -- optional
  
  Brown the beef with the onions in a large pot.  Once the meat is
  brown add 3 cups of water and bay leaves. Heat over medium heat while
  you peel the potatoes and carrrots. Add potatoes and carrots to the
  stew pot. Cover with water.  Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are
  tender. Mix up a flour and water mixture to thicken the stew. Add it
  right to the pot. No need to remove the meat/veggies.  Stir well to
  make sure you don't get lumps. Add pepper/salt/whatever you like for
  spices. I sometimes add garlic when rowning the meat. Oregano is a
  nice touch as well. Once the stew is thickened you can serve it.
  Sometimes I make dumplings with the stew. I usually buy a box of
  Bisquick as it has a recipe on it. Unfortunately I cannot relay the
  recipe to you as I don't have any in the house at the moment.  You
  would have to talk to my grandmother if you wanted to make them from
  scratch. Isn't that the way it always is.

  Coat meat lightly with flour and brown in oil (or you can stick the
  coated meat on a broiler pan and brown it in the oven (saves time and
  has the added option of not being fried in oil). Put meat in stew pan
  (I used a large turkey roasting covered pan), add carrot chunks,
  potatoe chunks and onion.  Add enough water to cover everything and
  put in the oven @ 350 for 2.5 hours. After the stew has been in the
  oven for approx. 1.5 hours add the packaged dry gravy (no need to mix
  it with water -- there should be enough water in the stew pan). Mix
  it in well and continue stewing! This is great served with dinner
  rolls and a green salad.

           -- plus extra to taste
      3 lb Beef stew meat; in 1" cubes
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 c  Dry red wine
  1 1/2 c  Homemade beef stock
      1 c  Canned crushed tomatoes
      2 tb Ground cuminseed
      1 ts Chili powder
      1    Bay leaf
      8    To 12 white pearl onions
      6    Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and chopped
    1/2 c  Chopped Italian parsley
           -- plus extra for garnish
  1 1/2 c  Green Sicilian olives
 
  Stir the flour, thyme, 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper together in a
  shallow bowl.  Turn the cubes of stew meat in the flour to coat well,
  shake off excess and transfer to a plate.
  
  Heat olive oil in a heavy kettle.  Add the beef cubes, a few at a
  time, and brown them well on all sides.  As they are browned,
  transfer them to paper towels to drain.
  
  When all the meat is browned, discard excess oil but do not wash the
  kettle.  Add the wine, beef stock and crushed tomatoes; set kettle
  over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up the
  browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Return beef to the kettle,
  then add cuminseed, chili powder and bay leaf and season to taste
  with salt and pepper.
  
  Cover kettle and set it on the middle rack of the oven. Bake at 350
  F. for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally and regulating the oven
  temperature to maintain the stew at a steady simmer.
  
  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Cut an "x" in the
  root end of each pearl onion and drop them into the boiling water for
  1 minute. Drain them and drop them into a bowl of cold water. When
  completely cool, drain and peel them.
  
  After the stew has been in the oven about 1 hour, stir in the onions.
  Continue to cook the stew, uncovered.
  
  After another 15 minutes, stir in the garlic, 1/2 cup parsley and the
  olives.  Continue to cook, uncovered, until stew is reduced and
  thickened to your liking and beef is tender. Transfer to a serving
  bowl, sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.
  
  The authors note that "depending on the rest of the menu, this stew
  seems Mexican or Mediterranean because it is hearty and intriguingly
  seasoned with cuminseed..."

  To cook on the stove:
  
  Mix the flour, salt and pepper together.  Coat meat with flour
  mixture. In a large fry pan, wok, or Dutch Oven, brown the meat in a
  little oil (cooking a little meat at a time until all is browned).
  Place meat in a large pot and add about 3 cups beef broth,
  Worcestershire, garlic, bay leaf, paprika, carrots, onions and
  celery. Stir to mix. Cook over medium heat until it comes to a slow
  boil, reduce to low and continue cooking (4 hours or so) until the
  liquid is reduced and meat is tender, stirring frequently.  Add
  potatoes and continue cooking about another 30 minutes or until
  potatoes are tender.  Do not use Kitchen Bouquet. If necessary, add a
  little flour mixed with water to thicken.

      1 tb Shortening
      1 lb 1-in Cubed Stew Beef
      1 lg Onion; sliced
    1/2 c  Water
      4 sm Peeled Potatoes
      1 pk Frozen Peas
      1 sm Carrot; chunked
      1 cn (15 oz) Stewed Tomatoes
  1 1/2 ts My Seasoning (follows)
 
  A VERY QUICK AND EASY STEW RECIPE
  
  Heat the cooker.  Add shortening. Brown the meat.  Add the vegetables,
  stewed tomatoes, and water, and place over the meat.
  
  Close the cover securely.  Place pressure regulator on vent pipe and
  cook 10-12 minutes with pressure regulator rocking slowly. Cool
  cooker at once. If desired, make a paste of 1 tablespoon flour and
  1/4 cup of water and stir into stew to thicken.
  
  Another method of preparing stew is to cook the meat separately 8-10
  minutes, then add the vegetables and cook 5 more minutes with the
  presure regulator rocking slowly.
  
  My Seasoning: 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part
  black pepper. Mix well before measuring and adding to the recipe.

      2    Bay leaf
      2    Cloves
    3/4 ts Salt, coarse
      8    Peppercorns
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Put the oil in a roasting pan and heat
  briefly in the oven.  Add the bones to the oil in the pan, toss to
  coat and roast for 35 minutes.  Add the onions, carrots, celery,
  leek, garlic, and parsley, tossing them all to coat with fat.  Roast
  30 minutes longer. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the
  bones and vegetables to a clean stockpot.  Drain off as much of the
  fat as possible. Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat (use 2
  burners if necessary), and add 2 cups of cold water and boil briefly.
  Scrape up all of the browned bits into the water.  Transfer the
  liquid to the stock pot and add enough cold water to cover.  Bring
  slowly to a boil, skimming off all of the froth that forms.  Lower
  the heat and add tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, cloves, and salt.
  Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours adding water as necessary just to
  cover the ingredients. Skim whenever necessary. Add peppercorns for
  the last 15 minutes of the simmering.
  
  Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with a
  double layer of dampened cheesecloth.   Gently press the solids to
  extract all of the liquid, and discard the solids.  Pour the stock
  into containers for storage and label and date them. The stock will
  "keep" for up to 3 days in a refrigerator, and up to 6 months in a
  freezer.

      2 ts Paprika, sweet inported
    3/4 ts Salt

     10 tb Butter
     24    Onions, pearl

  saucepan and simmer slowly for 20 minutes, or until sauce is slightly
  reduced. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, while completeing
  recipe. Trim stem ends off mushrooms and discard. Wipe mushrooms with
  a damp paper towel and slice thin. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a
  medium sized skillet and saut mushrooms until tender and golden,

  the root end of each pearl onion. Bring a large kettle of water to a
  boil and drop in the onions. Blanch for 10 minutes, drain, and rinse
  under cold running water. Peel the onions. Heat another 2 tablespoons
  of butter in the same skillet and saut the onions, stirring and
  shaking the skillet often, until they are lightly browned, 3 to 4
  minutes. Transfer the onions to the bowl with the mushrooms. Cut the
  meat into thin slices on the diagonal. Heat remaining butter in the
  skillet and saut the pieces of filet over high heat until just
  lightly browned. Transfer pieces to a plate as each batch is browned.
  Recipe can be prepared to this point several hours before serving. To
  complete, set sauce over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add
  mushrooms, onions and any accumulated juices from the bowl, and
  simmer for 5 minutes. Add slices of filet and any accumulated juices
  and simmer until the meat is heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve
  immediately over buttered noodles. Garnish with chopped parsley.
  Garnish side with sauted cherry tomatoes and pour a good red wine.

           Dry red wine
      2 ts Dried marjoram
      1 ts Salt
      8    Black peppercorns, crushed
      6    Whole cloves
      4    Garlic cloves, halved
 13 3/4 oz Can no-salt-added beef broth
           Vegetable cooking spray
      2 tb Cornstarch
 
  INSTRUCTIONS: Cabernet Sauvignon gives depth and peppercorns give
  bite to this robust dish. You might want to use a bigger-bodied
  Cabernet or Zinfandel, which will reduce to a fine sauce.
  
  Trim fat from tenderloin; fold under 3 inches of small end. Tie
  tenderloin with string at 2-inch intervals. Combine wine and next 6
  ingredients in large zip-top heavy-duty plastic bag. Add tenderloin
  to bag, and seal. Marinate in refrigerator 2 hours, turning
  occasionally.
  
  Remove tenderloin from bag, reserving marinade. Strain marinade;
  discard solids, and set marinade aside. Coat a large Dutch oven with
  cooking spray; place over medium-high heat until hot. Add tenderloin,
  and cook 2 minutes on all sides or until browned.
  
  Place tenderloin on rack coated with cooking spray; place rack in
  roasting pan. Insert thermometer into thickest portion of tenderloin.
  Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes or until thermometer registers 140
  degrees (rare) to 160 degrees (medium).
  
  Place tenderloin on a serving platter; cover with aluminum foil. Let
  stand 10 minutes. Remove string before slicing.
  
  Place cornstarch in a bowl. Gradually add the 1/4 cup reserved
  marinade, blending with a wire whisk; set aside. Place remaining
  reserved marinade in Dutch oven. Bring to a boil, and cook 2 minutes.
  Add cornstarch mixture to pan; bring to a boil, and cook 1 minute or
  until slightly thickened, stirring constantly. Serve the sauce with
  tenderloin. Yield: 12 servings (serving size: 3 ounces tenderloin and
  1/4 cup sauce).

      Title: BEEF TIPS IN RED WINE SAUCE
 Categories: Main dish, Meats, Jaw
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Cubed beef sirloin, trimmed
           Of all visable fat
      2 ts Olive oil
      1 md Yellow onion, chopped
      2 c  Sliced mushrooms
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      1 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
  1 1/2 c  Beef broth
      3 c  Cooked extra-wide egg
           Noodles
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
 
  Brown beef cubes in the olive oil in a 12 inch nonstick skillet set
  over medium heat. Turn the cubes frequently to ensure even browning
  on all sides. Add the onions and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer, or until
  the onions are fragrant. Add the mushrooms and garlic and reduce heat
  to medium low; cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes
  longer, or until mushrooms are brown.
  
  Combine the flour, thyme leaves, black pepper and nutmeg in a small
  dish. Sprinkle the flour mixture evenly over the meat and mushroom
  mixture, stirring well. Allow the flour mixture to "toast" in the pan
  without burning for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then, stir in the red
  wine and beef broth. Stir until the liquid comes to a boil and
  thickens very slightly. Reduce heat to low, cover loosely, and simmer
  for 20 minutes. The sauce will continue to thicken as water
  evaporates during cooking. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a few
  tablespoons of water or beef broth.
  
  While the meat is cooking, cook the noodles according to package
  directions. When tender, stir the noodles and parsley into the beef
  mixture and heat through.

           9-inch pies
 
  COMMENTS: The large quantity of potatoes and modest amount of
  seasonning seems to reduce the beef flavor. We vote for a little less
  potato and an extra pinch of spice. Boil potatoes and mash coarsely.
  Heat oil in large, heavy duty frying pan and brown beef and onion.
  Stir in potatoes, allspice, cinnamon, garlic salt, salt and pepper.
  Preheat oven to 400'F.. Line two 9-inch pie pans with pastry. Using
  slotted spoon, fill pans with meat mixture. Cover with top crusts,
  cutting vents so steam can escape. Bake= in preheated oven for 45

  Wash soup bones.  Put on aluminum lined tray and brown in a 400F oven
  until well browned on both sides.  Put bones in soup pot, drain
  grease and then get as much of the browned bits as possible using a
  little water to help them along.  Add water until the bones are well
  covered. Turn on heat. Add carrots, onions, celery, tomatoes
  (whatever goes with the soup) some salt and pepper and let simmer
  most of the day. Remove bones and chop what meat there is.  Throw out
  the vegetables and skim off as much fat as possible (if left in
  refrigerator overnight it will come to the top and get hard and can
  be removed easily).  Put chopped meat back, add 3 quarts whole
  tomatoes (mashed), a couple of cubed potatoes, and about a half
  package of frozen mixed vegetables.  Let simmer until potatoes are
  done and until needed. The soup is better the next day. Cooked
  noodles can be added.

  onions. Cook until opaque.  Add the bay leaves and cloves. With a
  slotted spoon, lift the meat from the marinade and add to the frying
  onions, increasing the heat so that the meat is sealed quickly. When
  the meat is sealed all over, add the marinade.
      Cover tightly, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. After
  the meat has cooked for 1 hour, add the tomato paste, stirring it
  thoroughly into the meat mixture, and cook for another 30 min. When
  the meat is tender, serve at once - piping hot.
      This is very hot!  Nice served with plain boiled or steamed long
  grain rice.
   For a nice cooling touch you might serve with a lime cordial.
      Note: When using the hot chilies, remove the placenta as well as
  the seeds (the inside fleshy membrane) as it contains Capucin and can
  cause inflamation if you eat too much.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 ea 10-ounce package frozen
           Patty shells
      4 lb Beef tenderloin roast
           Salt
           All-purpose flour
      2 c  Fresh mushrooms, chopped
      2 tb Butter
      4 oz Can goose liver pate
      1 tb Cognac
      2 ts Chives, snipped
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 ea Egg yolk
      1 tb Water
 
  Allow patty shells to thaw 2 hours in refrigerator before rolling
  out. If meat is quite long (Lin, control Thyself!!), fold narrow end
  under to form a roast about 12 to 13 inches in length. Place on rack
  in shallow roasting pan.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and flour. Bake,
  uncovered, in 425 F oven until meat thermometer inserted in thickest
  portion registers 120 F, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Cool meat
  sufficiently to handle, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in skillet, cook
  mushrooms in butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
  Add pate, Cognac and chives. Make a deep slit in center of roast,
  cutting from side, to but not through opposite side. Sprinkle pocket
  with salt and pepper. Spoon mushroom-pate mixture into pocket.  On
  lightly floured surface, arrange patty shells in a rectangle,
  overlapping edges slightly; press edges to seal. (If necessary,
  moisten edges with a little water.) Roll out to a 16x11-inch
  rectangle. Place roast in a greased 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Lay
  pastry over roast, tucking under securely.  Brush pastry with mixture
  of egg yolk and water. Bake in 425 F oven for 20 minutes more, or
  until pastry is golden. Makes 8 servings.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Beef fillet, tied and larded
           - at room temp
    3/4 lb Mushrooms, finely chopped
  2 1/2 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 lb Pate de foie gras, at room t
           -mp
      1 lb Puff pastry
      1 lg Egg white, beaten
      1 lg Egg yolk beaten with
      1 ts Water
    1/2 c  Sercial madeira
      2 ts Arrowroot, dissolved in
      1 tb Cold water
    1/2 c  Beef broth
      2 tb Black truffles, finely chopp
           -d
           Watercress for garnish
 
  In a roasting pan, roast the beef in the middle of a preheated 400f
  oven for 25-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 120f.
  Let the fillet cool completely and discard the larding fat and
  strings. Skim the fat from the pan juices and reserve the juices. In
  a heavy skillet, cook the mushrooms in butter over mod-low heat,
  stirring, until all liquid they give off is evaporated and the
  mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper and let cool completely.
  Spread the fillet evenly with foie gras, covering the top and sides,
  and spread the mushrooms evenly over the foie gras. On a floured
  surface, roll one lb. of puff pastry into a rectangle about 20x12
  inches, or large enough to enclose the roast completely. Invert the
  fillet in the middle of the pastry and fold up the long sides to
  enclose it, brushing the edges of the dough with some egg white to
  seal them. Fold the ends of the dough over the fillet and seal with
  the egg white. Transfer the fillet, seam side down, to a jelly-roll
  pan and brush the dough with egg wash. Roll out additional dough and
  cut out shapes with which to decorate the dough. After applying,
  brush with egg wash. Chill for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.
  Bake the fillet in the middle of a preheated 400f oven for 30 minutes.
   Reduce heat to 350f and bake an additional 5-10 minutes more or
  until a meat thermometer registers 130f for medium rare meat and the
  pastry is cooked through. Let stand for 15 minutes. In a saucepan,
  boil the reserved pan juices and the Madeira until the mixture is
  reduced by one fourth. Add the arrowroot mixture, broth, truffles,
  and salt and pepper to taste. Cook the sauce over moderate heat,
  stirring, for 5 minutes or until thickened, being careful not to let
  it boil. Loosen the fillet from the pan, transfering it to a heated
  platter. Garnish with watercress. Serve the fillet cut into 3/4-inch
  thick slices, with the sauce. a 1966 Gourmet Mag. favorite.

  Author's Notes: This is a beef Wellington recipe that was in the
  recent 50th anniversary issue of Gourmet Magazine. It impressed me
  significantly because I rarely get to see a recipe that has both foie
  gras and black truffles and looks doable by me. (Your requester in
  the digest appears to be on the West Coast, so I'm sure he's got, or
  can locate, sources for these delicacies. If he were on the East
  Coast, I would recommend he contact D'Artagnan, in Jersey City, at
  201-792-0748, for the foie gras and Urbani, in NYC, at 212-941-4710
  for the black truffles. By the way, Daguin's daughter, the young lady
  who knocked their socks off at the state dinner in Paris for
  President Bush awhile ago when she served American foie gras, is
  associated with D'Artagnan).
  
  The dough may be frozen.
  
  Difficulty : time consuming. Precision
  : measure ingredients. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #

  chicken to a platter after initial stir-frying but continue to cook
  it with broccoli. Beef is removed for reserve because it toughens

 Categories: Soups/stews, Crockpot, China, Beef/veal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------WOMAN'S DAY; 2/1/94-------------------------

MMMMM-------------------------BASIC STEW------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Boneless beef chuck
      1 c  Stock
    3/4 c  Onions, chopped
    1/2 tb Garlic cloves, crushed

MMMMM-----------------------THIS VARIATION----------------------------
      3 c  Beef stock
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Oyster sauce; or black bean
     16 oz Mixed vegetables; NOT thawed
      8 oz Capellini; thin spaghetti
        sl Green onions; for garnish
 
  You may substitute lamb or pork shoulder for the beef. Use beef stock
  for beef, chicken stock for pork or lamb.
  
  Basic stew: Trim meat of fat and cut into 1-1/2" chunks. Bring all
  ingredients to boil in 4-qt pot, cover tightly, reduce heat, and
  simmer 2-1/2 hours, until meat is tender. Crockpot directions: pile
  all ingredients into crockpot and cook all day on LOW. When done:
  skim off and discard fat.
  
  It takes less than 8 minutes to assemble this stew. Then you can pay
  it little or no attention as it simmers for about 2-1/2 hours. Make
  multiples of the basic stew, then divide stew into 4-serving
  portions; refrigerate or in airtight containers for up to 5 days, or
  freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in microwave-safe container on
  defrost or in refrigerator for 24 hours.
  
  To assemble: heat basic stew, stock, water, and oyster sauce in 4-qt
  pot over medium heat until boiling gently. Stir in vegetables. Coo9k
  5 minutes, until thawed and hot. Add pasta and, stirring almost
  constantly, cook 3 minutes, until pasta is firm but tender and stock
  is thickened.
  
  Lamb and pork would be good here, too.  Oyster sauce and black bean
  sauce are available in the Asian-food section of your market. Keep in
  mind that noodles will continue to absorb liquid, so this stew should
  be served immediately.  If you're not sure how soon it will be eaten,
  cook noodles separately, thicken stock with 2 tb cornstarch stirred
  into 1/2 c cold water, and then add cooked noodles just before
  serving.

    1/2 c  Milk
      1 ts Garlic fresh
    3/4 ts Rice
  1 1/2 c  Water
 
  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare the rice with the water in
  standard manner. (I do not use salt or margarine in the preparation
  of the rice.) While the rice is cooking chop the onions and garlic.
  Saute slowly until onions are just tender.  Add the ground beef and
  brown. Cook onions and ground beef about 7 minutes. Drain off the
  fat. Return to medium heat. Separately mix the broccoli cheese soup
  and milk. Stir until creamy in texture. At this point test for taste.
  I usually add table grind black pepper and salt (less that 1/2
  teaspoon). When the ground beef is ready, add the rice and broccoli,
  and soup mixture, tossing carefully. Put the mixture in to a 9 x 9,
  or 9 x 13 casserole dish. Sometimes I top this with seasoned bread
  crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Bake about 35 minutes.

      1    Green bell pepper
           -(capsicum), chopped
      1 tb Chili powder
      1 ts Cumin
      3    Cilantro sprigs
           -(up to 6)
      1 c  Olives, chopped
      1 lb Tomatoes
  1 1/4 c  Enchilada sauce
      8    Corn tortillas
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -grated
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese,

  Cut tomatoes into chunks and  add to beef mixture (including liquid).
  Add enchilada sauce, chili powder, cumin and cilantro. Add salt and

  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple Mexican-style casserole with beef and cheese -- This a
  conglomeration of several of my favorite Mexican casserole recipes. I
  took what I liked best from each one and this is what it turned out
  to be. My family devoured it instantly and completely, and it has
  become one of our favorites. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  You can adjust the seasonings to suit your own tastes; I listed
  conservative amounts (for me, anyway!). You can also add salsa
  (homemade is best) to the casserole, if desired. Serve with fried
  rice (plain or flavored) and green salad.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: BEEKEEPER'S CABBAGE
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Red cabbage (1-1/2 to 2 lbs)
      1    Onion
      1    Parsnip
      1 lg Apple
      1 tb Honey
    1/2 oz Butter
      2 tb Fruit vinegar (or more)
           -- preferably raspberry
           Caraway seeds
    1/4 pt Yoghurt or sour cream, opt.
 
  Cut cabbage into quarters.  Remove and discard the tough central
  stalk. Shred the cabbage and put it into a large mixing bowl. Peel
  and finely chop the onion and add it to the cabbage. Cut the parsnip
  and apple into small pieces, peeling them first if you wish, and add
  them to the bowl. Drizzle on the honey.  Add a good seasoning of salt
  and pepper and scant 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds.  Sprinkle on the
  vinegar , use 3 tablespoons if the apple you are using is the dessert
  variety, just 2 tablespoons if it is a cooking apple. Mix everything
  together well using your hands ~- a little messy, but spoons are not
  as effective -- then pile the mixture into a buttered casserole.  Lay
  a sheet of thickly buttered greaseproof paper directly on top of the
  vegetables and cover the casserole with a well fitting lid to prevent
  drying out.
  
      Cook at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for about 2-1/2 hours until the
  vegetables are beautifully tender, if possible stir the mixture once
  or twice as it cooks. Remove the greaseproof paper and check seasoning
  immediately before serving.  Serve the vegetable mixture just as it
  is, or top at the last minute with 1/4 pint cold creamy yoghurt or
  soured cream into which you have stirred a few bruised and lightly
  crushed caraway seeds.  Or hand round the bowl of flavoured cream
  separately, so that those who want it can help themselves.

      Title: BEER BATTER HALIBUT
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -couple of pounds of
           -halibut
           -enough cooking oil to
           -allow deep frying
      1 c  Flour
           -one 12-ounce bottle of
           -beer
      1 tb Of paprika and 1 1/2 tsp
           -salt
 
  For this batter, good quality, light-colored beers work best. The
  flavor of dark beers is too strong.
  
  Cut halibut into 1-inch-thick chunks. Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer to
  375 degrees F. Make batter by combining remaining ingredients. Dip
  the halibut into the batter and drop the pieces into the hot oil a
  few at a time. Cook the fish chunks until the batter is golden brown
  ~ just a few minutes. Halibut overcooks easily, so try not to overdo
  it. Remove the fish pieces from the oil and drain on paper towels;
  serve piping hot with your favorite accompaniments.

  in half to form into a fantail shape. Sprinkle with fresh lemon juice
  and a little salt. Holding the shrimp by their tails, dip them into
  the flour first and then into the beer batter. Deep-fry in vegetable
  oil at 350 degrees. Be careful to place the shrimp one at a time into
  the oil so that the do not stick together. Fry until crisp and golden
  brown, a few minutes should do it. Serve with Orange Marmalade Sauce.
  Garnish the platter with orange slices and fresh parsley. Serves 2-4,

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 pk Dry yeast
    1/2 c  Lukewarm water
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Salt
     12 oz Great western beer, heated
           -to lukewarm
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 ts Sage
      2 ts Thyme
      3 ts Savory
      1 sm Onion, grated
      7 c  Flour (approximately)
 
  Sprinkle the yeast over the lukewarm water and stir to dissolve.
  combine the heated beer, sugar, salt and melted butter with the yeast
  mixture. Add the eggs, sage, thyme, savory, grated onion and 4 cups
  of the flour and beat until the mixture is smooth. Add enough
  remaining flour until the mixture becomes difficult to beat. Turn
  dough out onto a lightly floured board and begin kneading, adding
  enough of the remaining flour so that the dough does not stick to
  your hands or the board. Continue to knead until the dough is smooth
  and elastic. Place the dough in a oiled bowl, cover it with a damp
  cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. About 1 1/2
  hours.
      When the dough has risen, punch it down and let it rest for 10 -
  15 minutes.  Divide the dough in two pieces and shape each one into a
  round loaf.  Place each in a loaf pan and let rise until double. Bake
  the loaves in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes. Remove the
  loaves from pans, and let cool on wire racks.
      This bread should be served slightly warm.  You may also freeze
  the loaves and reheat as needed.  This dough also makes wonderful
  dinner rolls or hamburger buns Makes 2 loaves

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Re: Pickled eggs and beets
  
  Here's a neat little trick that you may or may not know, Neysa. When
  you drop the [hard cooked] eggs into the beet juice, DO NOT peel
  them. Instead, bash them around a bit to crack the shells really
  well, then drop 'em, shells still on, in the juice.
  
  Drain and shell before serving.  (Sorry for insulting your
  intelligence with the last direction, but someone, somewhere out
  there is going to miss this step
  :-)
  
  The result is a pickled egg that looks remarkably like the pretty
  marble eggs you can buy for decoration. They make a beautiful garnish
  for a cold meat platter, and amazing looking deviled eggs.

      Title: BEET SALAD WITH ORANGE & TARRAGON
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        8 sm to medium-sized beets
  :          For the dressing:
        2 TB extra-virgin olive oil
        3 TB freshly squeezed orange
  :          juice, -- preferably from a
  :          bloo
        2 TB balsamic vinegar
        1 ts freshly grated orange zest
        1 TB finely snipped fresh
  :          tarragon or -- 2 teaspoons
  :          dried ta
  :          Salt and freshly milled
  :          black pepper
  
  Trim the leaves off the beets, but do not remove the tops or pierce
  the beets themselves, or their juice will bleed into the water and
  flavor and color will be lost. Fill a saucepan with enough water to
  cover the beets generously and bring to a rapid boil. Add the beets
  and reduce the heat so that the beets boil gently until tender, 20 to
  30 minutes. When you can pierce them easily with a sharp knife, thin
  skewer, or, better yet, a cake tester, they are done. (Try to use
  something as thin as possible to prevent the beets from bleeding
  excessively when they are pierced.) They should be tender but not
  mushy.
  
  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine all the dressing ingredients,
  including salt and pepper to taste. Whisk to blend. When the beets
  are cooked, drain them into cold water to cool so they can be
  handled. Drain again and cut off the tops and slip off the skins. Cut
  into 1/4-inch thick slices and place in a salad bowl. Pour over the
  dressing, toss well, and serve. The beets can also be left to
  marinate at room temperature for several hours.
  
  Ahead-of-time note: This entire dish can be prepared a day in advance,
  covered, and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before serving.

      Title: BEET SOUP WITH SAGE & SHALLOTS
 Categories: Vegetables, August, Lacto
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 bn Small organic beets (about 4
           Or 5 beets)
           (leave the stems on up to 2
           Or 3 inches, but wash well
           Around them)
        x  Assorted leftover
           Cruciferous veggie stems
           (optional, I used broccoli
           And cauliflower stems,
           Peeled)
    1/2 c  Rice vinegar (unsweetened)
        x  One day, or a few hours
           (optional)
      4    Sage leaves
    1/2 c  White zinfandel or other
           White wine
      2 lg Shallot cloves
      4 sm Cloves garlic
      1 tb Canola oil
        x  Salt
        x  Pepper, fresh crushed
        x  Few drops maple syrup
      2 tb Creme fraiche (similar to
           Sour cream)
 
  Thickly slice the beets and simmer in water ~30 minutes until cooked.
  Include the stems of leftover cruciferous veggies in this simmer.
  Strain and place in a bowl with 1/2 c rice vinegar and water to
  cover. Let sit overnight in the refrigerator, or for as long as you
  can. Use the beet leaves for making a green veggie to eat.
  
  The next day, or later: Strain the beets from this liquid, place in a
  food processor with sage leaves (stems removed). Process, adding a
  little wine or water as needed. (Discard the vinegar, or save it for
  the next batch of vinegared beets, in the fridge).
  
  Slice the shallots and garlic.  Saute in a little of the canola oil,
  with the shallots first, then later add the garlic (in order to avoid
  overtoasting the garlic). After about 4 or 5 minutes, add the wine.
  Simmer a minute or two.  Add this mixture to the food processor and
  continue processing.  It is nicer if some graininess remains, but a
  fine graininess.
  
  Place this mixture back in a pan.  Add about 1 or 2 cups of hot water,
  remaining canola oil, and salt (1/4 tsp) and pepper to taste. Stir and
  simmer a few minutes, add 3 drops maple syrup. Pour into 2 regular or
  1 large wide soupbowl, leave room on top.  Top with 1 or 2 T creme
  fraiche, and stir in well.  Serve hot.

 Categories: Digest, Nov., Ornish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Beets (about 4 medium)
      1 lb Carrots, sliced
      2 tb Grated fresh gingerroot
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Orange juice
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
        x  Grated zest of 1 orange
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Mace
 
  Wash the beets well and cut off the leaves, leaving an inch or so of
  stem. Cover with cold water, bring to a boil and simmer, covered
  until tender, about 40 minutes. Drain and cover with cool or lukewarm
  water. When cool enough to handle, slip off the skins. Cut the beets
  into slices or chunks.
  
  Peel and cut the carrots into slices or chunks, resemling the beets
  in size and
  
  style.  Steam or boil in lightly salted water about 5 minutes or until
  tender but not soft. Drain.
  
  Combine the ginger, sugar, orange juice, vinegar, orange zest and
  spices in a saucepan and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook until
  thickened. Simmer the cooked beets and carrots in this sauce for
  about 5 minutes.
  
  Note:  Alternatively, you may bake the beets in a foil-covered pan for
  about an
  
  hour.  When cool, slip off the skins.  Cut the beets into slices or
  chunks.
  
  Since I didn't want to waste the beet tops, I sliced the green beet
  tops and steamed them and when I combined the sauce with the cooked
  beets and carrots, I
  
  also added the steamed beet tops.

  hour.  When cool, slip off the skins.  Cut the beets into slices or
  chunks.
  
  Since I didn't want to waste the beet tops, I sliced the green beet
  tops and steamed them and when I combined the sauce with the cooked
  beets and carrots, I
  
  also added the steamed beet tops.
  
  This came from the Eat More, Weigh Less book by Dr. Dean Ornish.

      Title: BEGGAR'S CHICKEN
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Frying chicken
      3    Dried lotus leaves
      4 lb Wet modeling clay

MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      2 tb Salted mustard green,
           Minced
      1 tb Peanut oil
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Fresh ginger root, minced

MMMMM----------------------MIXTURE FOR SKIN---------------------------
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Medium sherry
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
 
  Prepare Chicken:  Trim excess fat from chicken; remove wing tips. Mix
  mixture for skin; rub chicken inside & out with it. Leave uncovered
  at room temperature, while coating is absorbed and dried. Repeat if
  necessary.
  
  Stuffing:  In hot wok, heat peanut oil to smoking. Stir-fry ground
  pork 2 minutes; add mustard green, ginger & sugar; stir-fry 1 more
  minute. Remove & cool.
  
  Lotus Leaves:  Number of leaves depends on their size & that of
  chicken. Reduce heat under boiling water to simmer, & steep leaves
  for 3-5 minutes, until wet through & pliable (no longer or leaves may
  shred). Now soak in cold water for 10 minutes, or longer, until time
  to use them; open folded leaves in cold water to wash them.
  
  Wrap Chicken:  Preheat oven to 550 degrees.  Stuff chicken with pork
  mixture. Cut hard center out of lotus leaves, then slit along fold
  about 3" on each side of center, so cut away center can be
  overlapped. Wrap chicken in 3 layers of lotus leaves.  Tie securely
  with piece of cotton or fiber string (don't use nylon; it might
  melt). Spread soft, wet modeling clay about 1/2" thick on sheet of
  newspaper.  Bring clay pack around chicken & seal.  Remove newspaper.
  (Use foil if clay unavailable.)
  
  Roasting:  Place clay-covered chicken on rack in shallow roasting pan
  in preheated oven.  Bake for 1 hour; reduce heat to 350 degrees &
  bake for another 1
      1/2    hours.
  
  Serve:  Present fired clay chicken to table.  Crack clay with suitable
  object, allowing some of steam to escape before you proceed. Remove
  clay; carefully cut open lotus leaves with scissors. Chicken will be
  very soft & tender; break apart to get at stuffing.  Serve guests, or
  invite them to pick with chopsticks.

      Title: BEIGNETS WITH CHOCOLATE & APRICOT SAUCE
 Categories: Breads, Creole
      Yield: 30 Beignets
 
    3/4 c  ;Water
      6 tb Butter, unsalted; cut into
           -slices
      1 tb Sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Flour, sifted
      3 lg Egg; room temperature
           Oil, for shallow frying
           Sugar, powdered; (garnish)

MMMMM----------------BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE SAUCE---------------------
      4 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet
      1 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
    1/2 c  ;Water
  2 1/2 tb Butter, unsalted
    1/2 c  Sugar, powdered

MMMMM-----------------------APRICOT SAUCE----------------------------
      1 c  Apricot preserves
      3 tb Apricot brandy; or water
 
  Pour the water into a small, heavy saucepan, and add the butter,
  granu- lated sugar, and salt.  Bring to a rolling boil, at which time
  the butter should be melted. Add the flour all at once. Lower the
  heat, and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for a minute
  or two, until the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat, and beat in the eggs, one at a time,
  incorporating each egg thoroughly before adding the next. Continue
  beating until thick and smooth. Allow the mixture to cool while
  heating the oil.
  
  Pour enough vegtable oil in a large skillet so that it is at least 1
  inch deep.  Heat to 360 degrees.
  
  Drop the mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls into the hot oil, frying
  only a few beignets at one time so that they are not crowded. Fry for
  about 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are crusty and a dark golden
  brown, turning occasionally with a spoon so that they color evenly.
  
  Note:  It is important that the fritters are crusty, if undercooked,
  they will deflate before being served.
   Using a 10-inch skillet, you should be able to fry 10 fritters at a
  time (one-third the mixture).
  
  When they are sufficiently cooked, remove the fritters with a slotted
  spoon, and drain on paper toweling. Place successive batches in a 250
  degree oven to keep hot while frying the remainder.
  
  Place the beignets on a heated serving platter, and dust the tops
  generously with confectioner's sugar put through a wire sieve. Pass
  the sauces separately.
  
  Chocolate sauce:  Chop the chocolates into coarse pieces and place in
  the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water. Add the
  water, butter and sugar. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is
  melted and the mixture is well blended and smooth. Remove from the
  heat, but keep the sauce over hot water until ready to serve. It
  should be served warm.
  
  Apricot sauce:  Turn the apricot preserves into a small saucepan. Add
  3 tablespoons of the brandy or water, and simmer, stirring, just until
  thoroughly heated. Add additional liquid, if necessary, to bring to a
  sauce consistency. Serve Warm. Note:  if there are any large pieces
  of fruit in the preserves, break them up while heating. Submitted By

      Title: BEIGNETS: FRENCH MARKET DOUGHNUTS
 Categories: Cajun, Brunch
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Warm water (100-115 degrees
           -F)
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Evaporated milk
      7 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
           Oil for deep frying
           Confectioner's sugar for
           -dusting (or burying,
           -depending on taste)
 
  Put the warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle in the yeast and a
  couple teaspoons of the sugar and stir until thoroughly dissolved. Let
  proof for 10 minutes. Add the rest of the sugar, salt, eggs, and
  evaporated milk. Gradually stir in 4 cups of the flour and beat with
  a wooden spoon until smooth and thoroughly blended. Beat in the
  shortening, then add the remaining flour, about 1/3 cup at a time,
  beating it in with a spoon until it becomes too stiff to stir, then
  working in the rest with your hands. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate overnight in a greased bowl.
  
  Roll the dough out onto a floured board or marble pastry surface to a
  thickness of 1/8 inch, then cut it into rectangles 2-1/2 inches by
  3-1/2 inches with a sharp knife. Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 360
  degrees F. Fry the beignets about 3 or 4 at a time until they are
  puffed out and golden brown on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per
  batch. Turn them over in the oil with tongs once or twice to get them
  evenly brown, since they rise to the surface of the oil as soon as
  they begin to puff out. Drain each batch, place on a platter lined
  with several layers of paper towels, and keep warm in a 200 degree F
  oven until they're all done. Pronounced "ben-YAYS", these are the
  rectangular doughnuts (no holes) served fresh and hot around the
  clock at Cafe du Monde in the French Market. (Another former French
  Market coffeehouse, Morning Call, moved to ... Metairie. Ugh.) When
  you hear people talking about "goin' fo' coffee an' doughnuts", this
  is what they mean. Cafe du Monde is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a
  week, and is usually quite busy at all hours.
  
  These aren't terribly difficult to prepare at home. Even though
  there's a CDM Beignet Mix (just add water, and it's as "easy as
  un-deux-trois-quatre", as the box says), it's not available out of New
  Orleans, and making this from scratch is fun. The yeast dough must be
  prepared in advance and refrigerated overnight. It seems that for home
  preparation the dough works better in the large quantity given here,
  enough for about 5 dozen beignets. Don't worry, though ... the dough
  keeps well under refrigeration for about a week. Just cut off some
  dough when you want to make beignets -- roll it out, cut it up, and
  fry for about 3 minutes per batch. Don't forget the powdered sugar,
  lots of it. Or, just invite enough people over to eat all 5 dozen.
  
  Serve, of course, with piping hot cafe au lait made with Community
  Coffee.
  
  Serve 3 beignets per person, sprinkling heavily with powdered sugar,
  and serve hot with cafe au lait.

      Yield: 5 Servings
 
           -ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B
      6 tb -water
      1 tb Butter
      6 tb All-purpose flour
      4    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla
           Confectioner's sugar
 
   These are as light as air.  Heat deep fat to 370 degrees. Combine
  water, butter and flour in a saucepan and boil (stirring constantly)
  over low heat for about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and beat in
  one at a time, the eggs.  Beat the batter for about 3 minutes AFTER
  each egg. Add the vanilla and drop the batter from a teaspoon into
  the hot fat. Cook until golden, drain and dust with the
  confectioner's sugar To be good these must be delicate in flavor,
  therefore the frying fat must be impeccable. If you fry in the usual
  bland cooking oil, heat it to 365-70 degrees and cook the batter
  until almost golden. If you use butter or part butter for frying,
  start frying with the fat at 330 degrees and let the heat rise over a
  7 minute period to 360. Be sure to bring the heat of the fat DOWN to
  330 again between cookings.

  PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Dredge the meat in flour. Heat 3 tablespoons of
  oil in a Dutch oven. Add only enough meat to cover the bottom of the
  pan without crowding and brown on all sides, scraping and turning the
  cubes so that they don't burn. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon
  to a bowl, and continue until all the meat is browned, adding fresh
  oil as needed. If the oil has burned or more oil is needed, add the
  remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pot. When it is hot, add the
  onions and cook for 6-to-7 minutes more, stirring frequently until
  they are light brown and soft. Stir in the garlic. Add the meat,
  salt, pepper, beer, sauerkraut, marjoram, brown sugar, celery seed,
  bay leaf and olives and stir to mix well. Cover and transfer the
  casserole to the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally. After the
  meat is tender, remove the bay leaf, skim off any excess fat and stir
  in the cream, if desired. Add the parsley.

  large mixing bowl, beat together the cheese, sugar and lemon juice
  until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time
  beating well after each addition.  Beat until very smooth after the
  last addition. Stir in the cream and pour mixture into the prepared
  crust. Brush the top of the tart with an egg and 1 TBLS of
  confectioners sugar that has been beaten together. Bake for 25
  minutes or until set. Cool to room temperature and then chill before
  serving.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
    1/3 c  White Wine Vinegar
    2/3 c  Olive Oil
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar

MMMMM--------------------BELGIAN ENDIVE SALAD-------------------------
      4    3 ounce Belgian Endives
           Assorted Wild or Pickled
           Mushrooms
           Assorted fresh herbs and
           Pesticide-free edible
           Flowers
           Pickled Ginger, sliced
      1    Plum Tomato
 
  Marinade: In a screw-top jar combine wine vinegar, olive oil, salt and
  sugar. Cover and shake well. Set aside.
  
  Belgian Endive Salad: Cut Belgian endive into fan shapes. Using a
  large knife, cut each endive lengthwise from endive tips to base,
  cutting to but not through the base. Turn endive a quarter turn and
  cut lengthwise again. This now forms 4 large "petals." Cut each
  quarter lengthwise again to form 8 "petals" that are still held
  intact by the base.
  
  Run cold water into center of each endive. Drain. Arrange in a shallow
  dish. Shake marinade and pour over endive. Marinate 10 minutes,
  spooning marinade over endive twice. Remove endive from marinade with
  a slotted spoon. Drain on paper towels, patting gently to remove
  excess marinade.
  
  On each of 4 serving plates, spread out an endive "fan." Scatter
  mushrooms over endive. Decorate endive "petals" with fresh herbs and
  flowers to resemble a flower arrangement. Arrange ginger on each
  endive near base. Halve tomato crosswise, using a zigzag cut. Remove
  pulp and seeds. Cut each tomato half in half again, lenghtwise. Fit a
  tomato quarter over base of each endive to form a "vase."

      1 lg Cantaloupe, very ripe
      1    Lemon; juice of
           Sweet cream base #1
 
  This is one of Jerry's Favorite flavors, but they never figured out
  how to make it in large batches. It's sold only in their downtown
  store. Cut the cantaloupe in half and clean out the seeds. Scoop the
  fruit into a mixing bowl, add the lemon juice, and mash until the
  fruit is purred. Drain the juice into another bowl and reserve. Cover
  the melon puree and refrigerate. Prepare the sweet cream base and
  whisk in the fruit juice. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker
  and freeze following the manufacturer's instructions. After the ice
  cream stiffens, about 2 minutes before it is done, add the
  cantaloupe. if more juice has accumulated, do not pour it in because
  it will water down the ice cream. Continue freezing until the ice
  cream is ready. Makes 1 generous quart.
   Variation: COCONUT CANTALOUPE: Use half the amount of cantaloupe and
  lemon juice asked for in step 1. Add 1 cup coconut cream, such as
  Coco Lopez, to the Sweet cream Base in step 2. Complete the recipe as
  directed.

           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lb Medium shrimp, peeled,
           -deveined, tails left on
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Mustard seeds
      1 ts Cumin seeds
      4    Whole garlic cloves, peeled
      1    Half-inch piece fresh
           -ginger, peeled
      2    Dried red chiles, stemmed
      1 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Mustard oil or light olive
           -oil
      1 c  Finely chopped onion
  1 1/2 c  Chopped tomato
    1/4 c  To 1/2 cup water
           Freshly cooked basmati or
           -long-grain rice
 
  This dish was popular with the Bengal Lancers regiment around the
  turn of the century. For a change of pace, try it over pasta or
  Indian basmati rice.
  
  Sprinkle shrimp with salt and turmeric. Toss well to coat; cover and
  set aside for 15 minutes.
  
  Combine mustard, cumin, garlic, ginger, chiles and lemon juice in a
  blender and puree. Set aside.
  
  Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions
  and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.
  
  Add pureed spice mixture. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 5
  minutes.
  
  Stir in tomato and cook until soft. Add shrimp, stir gently to coat
  them evenly.
  
  Pour in the water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
  
  Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until shrimp are just opaque,
  about 5 minutes.
  
  Mound rice into heated serving plates. Spoon curry over and serve.
  
  Note: Basmati rice has a distinctive nutty flavor. It is available at
  Indian, Middle Eastern, some specialty food stores and supermarkets.

      3 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Half and half
      4    Cloves Roasted Garlic
 
  To get the REAL flavor, these potatoes need to be baked, not boiled.
  Bake them in a 350~ oven for 20-30 mins. This would be a great time
  to roast the garlic too. You can either use a traditional roaster, or
  just wrap the bulb in foil and roast that, be sure to coat the bulb
  with olive oil. Remove the potatoes from oven and allow them to cool.
  You can leave the peels on or off. I leave a few of them on. Chop
  potatoes, add butter, and half and half, and mix with an electric
  mixture. Add cloves of garlic, and add salt and pepper to taste. You
  will want to reheat the potatoes before serving. Formatted by

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Benne (sesame) seeds
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Butter or margarine, melted
      1    Egg
      1 ts Vanilla
 
   Known as sesame seeds in most of the country, "benne" is the name
  southerners learned to call these seeds, which were brought from
  Africa by slaves. Toasting benne seeds develop their flavor and also
  gives these cookies a slightly crunchy texture.
  
   Heat oven to 375ø. Toast benne seeds on ungreased baking sheet until
  light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Watch closely so they don't burn.
  
   In a large bowl, mix all ingredients. Drop dough by 1/2 teaspoonfuls
  1 1/2 inches apart onto greased baking sheet. Bake at 375ø until
  light brown, about 4-6 minutes. Cool about 2 minutes before removing
  from baking sheets to wire rack to cool completely. Store in tightly
  covered cookie tin when thoroughly cooled.

    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Lemon extract
      2 c  Parched benne seed (sesame
           -seeds, I think)
 
  "Benne seeds cannot be procured in many places, but the candy made
  with it is so delicious and so characteristic of Charleston that the
  recipe is here included."
  
  Add the extracts to the sugar.  Melt the sugar in a saucepan, stirring
  constantly, as for peanut brittle. When the sugar is melted, add the
  benne seed, stirring it in quickly. Pour at once onto a marble slab
  to cool or pour into lightly buttered pans.  Mark in one-inch squares
  while still warm and break along the lines when cold. --Mrs. Rhett

  1.  Using  the insides of the red onion,   finely dice, 1/4 lb. Place
  the bacon grease in a saucepan
    over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and saute until the onions
  start to blacken.  While the onions are carmelizing, in a mixing bowl
  place the water, honey and red wine vinegar. Using a wire whisk, mix
  the ingredi- ents well. Add the cornstarch and whisk well. After the
  onions have carmelized, add the Dijon mustard to the onions and stir
  to- gether with a rubber spatula.  Add the  water,  vinegar, pepper
  (sic.) honey and cornstarch to the mustard and onions and mix. 9.
  Continue stirring until mix thickens and comes to a boil. 10.Re- move
  from heat and store in refigerator until needed. MAKES 1 QT. Note: To
  reheat use a double boiler. I put the tabasco on the in- gredient
  list if you like it. In differnt parts  of thecountry Bennigan's
  omits this ingredient.

  1 3/4 oz Ham base -- (2-#40 scoop)
      2 qt Chicken stock
      8 oz Yellow onion -- dice
      3 oz Margarine
      2 lb Potatoes -- bite size
  1 1/2 ts Black pepper
      2 c  Milk
      3 oz Flour
      3 oz Margarine
 
  Combine chicken stock in sauce pan with ham base. Stir until lumps are
  gone. In separate stock pot: melt first margarine measurement; add
  onion and sautee until transparent. Addpotato bite size pieces and
  pepper. Add chicken stock mix and stir until well mixed. Bring
  mixture to a boil. In small pan, melt second margarine measure and
  add flour to create a roux. It should be light brown in color. When
  stock comes to a boil, add roux with a wire whisk. This will cause
  the soup to start thickening. Return to a boil. Slowly add the milk.
  If the soup is too thin, make additional roux and add it to the soup.
  If you need to do this, be sure to cook the roux until a tan color.
  This will get rid of the raw flour taste. If the soup is too thick,
  thin it out with more milk.

  NOTES:
  
  *  A tasty Indonesian dish -- This is a recipe that my mother, Bep,
  has perfected.  I have no idea where the recipe originated from but
  it is a great dish that she has perfected over the years. The
  leftovers are great next day, hot or cold. Yield: serves 4.
  
  *  Editor's note:  this recipe is unique in the history of
  alt.gourmand in that virtually none of the ingredients is available
  in an ordinary North American grocery store. However, with a certain
  amount of difficulty I was able to find all of the ingredients in
  specialty food stores nearby (though admittedly I live in a
  wonderland of ethnic grocery stores and specialty markets.) The
  recipe is so delicious that it's worth including even though most
  readers will not be able to find the ingredients to make it.
  
  North Americans can read ground beef for mince beef and bacon for
  middle bacon.  You can make an interesting substitute for this dish
  by using Mexican seasonings instead of Indonesian; the flavor will
  not be at all authentic but some of the spirit is preserved.

MMMMM---------------------------METHOD--------------------------------
 
  Heat a heavy frying pan (without oil) and put in the chilies and other
  whole spices after 2-3 minutes.  Dry roast over a medium heat until
  they darken, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Leave the spices
  to cool, then remove and discard the seeds from the chilies and
  crumble the chilies into the mixture. Grind everything, including the
  ginger, to a fine powder, and store in an airtight container for up
  to four months. Most of these spices can be found at an Indian or
  Middle Eastern market; hopefully there is one near you. The best way
  to grind those spices is with a coffee grinder.  If you don't have
  one of those handy, using a blender set on "liquify" works pretty
  well too. I have tried grinding a batch of garam masala with a mortar
  and pestle, and I had to give up and resort to a blender because it
  would have taken me hours otherwise. Good luck with your Ethiopian
  cooking ++ maybe you could see fit to post some of those recipes??
  :^). Berbere is rather like Indian masala ++ a complex blend of
  spices made

      Title: BERBERE (ETHIOPIAN HOT PEPPER SEASONING)
 Categories: Ethiopia, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
    1/4 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Ground coriander
      2 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Ground fenugreek seeds
  1 1/4 c  Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
    1/2 c  Paprika
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Fresh ground black pepper
 
  Here's the pepper seasoning used in Doro Wat.  I made the full amount
  and it makes a lot.  I used whole spices, ground, then toasted. This
  has a lot of potential as a basic seasoning. I can easily see it
  being used in a curry or other kinds of stews.
  
  In a heavy saucepan, toast the following ground spices together over
  a low heat for 4 to 5 minutes:  ginger, cardamom, coriander,
  fenugreek, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and allspice. Shake or stir to
  prevent burning. Add the salt, cayenne pepper, paprika and fresh
  ground black pepper and continue toasting and stirring for 10 to 15
  more minutes.
  
  Cool and store in tightly covered glass jar.  This will keep in the
  refrigerator for 5 or 6 months.
  
  Makes 1 1/2 cups.

      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
    1/2 ts Ground coriander
    1/2 ts Fenugreek seeds
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg, preferably

    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground allspice
      2 tb Finely chopped onions
      1 tb Finely chopped garlic
      2 tb Salt
      3 tb Dry red wine
      2 c  Paprika

    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 ea To 2 tablespoons vegetable
           -oil
 
  In a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan (preferably one with an enamelled or
  non-stick surface), toast the ginger, cardamom, coriander, fenugreek,
  nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and allspice over low heat for a minute or
  so, stirring them constantly until they are heated through. Then
  remove the pan from the heat and let the spices cool for 5 to 10
  minutes. Combine the toasted spices, onions, garlic, 1 tablespoon of
  the salt and the wine in the jar of an electric blender and blend at
  high speed until the mixture is a smooth paste. Combine the paprika,
  red pepper, black pepper and the remaining tablespoon of the salt in
  the saucepan and toast them over low heat for a minute or so, until
  they are heated through, shaking the pan and stirring the spices
  constantly.  Stir in the water, 1/4 cup at a time, then add the spice
  and wine mixture. Stirring vigorously, cook over lowest possible heat
  for 10 to 15 minutes. With a rubber spatula, transfer the berbere to
  a jar or crock, and pack it in tightly. Let the paste cool to room
  temperature, then dribble enough oil over the top to make a film at
  least 1/4 inch thick.  Cover with foil or plastic wrap and
  refrigerate until ready to use. If you replenish the film of oil on
  top each time you use the berbere, it can safely be kept in the
  refrigerator for 5 or 6 months. Berbere (Red-Pepper and Spice Paste)

  Berbere is the famous, or should we say, infamous, scorching
  Ethiopian hot sauce, as well as the official language of Ethiopia.
  This highly spiced sauce is used as an ingredient in a number of
  dishes, a coating when drying meats, and as a side dish or condiment.
  
  Toast the cardamom, cumin, peppercorns and fenugreek in a hot skillet,
  shaking constantly, for a couple of minutes, until they start to
  crackle and pop.  Grind these spices to form a fine powder.
  
  Combine the onions, garlic, and 1/2 cup water in a blender and puree
  until smooth.  Add the chiles and the spices and continue to blend.
  Slowly add the remaining water and oil and blend until smooth.
  
  Simmer the sauce for 15 minutes to blend the flavors annd thicken.
  
  Serve sparingly as a condiment with grilled meats and poultry or add
  to soups and stews.

      Yield: 1 Cup
 
      2 ts Cumin seeds
      4 ea Whole cloves
    1/2 ts Cardamom seeds
    1/2 ts Whole black peppercorns
    1/4 ts Whole allspice

  Combine the toasted spices and all the other ingredients, except the
  oil and wine, in a spice grinder or electric coffee grinder and grind
  in fine batches.  This may take a few minutes. Keep your face away
  from the machine, as it will release a very spicy aroma that may
  irritate your eyes or throat.
  
  Place spice blend in a bowl and add the oil and wine. Add cayenne
  pepper to taste. Stir until thick and store in closed plastic
  container in the frig.

      Title: BERBERE~ HOT SPICE MIXTURE(DRY)
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 ts Cumin seeds
      4    Cloves
    3/4 ts Cardamom seeds
    1/2 ts Black peppercorns
    1/4 ts Whole allspice
      1 ts Fenugreek seeds
    1/2 ts Coriander seeds
      8    Small dried red chiles
    1/2 ts Grated fresh gingerroot
           - 1 teaspoon dried
    1/4 ts Tumeric
      1 ts Salt
  2 1/2 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
 
  In a small frying pan, on medium low heat, toast the cumin, cloves,
  cardamom, peppercorns, allspice, fenugreek, and coriander for about 2
  minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the pan and cool for 5
  minutes.
  
  Discard the stems from the chiles.  In a spice grinder or with a
  mortar and pestle, finely grind together the toasted spices and the
  chiles. Mix in the remaining ingredients.
  
  Store Berbere refrigerated in a well sealed jar or a tightly closed
  plastic bag.
  
  Comment in book:  This is the hot and exotic spice mixture that give
  Eritrean and Ethiopian cooking its characteristic flavor. The
  traditional method of preparation is lengthy and uses some spices and
  herbs not readily available here.  The mixture presented is a close
  adaptation, and it keeps well for months refrigerated. Berbere is
  called for in the W'et recipes and can be used in other recipes that
  call for a hot spice.

           -etc., washed)
      4 qt Cold water

MMMMM----------------------------SOUP---------------------------------
    1/2 c  Carrots; finely chopped
    1/4 c  Parsnips; finely chopped
      1 lb Halibut, cod or haddock,
           -boneless and in one piece
    1/2 c  Leeks; finely sliced, white

      2    Egg yolks
           Salt & pepper
      3 tb Parsley; finely chopped
      6 tb Sour cream (opt)
 
  FISH STOCK: To prepare fish stock, which will be the base of the soup,
  combine the ingredients listed under that heading (above) in a 4 to 6
  quart stock pot. Bring to a boil, partially cover the pot, turn the
  heat low and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes. Strain the stock through a
  fine sieve into a large bowl, pressing down hard on the vegetables
  and fish trimmings with the back of a spoon to extract their juices
  before discarding them. Wash the pot and return the strained stock to
  it. Reduce the stock to about 6 cups by boiling it rapidly,
  uncovered, for about 20 minutes. Restrain through a fine sieve or
  through a double thickness of cheesecloth lining a regular sieve.
  SOUP: Again return the stock to the pot. Add the carrots, parsnips
  and fish. As soon as the soup reaches the boil, lower the heat and
  simmer uncovered for about 10 minutes. Add the leeks and simmer 2 or
  3 minutes longer. Remove from heat, lift out the fish with a slotted
  spoon and set aside on a platter. In a small bowl, beat egg yolks
  with a wire whisk; then beat in about 1/2 cup of hot soup, 1
  tablespoon at a time. Pour this back into the soup in a thin stream,
  beating continuously with a wire whisk. With a fork, separate the
  fish into flakes and add it to the soup. Season with sale and pepper
  and reheat, but do not let the soup boil. To serve, ladle the soup
  into individual bowls and spinkle with chopped parsley. If you like,
  garnish each serving with 1 tablespoon sour cream.

      Title: BERNAISE SAUCE - GREAT CHEFS
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
    1/2 lb Butter
      4 lg Egg yolks, at room
           -- temperature
  1 1/2 tb Sauce, Worcestershire
      2 tb Wine, red
      1 pn Pepper, cayenne
      2 tb Wine, Chablis
           Salt (to taste)
      1 tb Wine, white
      2 ts Tarragon, dried, finely
           -- crumbled
 
       Melt the butter in a skillet over a medium flame. Do NOT burn the
  butter.  When the butter is completely melted, remove the skillet
  from the burner.
  
       Place the egg yolks, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, red wine
  and cayenne pepper in the top of a double boiler. The water in the
  bottom pan should not touch the top pan and should be simmering, not
  rapidly boiling.
  
       Using a wire whisk, beat the egg-yolk mixture until it thickens
  and a sheen forms, approximately 3 minutes, but no more than 5
  minutes.
  
       In a slow, steady stream, begin adding the melted butter with a
  ladle, whipping it with a wire whisk. Continue until all of the
  butter has been added.
  
       Add the Chablis and whip well.  The sauce should be light and
  fluffy.
  
       In a small saucepan heat 1 tablespoon white wine and the tarragon
  leaves until the liquid evaporates. Remove from the heat and add to
  the sauce, mixing well.
  
       Hold the sauce at room temperature until serving time.
