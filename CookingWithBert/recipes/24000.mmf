      Title: FETTUCINI WITH PESTO
 Categories: Seasonings, Italian, Main dish, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Fettucini
      2 c  Fresh basil leaves; packed
      2    Garlic cloves; peeled
           Salt and pepper; to taste
      1 c  Olive oil
      3 tb Pine nuts
    1/2 c  Fresh grated Parmesan cheese
 
  "Whether using fresh pasta or a dried variety, figure on 3 or 4
  ounces of uncooked pasta for each person for a main course. We like
  to make some extra so the leftover noodles can be cooked into an
  Italian frittata - a type of omelet - the next day."
  
  Bring a large pot of cold, salted water to a rolling boil. Add
  fettucini and cook, uncovered, 5 to 7 minutes for fresh, 8 to 10
  minutes for dried, packaged noodles.
  
  Pesto Sauce:  Blend all ingredients except olive oil in container of
  electric blender or food processor, just until mixed. Gradually pour
  in olive oil in thin stream until of desired consistency. It can be
  smooth or slightly crunchy.  If freezing, do not add Parmesan. Put in
  small, airtight containers to freeze; thaw before using, adding
  Parmesan, then hot pasta water, to heat through.
  
  Drain cooked pasta in a colander, reserving 2 tb. of the hot pasta
  water. Blend hot pasta water with pesto sauce to heat; toss well with
  fettucini.
  
  Serve in heated bowls and pass with extra Parmesan and more freshly
  grated black pepper. To complete a simple meal, serve with a loaf of
  crusty Italian bread and a salad of romaine lettuce with fresh,
  sliced tomatoes.
  
  Note:  When I freeze pesto, I put a thin film of olive oil on the top
  to prevent darkening.  Pesto turns darker when exposed to air.

      Title: FEUERZANGENBOWLE
 Categories: Beverages, Alcohol, German
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3    Bottles of red wine
      1    Piece of orange peel
      1    Piece of lemon peel
      5    Cloves
      1    Small sugar hat
      1    Bottle of golden rum
           -at least 108 proof
 
  Put orange peel, lemon peel and cloves into a tea filter bag, tie
  shut with white yarn. Hang into a copper kettle, pour in wine. Heat
  up close to boiling point, but make sure it never gets to boil. Put
  the kettle in the middle of your table so all your guests can watch
  the ceremony :-). You normally use a "Feuerzange", but as I supect
  this might be hard to get outside Europe I guess you can also use a
  grid from your barbecue set - especially the ones you normally use to
  barbecue herrings in should work pretty well. The point is that you
  should be able to put the sugar hat on it (lying on its side) and
  place the whole thing safely over the kettle. Once you've got that
  far, you're ready for the ceremony. First, dim your lights. Then pour
  some rum onto the sugar hat, best using a ladle, and light it (this
  is why the rum has to be at least 108 proof). Keep the flames burning
  by ladeling more rum on the sugar hat, until the sugar has completely
  melted and dripped into the wine. Remove the "Feuerzange" and the bag
  with the spices. Serve in heat-proof glasses.
  
  Variation: Many people like to add sugar and/or a little orange juice
  (preferably freshly pressed).

        x  Garbanzo beans
        x  Eggplant
        x  Lemon (1 juiced)
        x  Garlic (6 cloves)
 
  For fatfree hummos, I soak and cook garbanzo beans, 1/2 to 1 pound
  depending on what you want.  I bake one whole eggplant in the oven
  until the skin is black and the flesh is soft.
  
  Cool and peel the eggplant, blend in the food processor or blender
  with the garbanzo beans, adding the juice of one lemon, a couple or
  six cloves of garlic and salt to taste.  Blend it all up until
  smooth. Yuuummy.

      Title: FF MICROWAVE POTATO CHIPS
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Potato, thinly sliced (peel
           Or don't peel)
 
  Spray a dinner plate with Pam. Place potato slices on plate in a
  single row. Microwave on HIGH for 4 minutes. Turn slices over and
  continue to microwave on high another 3 to 5 minutes. Potatoes are
  done when they are lightly browned - if they aren't browned, they
  won't get crisp. This may take longer depending on your microwave's
  wattage but you will be safe with the initial 4 minutes of cooking.
  You need to watch them carefully after that. Now comes the hard part
  <g>. Remove from plate and toss in a bowl with salt or seasoning of
  your choice and let cool! It is important to let them cool so they
  can crisp up. This recipe makes a small amount but I think these are
  tastier than the commercial fatfree chips. I haven't had such good
  luck doing this with sweet potatoes unfortunately.

      Title: FF NO-CREAM ASPARAGUS SOUP (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Nov., Opt. lacto
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 md Onions, chopped
      2 md Leeks (white and pale green
           Parts only), chopped
      6 c  Vegetable stock
      2 lb Asparagus, each cut into 4
           Pieces
        x  White pepper
      1 pk Butter buds (optional)
 
  Microwave the onions and leeks until tender or saute in water over
  medium heat until tender.  Add stock and the asparagus and simmer
  until tender, about 15 minutes. Puree soup in blender in batches and
  strain through a fine strainer.  Return to pot and season with white
  pepper to taste. You may now add the butter buds if you desire a
  butter flavor.
  
  Makes about 8 cups.  Can be served hot or cold.  Keeps well in the
  refrigerator for several days.
  
  I use this as my basic soup recipe and have successfully replaced the
  asparagus with beets, broccoli, carrot, acorn squash, butternut
  squash, and red kuri squash. You can make quite an impression by
  making both the acorn and butternut squash soups at the same time and
  serving them in the same bowl.  Just slowly pour both soups into
  opposite sides of the bowl at the same time.  I usually serve this
  with garlic croutons.

  They are also good twice baked.  After they have baked the first time,
  slice the top off (this makes a delicious potato skin treat), scoop

  dairy, a little nonfat plain yogurt mixed in gives it a nice tang.)
  Add any other seasonings and/or Molly McButter, if desired, when

  O'Neill in the Boston Globe today featured them. She wrote:
  ;Fiddlehead ferns epitomize vernal ephemera. Coiled as they are like
  tiny watch springs, fiddle heads are a sign: edible when tight and
  young, they become when fully unfurled unfit for human consumption."
  Fiddleheads are rare and fleeting and thus precious. And contentious.

  In the South Folks grow up loving catfish, which is plentiful in the
  bayous and rivers.  Now it's farm-grown, and northerners are
  discovering its mild and versatile flavor.  We coat bite-size fingers
  of catfish fillets with plenty of Tabasco sauce and deep-fry them for
  a knock-your-socks-off appetizer.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- In a large bowl, stir together the mustard, egg
  white and Tabasco sauce. Add the fish and toss to coat well. Cover
  and marinate for 1 hour.
  
  In a shallow dish, mix together the cornmeal, flour, salt and pepper.
  Pour the oil into a heavy 3 quart saucepan or deep-fryer, filling it
  no more than one-third full, and heat over medium heat to 350oF.
  Dredge the fish in the cornmeal mixture and shake off the excess.
  Carefully add the fish to the oil, a few pieces ata time. Cook for 2
  minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.  Drain on paper towels.
  Serve the catfish hot with spicy mayonnaise or picante sauce. From:

  and oother good powdours; alay it vp with flour of rys, and colour it
  with saundres. Salt it, seeth it & messe it forth.
  
  125 g/4 oz well-soaked dried figs
      125    g/4 oz stoned raisins 275 ml/10 fl oz/1 1/4 cups red wine
  (not too dry) Good pinch of ground black pepper
      1/3    teaspoon ground cinnamon
      1/8    teaspoon ground cloves Soft dark brown sugar to taste 3
  teaspoons rice flour or cornflour A drop or two of red food colouring
  Salt to taste
  
  Drain the figs, reserving the soaking liquid.  Discard the stalk ends
  of the fruit and put them in a saucepan with the raisins and wine.
  Add the spices and a teaspoon of sugar and bring to the boil. Take
  off the heat and cool slightly, then turn the mixture into an
  electric blender and process until smooth.  Add a little of the
  soaking water if the mixture is stubbornly solid.
  
  Cream the rice flour or cornflour with a little more soaking water or
  wine and brighten the tint with a drop of food colouring. Blend the
  'cream' into the dried-fruit puree. Then return the whole mixture to
  the saucepan and simmer until it thickens slightly. Season with salt
  and a little extra sugar if you wish.
  
  The mixture can be served hot or cold over a sweet cereal dish, firm
  stewed fruit or - best of all- ice cream. Some versions in other
  manuscripts are stiffer and make a good filling for tartlets or fried
  puffs. One encloses the filling in pastry to make dumplings.

  Wash the figs, cut off the stem ends, and cut in quarters into a
  non-corroding saucepan.  Add the water and cook slowly until very
  tender, about 20 minutes, stirring often. The cooking time will
  depend on the variety of fig you are using and how thick the skin is.
  Coarsely chop the figs in a food processor, or put them through a
  food mill, or crush well with a potato masher. Warm 1 cup of the
  cream with the sugar in a non-corroding saucepan, stirring
  occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved.  Whisk the egg yolks
  just enough to mix them and whisk in some of the hot cream mixture to
  warm them. Return to the pan and cook over low heat, stirring
  constantly, until the custard coats the spoon. Strain through a
  medium-fine strainer into a container. Add the remaining cream and
  1-1/2 cups of the fig puree.  Flavor to taste with a few drops each
  of vanilla and Cognac or brandy. Chill thoroughly. Freeze according
  to the instructions with your ice-cream maker.

      Title: FIG NEWTONS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 tb Unsalted butter, softened
      2 tb Sour cream
    2/3 c  Firmly packed dark brown
           -sugar
      2    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 c  Dried figs, preferably
           -moist-pack black figs,
           -stems removed
  1 3/4 c  Water
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Grated lemon peel
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  In a small bowl beat the butter and sour cream until light. Gradually
  add the brown sugar, beating until the mixture is very light and
  thick. Incorporate the eggs one at a time; beat in the vanilla.
  
  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and
  salt. Add gradually to the creamed mixture. Divide the dough into
  three equal parts, wrap each part in lightly floured plastic wrap,
  then refrigerate the dough for at least two hours.
  
  Meanwhile, combine the figs and water in a heavy saucepan and simmer,
  covered for 30 mintues, or until the fruit is soft. Add the sugar,
  lemon peel and salt, and simmer, covered, for 15 mintues longer.
  Press the mixture through the coarse disk of a food mill. Cool.
  
  On a well-floured board, roll one piece of chilled dough into a
  rectangle about 5 by 11 inches (12 by 28 cm). Spread one third of the
  fig filling along one side of the dough, covering an area roughly 2
  inches (5 cm) wide and 10 inches (25 cm) long, leaving margins of
  about 1/2 inch (1 cm) on the edges.  Mound the filling slightly along
  its length, then moisten the exposed margins with water.  Very
  gently, lift the uncovered dough with a spatula and fold it over the
  filling. Press it down, then trim the edges and shape the roll into a
  neat half cylinder about 11 inches (28 cm) long and 2 to 2 1/2 inches
  (5 to 6 cm) wide. Place the filled roll on a large baking sheet that
  has been buttered lightly or covered with parchment paper.
  
  Repeat the filling operation wth the remaining two thirds of the
  dough and filling, then bake the three rolls in a preheated 350F
  (180C) oven for 25 minutes, or until they are ightly browned.
  
  Cool the rolls briefly on a rack.  Then with a sharp, serrated knife,
  trim off the ends of each roll and cut it into slices about 1 1/2
  inches (4 cm) thick. Replace the slices on the rack. When the fig
  bars are completely cool, store them in an air-tight container.

      Title: FIGGY PUDDING
 Categories: English, Desserts, Puddings
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 oz Suet
      8 oz Flour
    275 ml Milk
      6 oz Dried figs
      2 oz Dried apricots
      1 oz Dried apples
      4 oz Prunes
      2 oz Dates
      3 oz Raisins/sultanas
      1 tb Honey
      1    Wineglass brandy
           -(probably 4-6 fl oz)
    1/4 ts Ginger
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
 
  The day before making the pudding, put the apricots, prunes and
  apples to soak in water and put the raisins and sultanas to soak in
  the brandy.
  
  Put a large saucepan full of water on to boil.  Take the stones out
  of the dates and prunes (if the prunes have them):  butter a large
  pudding basin. Mix the suet and flour, then add the milk gradually to
  make a fairly stiff dough:  roll out and line the pudding basin with
  this dough, leaving sufficient dough aside to make a top.  Melt the
  honey and stir in the ginger and cinnamon:  add the brandy mixture.
  Pack the fruit into the dough-lined basin and pour the honey/brandy
  mixture over it. Put the suet-crust lid on the basin, then cover with
  foil and tie down tightly, leaving a long end of string to make it
  easy to lift out of the saucepan later.  Put the basin in the boiling
  water and cook for two hours, watching to make sure the pan doesn't
  boil dry: add more water if necessary. Turn out onto a dish and serve.
  
  (A word about the pudding basin, for those unfamiliar with them. This
  is a deep, somewhat narrow ceramic bowl, usually holding between 1/2
  liter to a liter.  Old ones have no top, so that you must seal your
  pudding with its own crust, then usually with a layer or two of
  baking parchment and then lastly with foil to keep the steam and
  condensation out, the whole business crumpled down around the top of
  the basin and tied in place with thin string.  This tying is
  something of an art, and is easy to mess up...which is why it's such
  a relief that pudding basins with snap-on lids are now being made,
  both plastic and metal basins now being available on the UK/Irish
  side of the Atlantic. Your local cookware store may have some of
  these.  Otherwise, if Tupperware [or your version of it] can
  withstand being boiled, you should be able to substitute a Tupperware
  bowl with a lid for the pudding basin.)

  This is a wonderful way to use dried figs, poaching them in an orange
  syrup and then adding fresh orange segments. You can make this
  dessert at any time of the year, served with a delicious mixture of
  Greek yogurt and honey.
  
  Put the orange juice and sugar into a pan with the spices and heat
  gently until the sugar dissolves. Add the figs and lemon juice, and
  put in enough water to just cover the fruit. Cover the pan and simmer
  gently for 5 minutes. Remove the figs and boil the syrup hard until
  it reduces. Pour over the figs, add the orange segments, and chill.
  Just before serving, stir the honey into the Greek yogurt and pass it
  around to spoon over the fig dish.

  minutes. Add fish scraps, lobster head, bouquet garni, seaweed and
  water and simmer very slowly for 2 hours skimming off any scum that
  forms on the surface. Strain fish stock through a fine sieve or a
  strainer lined with a tea towel. Season to taste with salt and
  pepper. If desired, blend cornstarch and milk together and stir into
  stock. Cook gently until the sauce is thickened. Blend smooth in
  blender or food processor. When ready to cook fish, preheat broiler
  to hot and have rack 4 inched from heat. Oil grill and broil fish for
  about 4 minutes, then turn and continue broiling for 8 - 10 minutes
  or until fish flakes with a fork. Season with salt and pepper, serve
  with hot sauce. You may bake fillets in a heavy pan instead. Spread
  with some seaweed, arrange fish on top, pour 1 cup of sauce over
  seaweed, cover and bake at 450 degrees for 8 - 10 minutes. Or, you
  can steam the fish. Arrange as in baking, steam for about 8 minutes.

      2    Sticks (16 tablespoons)
           -unsalted butter
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 lb Assorted mushrooms (a mix of
           -wild and dome

  they release their liquid. Add Madeira and chives and cook over
  mediumlow heat until soft. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  Cool. Melt remaining butter. Cut phyllo sheets into thirty six 8 1/2-
  inch squares. To make parcels: Place one phyllo square on flat
  surface, brush with butter, place another square on top of first with
  corners turned 45 degrees. Continue in this way, turning each square
  before placing on top of the other so the corners do not lay on top
  of one another. Each parcel should contain 6 sheets of phyllo. Keep
  phyllo covered as you're working so it doesn't dry out. Spoon 2
  tablespoons of mushrooms into center of each packet. Place tenderloin
  on top of mushrooms. Top tenderloin with another 2 tablespoons of
  mushrooms. Gather edges of phyllo together and gently twist. Tie with
  a leek ribbon. Transfer to parchmentlined baking sheet, brush lightly

      Title: FILET MIGNONS ON A POTATO CAKE
 Categories: Beef, Vegetables, From cook4u, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Potatoes
      5 tb Butter
      4    Filet mignon, 6 oz each
      2 tb Brandy
      2 c  Botton mushrooms, quartered
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/3 c  Beef broth
    1/2 c  Sour cream
     12    Green olives, halved
           And pitted
      2 tb Corn oil
 
  1. Preheat the oven to 375. 2. Peel the potatoes and cut them into
  slices about 1/8-in. thick. As the potatoes are sliced, drop them
  into a bowl of cold water to prevent them discoloring. 3. Spread
  about 1 tsp of the butter over the bottom of a large heavy skillet
  with a overproof handle. Drain the potato slices and pat dry. Layer
  them in the skillet, spinkling the layers with small pieces of
  butter(using all but 2 tbsp). 4. Cover the skillet closely and cook
  on top of the stove over moderate heat about 20 min. Uncover and
  tranfer to oven. Bake 20 min. 5. Meanwhile, sprinkle the steaks with
  the brandy. Set aside. 6. Heat the remaining butter in a saucepan,
  add the mushrooms and thyme and cook until wilted. Add the broth and
  cook until reduced by 1/3. Add thge sour cream and olives. Remove
  from heat and set aside. 7. Drain the brandy from the steaks and
  reserve. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet and add the steaks. Cook
  over high heat about 3-4 min. on each side (or longer if you prefer
  your steaks medium to medium-well). Remove and keep hot. 8. Add the
  brandy to the skillet and cook, stirring to dissolve the brown
  particles that cling to the pan. Stir in the sour cream sauce and
  heat through without boiling. 9. Turn the potato cake onto a warmed
  serving dish. Arrange the steaks on top and spoon a little sauce over
  them. Serve the remaining sauce separately.

      Title: FILET OF BEEF & OYSTERS
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    Filet mignon steaks
      2 tb Butter or olive oil
      1 qt Oysters, reserve liquid --
           Shucked
    2/3 c  White wine to deglace
      2    Garlic cloves -- thinly
           Sliced
      1    Juiced lemon
      1 tb Chopped parsley
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Pan fry the filets in the butter or olive oil until rare or medium
  rare over medium to med. high heat. For me, about two minutes per
  side is fine. Use a non-stick pan. Remove the filets to a serving
  plate, reserving the pan drippings in the frying pan.
  
  Deglace the pan with the white wine. Add the thinly sliced garlic and
  the lemon juice. Add the oysters and the oyster liquid and simmer for
  approx. 6 - 8 minutes until the oysters are just cooked; until the
  edges of the oysters are just beginning to curl. Do not over-cook!
  
  Carefully remove, with a slotted spoon, the oysters and arrange
  around and over the filet, reserving the liquid in the pan.
  
  Put the remaining liquid back on the stove-top, over med/high heat and
  reduce to half. The sauce will slightly thicken. At the last minute
  add the chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Be very careful with the
  salt as the oysters and liquid have a salty flavor.
  
  Pour the sauce over the filets and oysters, garnish with parsley and
  serve. Sounds weird but WOW!!! it's good.

  Do not peel the tomatoes; cut them into thick slices and sprinkle
  them with salt.  Let them drain on a large plate for 30 minutes. Dip
  the filets in milk. Dry them lightly with paper towels. Season the
  flour with salt and white pepper; dip the filets in the seasoned
  flour; transfer them to the beaten eggs and cover them well, then
  coat them thoroughly with bread crumbs.  Place the filets on a large
  platter and refrigerate for 1 hour. Twenty minutes before you plan to
  serve, heat 3 T of olive oil in a large skillet; add the roasted
  pepper strips. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes over high heat.  Season them
  with salt and black pepper. Transfer them to a serving platter and
  keep them warm. Set the pan aside. In another skillet heat the 4 T of
  butter with 2 T of oil. Add the filets, two at a time, and saute them
  over medium heat for 3 minutes. Turn them over carefully without
  breaking through the coating and saute for 3 to 4 minutes more.
  Regulate the heat so as not to burn the fat. While the sole is
  sauteeing, add a little more olive oil to the pan in which you
  sauteed the peppers. Add the tomato slices and cook them quickly
  until they are heated through (about 2 minutes).  Remove the pan from
  the heat. As soon as the filets are done, place them on the bed of
  peppers. Top the filets with the tomato slices, decorated with the
  anchovy filets. Surround the platter with quartered lemons and
  sprinkle with parsley. In a small saucepan melt the softened butter
  over very low heat; add the anchovy paste and lemon juice. Pour the
  anchovy butter over the sole and tomatoes and serve immediately.

  MR> Got your recipes and most of them look great (though I think I
  may MR> on the Pork Livers in Pigs Blood, I'm trying to cut down, but
  I am MR> that it is there), a great blend of exotic and easy to
  prepare. Th MR> for sharing them with me.
  
  Most people pass on the pigs blood.  Try it sometime though. If your
  palate is onto the more exotic forms of cuisine, I think you'll be
  pleasantly surprised.
  
  MR> I have already formatted your recipes into Meal-Master format,
  but MR> before I post them onto the Cooking Echo, I would like to
  impose o MR> a little bit more for some clarification about
  ingredients and som MR> background on Filipino cuisine. I also intend
  to post the entire MR> collection as a file on your board and the
  Salata board. After I d MR> that, it should take on a life of its own
  and propagate itself MR> throughout cyber space.
  
  Great.  I'll try to clarify as much as I can.
  
  MR> What is bagoong, and how is it prepared?
  
  Bagoong is a salty mixture made from shrimp.  It's packaged in 1/2
  pin jars and sold in the refrigerated foods section in oriental
  stores. It also an easily available import from the Philippines item
  these days. Unfortunately, I do not know of any substitutes.
  
  MR> What is patis (fish sauce?  Is it like Vietnamese fish sauce?
  
  Patis and Vietnamese fish sauce are one and the same. It's a brine ma
  with fish ingredients.  If unavailable, salt can be used as a
  substitu for the brine component.
  
  MR> Is rice or bagoong the traditional side dishes for all of the
  reci MR> or are there other side dishes that you recommend.
  
  Some tidbits about the Filipino table:
  
  1.  Rice is always served with the meal.  One of the healthy aspects o
  Filipino diet is that rice makes up the bulk of the meal while the
  mea dish is used as a flavor enhancement. You can see how this
  combinatio naturally fulfills the heart and cholesterol meal plans.
  
  2. One of my favorite side dishes to go along with a Filipino meal is
  actually the simplest of fare.  The ingredients are:
  
    Tomatoes       2-3 Medium, sliced or diced
    Onion          1/2 Medium, chopped
    Cilantro       a little for flavor and color
    Patis          3-4 Tablespoons
    Vinegar        2-3 Tablespoons
  
  Mix the whole mess in a bowl and serve alongside rice and the main dis
  
  3.  It's not unusual for a typical Filipino meal to have several main
  dishes served together at one sitting. That's much the same as a Chin
  table where a variety of courses help to spread the palate around.
  
  MR> In Pasiw Na Isda you recommend in dir. #1 "...add all other MR>
  ingredients", should it be "...add all other ingredients except bi MR>
  melon and eggplant".
  
  You are correct.

           E-mail dialogue between
           Manny Rothstein
           Dennis Santiago and
 
  MR> In Traditional Adobo, can the sauce be reduced or thickened and
  st MR> be "traditional" (many cooks will adapt these recipes to their
  tas MR> but I want to be sure I am posting your authentic recipes as
  a sta MR> point).
  
  Actually, no.  Not and remain the "traditional" form anyway. I've
  personally never seen Filipino cooks tinker with sauce consistency ver
  much.  There's more experimentation in the area of spice mixtures. As
  matter of fact, changing which leafy green vegetable is used in a basi
  recipe is used to change the character of the dish. This shouldn't be
  surprising when one considers that the Philippines is geographically i
  general region of the spice trade. Sauces, meaning manipulations of f
  texture, seem to be more of a Western phenomenon.
  
  MR> What is the traditional format of a Filipino dinner - soup,
  salad, MR> course or what?).
  
  See above for some of the information.  The format of a meal is
  basica to put everything on the table at once and have a big free for
  all. Me are a time to interact. A period in which the entire family
  becomes e in it's enjoyment of another day's survival.  The same
  atmosphere characterizes parties (fiesta's) where all the food is
  laid out buffet style. Each person then chooses what to eat and how
  much of each sele to eat from the presentation.  [The kids are of
  course cautioned not t the desserts until after eating the real food.
  <grin>]
  
  Interestingly, like many multi-course European presentations, big Fili
  meals tend to stretch out in time as well giving lots of opportunity t
  converse. The main difference is that one just keeps going back for
  mo when the urge hits then sit down next to someone and chat. More
  akin t all day American barbecue.
  
  MR> Are Achute seeds the same as Annato seeds?
  
  I'm not sure.
  
  MR> What is mochiko (powdered rice) like and what does it do (is it a
  MR> thickener or flavor agent?).
  
  It's used as a thickening agent.  It's optional and was in the recipe
  that my mother gave me.  She never used it though so as far as my
  cook is concerned it might as well not be there. Still, this is one
  dish t seems to have a duality of texture preference within the
  Filipino community. [One of those, it depends on how mom made it
  things.] I included the mochiko for completeness sake.
  
  MR> Can you recommend any common American substitutes for some of the
  MR> authentic ingredients, for the sake of people living in parts of
  t MR> country without access to Filipino markets?
  
  Probably the best way to explain substitution is as follows:
  
  Ingredient         Use            Substitute
  
  Tamarind           Sour           Vitamin C = Lemon Juice
  
  Patis              Salt           Salt
  
  Ampalaya           Bitter         beats me?
  
  Everything else is pretty common I think.
  
  MR> I hope I am not being too "nit picky" with these questions. If
  you MR> think I am, let me know and I will start posting as is
  immediately
  
  Not at all.  Hope this was what you wanted.
  
  Regards, Dennis
  
  (Note: According to "Stocking Up III", pub. by Rodale Press, mochiko r
  flour has a unique property as a sauce or casserole thickener. It does
  separate when chilled or frozen. MR)

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 pk Active Dry Yeast; OR
      1 tb Active Dry Yeast; Bulk
    1/4 c  Warm Water; (110-115 Deg F)
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Butter Or Regular Margarine

           Unbleached Flour; *
      2    Eggs; Lg, Well Beaten
           Fat For Deep Frying; **
           Jam Or Jelly
 
  *    Use up to 4 cups of Unbleached Flour in this recipe. ** Heat the
  fat to 375 degrees F. for frying the doughnuts. Soften the yeast in
  the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until it "blooms" or
  proofs. Put a half cup of sugar, the salt, butter, orange juice and
  rum extract in a large bowl.  Pour the scalded milk over the
  ingredients in the bowl. Stir until the butter is melted.  Cool to
  lukewarm. When cool, blend in 1 cup of the unbleached flour and beat
  until smooth. Stir in the yeast and add about half of the remaining
  flour, beating until smooth. Beat in the eggs. Then beat in enough of
  the remaining flour to make a SOFT (should be slightly sticky and
  light in weight). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and
  let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8
  to 10 minutes). Form into a ball and put into a greased bowl, turning
  to grease the top of the ball of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm
  draft free place until doubled in bulk. Punch the dough down,
  kneading lightly to remove all of the air pockets, and turn the dough
  out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut
  the dough into rounds using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Cover
  with waxed paper and let rise on the rolling surface away from drafts
  and direct heat, until double in bulk, (30 to 45 minutes). About 20
  minutes before frying, heat the fat.  Fry the doughnuts in the heated
  fat. Put only as many doughnuts at one time as will float uncrowded
  in a single layer deep in the fat. Fry 2 to 3 minutes or until
  lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a fork or tongs, being
  careful not to pierce the doughnut, when they rise to the surface. Do
  this several times during the cooking. Lift from the fat, draining
  for a few seconds over the fat before removing to absorbent paper
  toweling. Cool. Cut a slit through the center in the side of each
  doughnut. Force about 1/2 ts of jam or jelly into the center and
  press lightly to close the slit. (A pastry bag and tube may be used
  to force the jelly or jam into the slit.) Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at
  one time in a bag containing granulated or powdered sugar. (Your
  choice.) Shake lightly to remove the excess sugar.

      Title: FILLET OF STEELHEAD BONNE FEMME
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Head, tail, backbone of fish
      4 tb Butter
      6    Peppercorns
      1 c  Hollandaise sauce **
      2    Shallots, sliced
  1 1/2 tb Flour
      1 c  Water
      4 tb Milk
    1/3 c  White wine
           Salt and pepper
      2 lb Fillets of steelhead
           Cucumber and lemon slices
      1    Bouquet garni
    1/4 ts Thyme,
    1/2 ts Tarragon
    1/2 lb Mushrooms

MMMMM---------------------HOLLANDAISE SAUCE--------------------------
      2    Egg yokes
           Salt
           Fresh lemon juice
      1 pn Cayenne
    1/4 lb Cold butter, 8 pieces
 
  This lordly French dish is prepared in a variety of ways, but
  basically it is fish fillets served with two sauces and mushrooms in
  between. The fillets from small salmon, walleye, lake trout, and
  channel cat are all superb prepared in this fashion.
    If the two sauces seem too time-consuming just note that this dish
  is excellent if only the wine sauce is used.
  
  Put the fish head, etc., peppercorns, and shallots into the water and
  wine, bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 30 minutes. Strain and
  set aside.
    Arrange the fillets in a shallow glass or earthenware fireproof
  dish that has been liberally buttered. Add the bouquet garni.
    Pour in the reserved fish stock and poach in a 325 degree oven for
  20 minutes.
    Saute the sliced mushrooms in 2 tablespoons of butter for 5 minutes,
  coating and stirring a couple of times. Reserve.
    Prepare the hollandaise and hold it by covering with a lid.
    Make the wine sauce by melting 2 tablespoons of butter in pan, then
  stir in the flour and cook a few minutes. Turn off heat, pour in the
  liquor from the poached fillets, then stir and thicken over the fire.
  Add the milk, then stir until it bubbles. Season to taste.
    To assemble: lay the fillets on a fireproof dish and cover with the
  wine sauce.  Now dot the top with mushrooms. Ladle the hollandaise
  sauce over all and glaze under the broiler.
    Garnish with cucumber and lemon slices or with watercress.
  
  HOLLANDAISE SAUCE
  
  In a very heavy pot set over a flame tamer, whisk the eggs until they
  are well blended, turn lemon-colored, and start to thicken. Be sure
  heat is low. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice when thickening starts.
    Start adding butter one piece at a time, whisking each piece until
  is absorbed with the eggs.  Continue until all the butter is used up.
  It should take about 2 minutes, at which point the sauce will be
  thick. If at any point you sense that the is about to separate,
  quickly add a teaspoon of cold milk or cream.
    Now whisk in about 1 more teaspoon of lemon juice, a pinch of salt,
  and optional cayenne.  Taste to see that the sauce is lemony enough
  for your taste.

      Title: FILLETED TROUT WITH MACADAMIA NUTS & FRIED
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
           Splash of dry white wine
      2    Trout filleted
    1/4 c  Fish stock, OR half clam
           Juice, half water
           Salt and fresh pepper
    1/4 c  Macadamia nuts, sliced
      3 tb Heavy cream
           Oil for deep frying
    1/8 ts Tomato sauce
      2 tb Capers
 
  A very special way a doing trout fillets, inspired by a dish created
  by chef Seppi Renngli at the Four Seasons. In a skillet large enough
  to hold the fillets melt about 3 tablespoons butter and, when almost
  sizzling, add trout.  Saute on one side for about 3-minutes, turn,
  cover for a minute, and then saute the other side. A total of 6-7
  minutes should do it.
    Salt and pepper the fish and remove to a warm place, add nuts for a
  moment to the pan to toast, then toss over the trout fillets.
    Meanwhile, in a separate small, sturdy pan, heat enough oil so that
  a small strainer can be lowered into it.
    Let capers drain in the strainer.
    Returning to the trout pan, splash in tablespoon or two of wine,
  then add stock and cream and boil down rapidly, stirring in just a
  taste of the tomato paste and a little more butter. When reduced and
  slightly thickened, spoon this little bit of pan sauce over the
  fillets.
    Now quickly lower the capers into the almost smoking oil. Let them
  sputter and sizzle a few seconds, then remove the strainer and shake
  free of oil.  Distribute fried capers in neat piles at either end of
  the fillets and serve immediately.

      Title: FILO MUSHROOM PIES
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 42 Servings
 
      1 pk Filo pastry sheets
    3/4 lb Flat mushrooms (w/o stalks)
    1/2 lb Onions
      7 oz Feta cheese
      2 ts Whole cumin
      2 ts Coriander seeds
           - toasted & lightly crushed
           Butter or oil
      2 sm Eggs
 
  Chop the onion finely and soften it in a little butter or oil, then
  fry hard until frazzled.  Remove and reserve. Dice the mushrooms and
  fry them in the fat remaining in the pan; stir and turn them as
  necessary to drive off most of their moisture and to concentrate
  flavour. Mix the two vegetables together and season with plenty of
  salt and pepper. Stir in the cumin, coriander and grated cheese. When
  cool bind with the beaten eggs.
  
  Unwrap the pastry one sheet at a time.  Keep the rest covered with a
  damp cloth to prevent drying out.  Cut each sheet into strips about 3
  x 10 inches long and brush on one side only with melted butter. Put
  one rounded metal teaspoonful of the mixture near the short edge of
  the buttery side of the first pastry strip - about 1 inch from the
  bottom and slightly to the left-hand side.  Fold the bottom
  right-hand corner of the pastry diagonally over the filling to make a
  triangle. Continue folding the pastry at right angles up the whole
  lenghth of the strip so you end up with a neat little triangular
  parcel.  Make more little pies in the same way until all the filling
  is used up.
  
  To cook, simply brush the pies all over with melted butter or oil,
  arrange them side by side on baking trays and bake at 350-375 F
  (180-190 C) gas mark 4/5 for about 20 minutes, until the pastry is
  golden and crisp. It is best to turn the pies over after the first 10
  minutes and brush with more butter or oil. For even crisper results
  the pies can be deep-fried.

      Title: FILO PASTRY
 Categories: Greek, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 2/3 c  Unbleached flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Warm water
      2 tb Olive oil
           Cornstarch, for dusting
           -pastry board
 
  Sift flour and salt into bowl. Gradually add water to make a stiff
  dough. Turn onto pastry board.
  
  Place the oil in a bowl and spread a little of it on the palms of your
  hands. Knead the dough, gradually adding more oil until you have a
  smooth, elastic ball. Roll the ball of dough in the remaining oil to
  cover all sides. Place in a bowl, cover with a cloth, and allow to
  stand in a warm place for about 2 hours.
  
  Divide the dough into 10 parts and roll to 1/4-inch thickness on a
  pastry board dusted with cornstarch. Cover with a cloth and let set
  for 10 minutes.
  
  Cover a table or counter top with a smooth cloth and lift rolled
  dough onto it. Put your hands, palms down, under the dough and gently
  stretch the dough with the backs of your hands, working your way
  around the table until the dough is stretched as thin as tissue
  paper. For moist filo, using scissors, cut dough immediately into
  desired size pieces; if you prefer dry filo, allow it to stand for
  about 10 minutes before cutting.
  
  Yields 10 12x16-inch sheets.

      Yield: 5 Deciliter
 
    1/2 kg Red Habanero - fresh
      1 dl Redwine Vinegar
      2 dl Thyme - fresh
      2 tb Cumin
      3 tb Salt
 
  Remove the stems and the seeds from the habanero. DON'T REMOVE THE
  VEINS! Put all ingredients in a food processor, using the steel
  blade, and mix 10 minutes until you have a smooth paste.  This sauce
  is best when used fresh, but if you want to make enough to keep for
  some weeks or months you can boil it and put in sterilised jars.
  This makes a fruity but EXTREMELY HOT chile sauce. Be careful.
  
  Wash your hands with 80% alcohol after you handled the habaneros!
  Don't touch your eyes or your private parts before you have washed
  your hands with alcohol! It will burn for hours.

 Categories: Condiments, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 c  Fresh chervil; packed
    1/2 c  Fresh chives
      1 c  Italian, flat-leaved parsley
           -- packed
    1/2 c  Fresh tarragon
 
  To prepare fresh herbs after harvesting, remove stems. Wash well, then
  spread loosely on paper towels.  Let them stand overnight, changing
  paper towels if needed, to completely rid them of any clinging drops
  of water.
  
  Place dry herbs in food processor bowl.  Using steel blade, process
  on high until herbs are finely chopped. Some herbs may stick under
  the blade, so stop several times and stir. Let stand in fine mesh
  strainer to dry further.
  
  Yield: About 1 cup.  Keeps in an airtight container in a cool, dark,
  dry spot for several months. Use a spoonful to season salad
  dressings, sauces, omelets and herb butters. Freeze small amounts for
  use in winter soups and stews.

      Title: FINGER JUICE
 Categories: Microwave, Snacks
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Juice, apple
      2 pk Gelatin, unflavored
 
  Any fruit juice can be substituted for the apple juice.
  
  Microwave: In 1-qt square casserole, sprinkle unflavored gelatin over
  juice; let stand 3 minutes. Microwave at HIGH 1 minute; stir
  thoroughly. Then microwave at HIGH 2 minutes. Remove from microwave
  and stir until gelatin is completely dissolved.  Chill in pan or mold
  until firm, about 3 hours.  Cut into 1" squares.
  
  Conventional: In medium saucepan, sprinkle unflavored gelatin over
  juice and let stand 1 minute.  Stir over low heat until gelatin is
  completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Pour into 1-qt square
  casserole; chill and cut as above.
  
  Jellosicles: prepare juice and gelatin as above. After gelatin is
  completely dissolved, pour juice into popsicle mold or small cups with
  popsicle sticks in them, then freeze completely. The gelatin keeps it
  from dripping TOO much and makes the jellosicles easy for small hands
  to grab.

      Title: FINGER PAINT TO COAT YOUR POULTRY :)
 Categories: Chicken, Condiments, Low-cal
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -GRAMMIE'S KITCHEN
    1/2 c  Paprika
           Salt
           Garlic powder
           Onion; dried
           Pepper
           Water; to make paste
           --LIKE a thick finger paint
 
  This will do about a 12lb turkey. Cut the amounts in half for a
  roasting chicken. Other seasonings are to taste. I never did measure.
  
  Here is a coating you can put on all poultry before roasting.
  Basically you make a paste of the above ingredients. It should be the
  consistency of finger paint; thick and not runny. If you have kids,
  put them in old clothes and let them help. I smear it in and out of
  the cavity. Notice that this does not have any Gravy Master or oil;
  both unneeded in my opinion. The skin cooks nice and crisp. Remember
  to baste during cooking.
  
  BTW, use this in the Nuke too. Sometimes we do a turkey or chicken in
  there when we have lot's of other baking/roasting to do. When Howard
  was in training to be a Chef, he brought home a bunch of fellow
  students for dinner. Not one of them even came close to guessing that
  the turkey had been made in the nuke.
  
  Since this has no added fat; (no usual added butter or oil); it helps
  keep the turkey moist without adding calories. I have done this on
  skinless breasts too. It adds minimal 'calorically'.
  
  I simply roast the chicken/or turkey the normal way (usually with a
  stuffing).  The skin is crisp and good (but probably not for you).

  desired filling. CAKE: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  Sift
  together the flour and baking powder and set aside. Press the cottage
  cheese through a sieve. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and the
  sugar until they are frothy. Add the spices and fruit rinds. Add the
  cottage cheese and blend all the ingredients well.
   Stir in the butter, then add the dry mixture, mixing well. Pour the
  mixture into the prepared crust and bake for 1 hour. NOTE: Again this
  is more like a quick bread, and you can increase the sugar if you
  like as this is not particularly sweet.

      Title: FINNISH RYE BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Alcohol
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
  1 1/2 c  Beer, buttermilk, milk, or
           -potato water (water
           -reserved from cooking
           -potatoes)
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      1 ts Salt
      1 pk Dry yeast (about 1 tbsp)
    1/2 c  Warm water
      1 tb Sugar
      2 c  Dark rye flour or light rye
           -flour or rye meal (rye
           -flour with bran)
  3 1/2    - 4  cups unbleached white
           -flour
 
  Will have a more or less sour taste, depending whether it is made with
  beer, buttermilk, potato water, or milk, in that order.
  
  Heat 1 1/2 cups liquid to lukewarm.  Stir in the butter and salt. Set
  aside to cool.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water (a temperature comfortable on the
  inside of the wrist) with the sugar. Let stand for 5 minutes or until
  the yeast bubbles.
  
  Stir the yeast mixture into the cooled liquid.  Add the rye flour and
  beat until smooth.  Add the white flour, a cup at a time, stirring
  after each addition until enough is added to make a stiff dough. Dust
  a work surface with white flour.  Form the dough into a rough ball,
  place it on the work surface, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it
  rest for 15 minutes. Generously butter a large bowl or pot.
  
  Adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, knead the
  bread dough until smooth, about 5 minutes. (The gluten in rye is more
  fragile than in wheat. It needs a resting time to recuperate and
  reform and does not need as lengthy or vigorous a kneading). Form the
  dough into a smooth ball and place it in a buttered bowl, turning it
  to coat all sides with the butter. Cover it and let it rise in a warm
  spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
  
  Punch the dough down, gently knead it for one minute, and divide it
  into two parts.  Form each half into a round loaf and place the
  loaves in two lightly buttered 9-inch round cake pans or on a large,
  buttered baking sheet.  Press a hole through the center of each loaf
  to give it a traditional shape if you wish. Cover and let rise until
  almost doubled in size, about 1/2 hour.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  BRush the loaves with water and
  gently puncture the surface all over with the tines of a fork, in a
  design if you wish.
  
  Bake for about 30 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and
  sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. While it is hot, brush it
  with butter to glaze, and then let it cool on a rack.
  
  Yields 2 round loaves.

  3 1/2 c  Rye flour
      3 c  Warm water, flat beer
           Buttermilk or potato water
    1/4 c  Warm water (100-105o)
  3 1/2 c  Or 4c all purpose flour
      1    Egg lightly beaten with
      1 tb Water
      1 pk Dry yeast
      2 tb Salt
 
  four days ahead of bread making, prepare the starter: combine 1 cup
  rye flour with 1 cup liquid, cover loosely and set in a warm place.
  Stir once or twice each day, adding more liquid if the mixture
  becomes too dry. it should bubble and give off a strong odor.
  
  when ready to prepare the dough, put the starter in a large mixing
  bowl, add 2 more cups of whatever liquid was used and stir. Dissolve
  the yeast and salt in 1/4 cup warm water and stir in. Then beat in
  the remaining rye flour and up to 4 cups of the white flour one cup
  at a time to make a somewhat soft biscuit like dough firm enough to
  hold it's shape. It should not be too sticky. turn out on a lightly
  floured board and knead until smooth and velvety, about 10- 12
  minutes. Divide the dough into two equal parts and shape into balls.
  Place in two buttered bowls, turning to coat the dough with the
  butter.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
  about 1 1/2 hours. Place on a buttered baking sheet, cover and let
  rise again until doubled in bulk, about 40 minutes. Bake in a
  preheated 400o oven about 45 minutes or until the loaves sound hollow
  when tapped with the knuckles. Ten minutes before the loaves are
  done, brush the tops with the egg wash. cool, covered with towels to
  prevent the crust from hardening.

      Title: FIRE & ICE TOMATOES
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      6 md Tomatoes, quartered
      1 md Onion, sliced
      1 md Green pepper, cut in strips
    1/4 c  Water
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Celery salt
  1 1/2 ts Mustard seeds
      1 lg Cucumber, sliced
    3/4 c  Cider vinegar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/8 ts Black pepper
 
  In a large bowl combine tomatoes, onion, green pepper, and cucumber.
  In a small saucepan combine vinegar, water, sugar, celery salt,
  mustard seeds, salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper. Bring to a
  boil, boil 1 minute. Pour hot vinegar mixture over tomato mixture.
  Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight to blend flavors. Serve
  with slotted spoon.
  
  My note:  This is HOT.  Even Daryl said it was too hot! I think
  biting into those mustard seeds really gets ya. I'd cut the cayenne
  in half and probably the mustard seeds too. It's very pretty to look
  at, and was a nice tomato dish to have in the dead of winter. We
  served it with a fairly bland dish made from just some short grain
  brown rice and some peas, carrots, and corn thrown in at the end
  (frozen).

  2 1/2 lb Sugar-cured ham
      6 oz Dr. Schnitzel's hot sauce
      4 oz Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce
      1 lb Lentils
      1 lb Kidney Beans
      4 oz Tabasco Sauce
           Water
 
     Put the ham, lentils and beans in enough water to cover. Cook until
  beans are done.  Put in all hot sauces. Cook several more hours,
  until the flavor is all through the ham, which is thoroughly broken
  apart.
  
     Serve with something cold to drink.  It's great for your sinuses.
  I just threw this together because I was feeling reckless, but the
  taste was wonderful, and the stuff freezes well, too. Both Dr.
  Schnitzel's and the Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce are haba¤ero sauces,
  which I think accounts for the wonderful flavor (as well as the
  heat.) Tabasco alone would work, if you used a *lot*, but the flavor
  wouldn't be as good, I think.

      5 tb Louisiana hot sauce
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 tb White vinegar
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
 
  These screaming hot chicken wings are easy to prepare, and can be
  made hot, hotter and scorching hot by adding more hot sauce. Enjoy
  these wings with celery sticks and Cool Cucumber Dip to help
  extinguish any "fires." NOTE: The recipe actually calls for 3 to 5
  Tbsp of Louisiana hot sauce. Use your own discretion. Set oven to
  "broil" and place rack 6" from the element. In a medium sized mixing
  bowl combine hot sauce, oil, vinegar and garlic powder. Place chicken
  wings on a broiling pan. Using a pastry brush, coat the wings with
  the sauce mixture. Broil the wings for 7 minutes on one side before
  turning them over and broiling for another 7 minutes. You can also
  cook these wings over the BBQ. Cook wings for the same amount of time
  over medium high heat.  Be sure to preheat the BBQ and brush the
  grill with oil to prevent sticking. Serves 2 - 4

  Combine flour, salt & baking powder. With an electric mixer at
  medium-low speed, beat the butter & sugar until light & fluffy. Beat
  in egg & vanilla. Reduce speed to low, beat in flour mixture until
  just combined. Divide dough in half & shape each piece into a log
  about 1" in diameter. Cover with plastic wrap, & twist the ends of
  the wrap to force dough into a smooth cylinder. Refridgerate until
  almost firm (about 30 min). Spread about half the nuts on a work
  surface (a wide, 2" deep plastic container works well, and is
  re-sealable afterwards for storage). Roll one log in the nuts so that
  the entire surface is coated. Re-wrap & chill for at least 30 min.
  Repeat with the other log. Heat oven to 350~. Cut the chilled dough
  into slices about 3/8" thick. Put on ungreased baking sheets about 2"
  apart, & bake until edges start to brown, about 8-10 min.
  
  Options:  Replace Nuts with coloured sprinkles, or coloured sugar
  crystals. Or with the tiny coloured chocolate chips you can find in
  Bulk stores (very festive).  Or coconut, dyed or white. Use your

  Blue, mackerel, salmon, steelhead, trout, and other fatty fish except
  tuna.
  
  Caution: Eviscerate fish within 2 hours after they are caught. Keep
  cleaned fish on ice until ready to can.
  
  Note: Glass-like crystals of magnesium ammonium phosphate sometimes
  form in canned salmon. There is no way for the home canner to prevent
  these crystals from forming, but they usually dissolve when heated
  and are safe to eat.
  
  Procedure: Remove head, tail, fins, and scales. Wash and remove all
  blood. Split fish lengthwise, if desired. Cut cleaned fish into 3-1/2
  inch lengths. Fill pint jars, skin side next to glass, leaving 1-inch
  headspace. Add 1 teaspoon of salt per pint, if desired. Do not add
  liquids.
  
  Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or
  Table 2 according to the canning method used.

  TIME ESTIMATE: Hands on, 45 minutes COST ESTIMATE: Low
  
  Without a doubt, this is England's most famous dish. Always deep
  fried, the fish is mostly cod, and the batter made with eggs, milk
  and flour.Liberally salted, the fish and chips are traditionally
  doused with malt vinegar and wrapped in newspaper, so that everything
  goes limp. My recipe is designed not to flaunt tradition, but to make
  the taste available to those who count fat grams for good reason. My
  method delivers this "grease heaven" for a mere 13 grams of fat per
  serving...or 23 percents calories from fat. The peas are definitely
  not "classic" -t hey simply don't behave well in a newspaper...but
  then who does?
  
  Helpful Hints BIG CHIPS. The bigger the better! We experimented for
  some time with the idea that the larger the french fry the lower its
  fat content would be. It's simply a matter of exposed surface area.
  By cutting a large russet potato lengthwise into three slices both
  ways, you'll get nine potato sticks between 1/2" and 3/4". When they
  are cooked, you'll experience a completely new and fabulous taste -
  potato, almost free of grease. DIRECTIONS: THE CHIPS: Preheat the
  oven to 500F. In a large frying pan, heat the oil and fry the potato
  sticks until brown on all sides - about 13 minutes. Transfer the
  potatoes to a roaster pan and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven
  and sprinkle with the salt. THE FISH: In a small bowl, combine the
  cornmeal, bread crumbs, cayenne, salt, parsley and dill. Spread the
  mixture out on a large plate. Pour the milk, flour and oil out, each
  onto its own large plate. Set all 4 plates side by side.
   Dip the fillets first into the milk and then into the flour, turning
  until completely covered. Next dip the fish back into the milk, then
  into the bread crumb mixture and through the oil. Place the breaded
  cod on a baking sheet and bake for 8 minutes (you can time the fish
  to cook for the last 8 minutes with the chips.) THE PEAS: In a medium
  saucepan, bring the water to a boil and simmer the peas, salt, mint
  and sugar until the peas are tender - about 3 minutes. TO SERVE:
  Divide the fish and chips among 4 dinner plates. I serve this classic
  with a "handy" wedge of lemon (easy to squeeze), peas and watercress.
  It's the combination of golden browns and vivid greens and lemon
  yellow that makes such a great picture.

 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Eggs
           Splash of milk
      1 pk Golden Dipt Breading Mix
      4 c  Bread crumbs
           Garlic powder, salt and
           -pepper to taste
           Vegetable oil to fry
      4    Fillets of fish (perch,
           -walleye pike, etc)
 
  "Here's my quick and dirty recipe to cook fresh fillets...
  
  Soak your fish in a pan of milk first, overnight if you have time.
  
  Mix the eggs in a bowl with just a splash of milk. Mix in equal
  portions Golden Dipt Fish Style breading and 4 cups of bread crumbs.
  Note -- do NOT read the Golden Dipt box, mix it dry with the bread
  crumbs.
  
  Add garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste. For older men (Pat) use
  more garlic powder... this really does help (g).
  
  Put about 3/4 inch of oil in a frying pan and heat for about 10
  minutes on medium/high or until water sizzles when splashed in the
  grease (carefully).
  
  Take your fillets from the pan of milk and dip it in the egg/milk
  mixture. Then take it from there to the dry batter and make sure that
  the entire fillet gets a good coating. Place it in the pan of hot oil
  until golden brown. After you have repeated the process for all of
  the fillets, eat your heart out!!"

      1 c  Wine, white, dry
      6 c  Water, cold (approximately)
    1/4 ts Salt (or to taste)
      4    Clams
      8    Oysters, shucked
      1 oz Mung bean threads **
      8    Radicchio leaves
    1/4 ts Saffron threads
 
       ** Soak the mung bean threads (also called cellophane noodles)
  in hot water for twenty minutes. Drain, and cut into 2-inch lengths.
  Set aside.
  
       *** Split the carrots, celery and leeks lengthwise in half.
  Clean, peel, and slice the vegetables into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
  
       Melt the butter in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the
  onions, carrots, leeks, parsley, garlic, bay leaves and juniper
  berries, tossing the mixture well to coat with butter. When the
  vegetables begin to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium low and cover.
  Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
  
       Add the tomato to the stockpot and stir for 1 minute. Add the
  fish bones and trimmings and white wine. Cook this mixture for 5
  minutes, stirring occasionally. Add cold water to cover and raise
  heat to medium high.  Bring to a boil, skimming all of the froth from
  the surface as it forms.  Immediately lower heat and simmer gently,
  uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes.  Strain the mixture, pressing the
  solids firmly to extract all liquid.  Discard the solids. Add salt to
  taste.
  
       Heat 4 cups fish broth in a saucepan.  Steam clams separately in
  small amount of broth just until shells open, removing each shell as
  it opens. Transfer to 4 warm soup bowls; strain clam broth into warm
  fish broth, avoiding any grit at the bottom.
  
       Add oysters to fish broth and cook gently over low heat,
  uncovered, just until edges curl, about 1 minute. Place 2 oysters in
  each bowl. Ladle warm broth into bowls and add 2 tablespoons mung
  bean threads. Add radicchio leaves and saffron and serve.

      Title: FISH BROWN SAUCE
 Categories: Cajun, Sauces, Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      1    Whole bay leaf
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/4 ts Dried oregano leaves
    1/4 ts Dried thyme leaves
    1/8 ts Ground cayenne pepper

MMMMM----------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS---------------------------
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 tb All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Finely chopped onions
      4 ts Canned tomatoe sauce
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      2 c  Hot basic seafood stock
      2 tb Burgundy wine
      2 tb Unsalted butter, softened
 
  Serve this delicious sauce over broiled, fried or baked fish fillets
  or broiled, fried or baked oysters.
     Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set
  aside. Heat the oil in a heavy 1-quart saucepan over high heat just
  until the oil starts to smoke, about 1 to 2 minutes. With a metal
  whisk, mix in 2 tablespoons of the flour, whisking constantly and
  scraping pan bottom well, until the roux is dark red-brown to black,
  about 2 minutes, being careful not to let it scorch or splash on your
  skin. (Remove from heat momentarily if it is browing too fast for you
  to control, continuing to stir constantly.)  Immediately whisk in the
  onions; reduce heat to low and continue stirring and cooking about 1
  minute. Add the tomato sauce and stir and cook 1 minute.  Then stir
  in the seasoning mix and the Worcestershire (the mixture should now
  be thick and dark red-brown); cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring
  constantly.  Add the stock; turn heat to high and bring to a boil,
  stirring often.
   Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook about 6 to 8 minutes,
  stirring often.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of the burgundy and remove from
  heat. In a small bowl mix the butter and remaining 1 tablespoon flour
  until creamy. Return sauce to low heat; gradually add the butter
  mixture to the sauce, whisking until well blended each time. Return
  sauce to a simmer and simmer 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add the
  remaining 1 tablespoon burgundy. Remove from heat and discard bay
  leaf. Serve immediately. From Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen"

           -cut into 1/2 inch cubes
      6 oz Pork fat cut into 1/2 inch
           -cubes.

           -chopped
      2 c  Clam juice, fresh, canned
           -or bottled
      1 tb Fresh ground black pepper
      1 tb Marjoram
      1 tb Thyme
      1 tb Sage
    1/2 tb Rosemary, chopped fine.
      1 c  Dry white wine
      1 c  Fresh sweet corn or
     16 oz Unsalted canned corn,
           -strained
      1 lb Fresh fish, cut into 1
           -inch square pieces
     24    Fresh shelled chowder clams
           -or
      1 c  Strained canned clams
           -chopped up
      2 c  Light cream
 
  Use an enamel pot that holds about one gallon, add 2-3 ears sweet
  corn to boiling water. Cook until almost tender then cut corn off the
  cob. Add the potatoes to the same water and boil them until half
  done, about 5 minutes, strain and set aside.  On a medium heat, brown
  the pork fat until it's nearly crisp, remove the fattiest bits. Add
  the onion and when it's caramelized, add the garlic, celery and
  potatoes. Let each brown a little before the next is put in.  Add the
  butter if needed. On a low heat add 1 cup of clam juice, white wine,
  corn and all the spices. Simmer a few minutes to reduce slightly. Add
  the remaining clam juice, clams and fish, simmer another 5 minutes
  max. Salt lightly if necessary with course salt. Add light cream,
  when its starts to simmer its chow time! Serves 4
  
  If you want to make chowder without the clams then make a fish stock
  to substitute for the clam juice. Into one quart cold water add a 1/2
  cup of white wine, a small celery stalk, a few sprigs' parsley, a bay
  leaf, a pinch of thyme, 1/2 a small onion, a pinch of coarse salt, a
  few peppercorns and the head, tail and bones of any fish. Reduce it
  until you have about 2 cups (about 20 minutes) of stock. Strain
  liquid into a few bowls temporarily.

           Stephen Ceideburg
  1 1/2 lb Fish fillets *
      1 tb Fresh lime juice
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 ts Olive oil
      1 md Onion, thinly sliced
     45 oz Good-quality tomatoes,
           -lightly drained
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
     12    Meaty green olives, pitted
           -and coarsely chopped
      2 tb Large Spanish capers
      2 md Pickled jalapeno chilies,
           -sliced plus:
      1 tb Pickling juices
    3/4 ts Dried marjoram
    3/4 ts Dried thyme
      2 tb Finely chopped parsley **
      3    Bay leaves
      1    One-inch cinnamon stick
      2    Whole cloves
    1/4 ts Black peppercorns, cracked
           Fish broth, bottled clam
           -juice or water salt (opt)
 
  * like boneless and skinless red snapper or halibut, in 6 1 1/2-inch
  thick piece. ** plus a few sprigs for garnish
  
  Rinse fillets, place them in a non aluminum dish and sprinkle them
  with lime juice and salt. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. In a
  large nonstick skillet, heat oils over medium heat, add onions and
  cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 5 to 7 minutes.
  
  Cut tomatoes into 1 inch pieces and place them in a bowl, collecting
  the juices as you go.
  
  Add garlic to onion and cook for a minute or so, then add tomatoes.
  Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until most of the liquid has
  evaporated. Divide olives and capers between two small bowls and set
  one aside to use for garnishes. To the other bowl, add jalapenos,
  pickling juice, marjoram, thyme and chopped parsley. If you don't
  want bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves and pepper in the finished sauce,
  wrap them in cheesecloth and tie with a string, otherwise add them
  directly to the olive mixture.
  
  Add the olive-herb mixture to the tomatoes, along with fish stock,
  clam ice or water. Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, then taste,
  adding salt if necessary. Remove the cheesecloth bag, if using, and
  the bay leaves.
  
  Remove fillets from marinade and rinse. To cook on the stovetop,
  place them in the skillet, covering them well with sauce. Cover and
  cook over medium heat for 4 minutes. Turn the fillets over, cover and
  cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer, until they flake when pressed firmly
  with a fork at the thickest part.
  
  Alternatively, to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place the
  fillets in a single layer in a lightly oiled baking dish. Spoon the
  sauce over them, cover with aluminum foil and bake for 10 to 15
  minutes, or just until the fish flakes when pressed firmly with a
  fork at the thickest part. Serve garnished with reserved olives,
  capers and parsley.

      1 tb Tabasco sauce

      2    Fish steaks or
           -tournedos, cut about
           -1 inch thick)
 
  Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet, add onions, garlic, peppers,
  paprika and diced pecans. Cook over medium heat until onions are
  clear. Add Tabasco sauce.
  
  Turn heat to high, add sliced pecans and fish pieces cut about 1 inch
  thick. Cook on high 4-5 minutes per side. Smear uncooked side with
  sauce before turning. Add lemon juice and oregano after turning.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fish in a hot garlic/pecan sauce -- The Cajun Cafe in Portland
  Oregon serves a sauce whose recipe they got under license from
  K-Paul's in New Orleans.  They devoutly refused to answer all of my
  questions about the sauce or its ingredients, so I've tried to
  formulate it on my own, at home. This stuff doesn't taste exactly
  like what the restaurant serves, but it's delicious in its own right.
  Maybe it's best to title the recipe "fish with something not entirely
  unlike hot fanny sauce."
  
  This sauce is best served with a moderately strong fish: I would
  recommend sturgeon, swordfish, or tuna.
  
  *  If you are cooking more pieces of fish than will fit in the
  skillet at once, make the sauce ahead, put it aside (keep warm) and
  add it before cooking each piece of fish.
  
  *  Serve with a simple rice or pasta dish.  I use saffron rice with
  snow peas, or linguine with shrimp meat and pesto.

  lemon juice or vinegar at this time!)  Add the oil and turn the fish
  a couple of times. The fish should be nearly or completely submerged
  in the oil. For best results, the fish should be covered and
  refrigated overnight. You may also marinate it for a few hours.
  
  To cook, pat off the excess oil and lightly salt to taste. Grill,
  broil, or bake to your liking.  Do not over cook! Serve with lemon
  wedges. The leftover herbed oil can be refrigerated for a few day and
  reused only for fresh seafood preparation.

      Title: FISH PIE
 Categories: Main dish, Fish, British, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    700 g  White fish
      1    Shallot
      2 tb Dry white wine
      2    Eggs
    450 ml Milk
     30 g  Butter
     30 g  Flour
      4 tb Chopped parsley
    700 g  Mashing potatoes
    150 ml Hot milk
     60 g  Butter
           Salt & pepper
     50 g  Shrimps/prawns or
           Other shellfish AND/OR
     50 g  Mushrooms
 
  Wash the fish, which can be  a  mixture,  or  one single type, of cod,
  hake, haddock, smoked haddock etc etc. and dry more or less. Chop the
  shallot and put half of it into a buttered micro-wave dish. Put fish
  on top, and sprinkle with remaining  shallot, a little salt and
  pepper and the dry white wine. Cover loosely with cling film, pierced
  in two or three places and microwave on full power for about 5 mins,
  or until the fish is just cooked.
  
  Meanwhile, peel, quarter and boil  the  potatoes, hard boil the eggs,
  and make a white sauce with  the first lot of butter and milk, and
  the flour. (I use a little bit of maggi cube to make it into a
  bechamel ~ more or less. If using  mushrooms,  wipe  them, and cook
  lightly in a little extra butter. If using shrimps or prawns, cook
  them if needed, then shell them.
  
  As soon as the fish is cool  enough  to  handle, flake it into a bowl,
  taking care to remove any bones. Add the coarsely chopped hard boiled
  eggs, and such of the optional ingredients as you are using.
  
  Add the liquid exuded by the fish  during poaching to the white
  sauce, and cook down gently until the original volume is reached
  again. An alternative way of dealing with this liquid, is to cook it
  down to a near syrup, then add  it to the white sauce - it has the
  same effect, but needs a little more care. Taste carefully for
  seasoning, and then add chopped parsley. Gently fold fish flavoured
  parsley sauce into flaked fish and put the mixture into a pie dish of
  suitable capacity.
  
  When the potatoes are  done,  drain  them  and  mash. We use a potato
  ricer, which works very well. Add the second quantity of butter and
  the hot milk, stir briefly, season to taste and mix gently, taking
  care not to develop the gluten. Spread the  mashed  potato over the
  fish mixture, and if you like, make a bit of a pattern with a fork or
  knife.
  
  *May be cooked ahead to here
  
  If not required immediately, allow to cool uncovered, then cover and
  refrigerate until wanted.  Don't  keep for more then a day or so,
  especially if using shrimps/prawns. When required, remove from fridge
  and cook in pre-heated moderate oven  375øF 190øC until the mixture
  is bubbling and the top is  browned 25-40 mins depending on whether
  it was still warm when put into oven or had been refrigerated.

 Categories: Indonesian, Condiments
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4 oz Tuna fish, or:
      3 oz Eel or:
      3 oz Ikan teri
      1 c  Thick santen (coconut milk)
      4    Cloves garlic
      3    Shallots, peeled and chopped
      4    Kemiri (candlenuts)
      3    Cabe rawit or:
      2 ts Chilli powder
      2 tb Tamarind water or
      2 ts Tomato puree
      1 ts Brown sugar
           Salt
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  I find that the easiest and tastiest Sambal Ikan is made with canned
  tuna fish. Sambal made with eel, however, is also delicious; cut the
  eel up very small and wash it in vinegar. In Indonesia we make this
  sambal with ikan teri or ikan bilis (tiny dried anchovies). Pound the
  garlic, shallots, kemiri and cabe rawit into a paste. Fry this paste
  in vegetable oil in a wok for about half a minute. Put in the tuna
  fish, eel or teri; stir-fry for 1 minute and add the tamarind water,
  or tomato puree, sugar and salt. Stir in the santen, and go on
  simmering until the mixture becomes thick. This sambal can be served
  hot or cold.

      Title: FISH SAUCE
 Categories: Thai, Vietnamese, Condiments
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
           Information
 
  FISH SAUCE 1 The profusion of fish sauce can be a bit confusing. In
  general, the lighter colored ones seem to be better--more subtly
  flavored and less salty. I just found an excellent one the other day
  (at Safeway of all places) called "Shrimp Sauce". There's a picture
  of a shrimp on the label. The label is a bit confusing. The
  Vietnamese and English on the label call it fish sauce (nuoc mam) but
  the ingredients are listed as water, shrimp and salt. Unfortunately I
  can't read the Thai or Chinese on the label, but it has the symbol of
  "First Grade Quality" from the Thai Indus- trial Standard Institute.
  At any rate, it's good stuff. Here's a little discourse on fish sauce
  from "The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam" by Bach Ngo and Gloria
  Zimmerman.
  
  "Fish sauce is to Vietnamese cooking whet salt is to Western and soy
  sauce to Chinese cooking. It is included in practically all recipes.
  Prepared from fresh anchovies and salt, layered in huge wooden
  barrels, the manufacture of fish sauce is a major industry. The
  factories are located along the coast to assure the freshness of the
  fish to be processed. Fermentation is started once a year, during the
  fishing season. After about 3 months in the barrel, liquid drips from
  an open spigot, to be poured back into the top of the barrel. After
  about 6 months the fish sauce is produced.
  
  The first draining is the very best fish sauce, lighter in color and
  perfectly clear. It is relatively expensive and is reserved for table
  use. The second and third drainings yield a fish sauce of lower
  quality and lower cost fro general-purpose cooking. The two towns
  most noted for their fish sauce are Phi Quoc and Phan Thiet. Phu Quoc
  produces the best fish sauce, some of which is exported. On the
  label, the work "nhi" signifies the highest quality. When fish sauce
  manufactured in Vietnam is not available, that of Thailand or Hong
  Kong is quite acceptable. Philippine or Chinese fish sauce will not
  be satisfactory. For table use and available in all Oriental
  groceries is Squid Brand Fish Sauce, the best one on the market.
  Whatever the brand, look for "Ca Com" on the label, which means that
  only anchovies were used--an indication of the highest quality for
  table use."
  
  In the following post, another author presents more info, some a bit
  contradictory to the above.
  
  FISH SAUCE 2
  
  This is from "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Routhier.
  
  "...It enhances and blends so subtly with other flavors that one can
  barely detect its presence."
  
  "Like olive oil and good wine, there are different grades of fish
  sauce. The very best fish sauce is obtained from the first drainage.
  The resulting liquid is amber in color, very dark and usually
  expensive. If you see the words "nhi" or "thuong hang" on a label, it
  means that the fish sauce of of the highest quality. This type of
  fish sauce is usually reserved for table use. Sec- ond-grade nuoc
  mam, cheaper and intended for all-purpose cooking, is made by adding
  water and pressing the fish after the first- quality sauce has been
  extracted. The resulting liquid is light and very clear."
  
  "Fish sauce (nuoc mam): Nuoc mam is like Thai "nam pla" but
  stronger..."Squid" and "Ruang Tong" brands are widely available,
  bottled, in Oriental markets and some supermarkets..."
  
  So there it is. Ya pays yer money and yer takes yer chances... I
  doubt if you'll find any Vietnamese fish sauce, considering the
  embargo, but the Thai nuoc mam is supposed to be as good. In fact,
  I'll go out on a limb and say that, considering the fact that
  Thailand is just around the corner from Vietnam and has a lot of
  Vietnamese living there, that the differences would be undetectable.
  I'd get a bottle of light stuff and a bottle of the darker stuff
  (Tiparos brand comes to mind) and play around with them. At one time
  I had five different brands on the shelf. The stuff's pretty cheap
  and none of it was what I'd consider inferior.
  
  Now you know as much about fish sauce as I do...

      1    Fish Sauce Information
 
  Fish sauce is to Vietnamese cooking what salt is to Western and soy
  sauce to Chinese cooking.  It is included in practically all recipes.
  Prepared from fresh anchovies and salt, layered in huge wooden
  barrels, the manufacture of fish sauce is a major industry. The
  factories are located along the coast to assure the freshness of the
  fish to be processed. Fermentation is started once a year, during the
  fishing season. After about 3 months in the barrel, liquid drips from
  an open spigot, to be poured back into the top of the barrel.  After
  about 6 months the fish sauce is produced.
  
  The first draining is the very best fish sauce, lighter in color and
  perfectly clear.  [Kinda like "Extra Virgin" fish sauce. S.C.] It is
  relatively expensive and is reserved for table use. The second and
  third drainings yield a fish sauce of lower quality and lower cost
  for general- purpose cooking. The two towns most noted for their fish
  sauce are Phu Quoc and Phan Thiet.  Phu Quoc produces the best fish
  sauce, some of which is exported.  On the label, the "nhi" signifies
  the highest quality. When fish sauce manufactured in Vietnam is not
  available, that of Thailand or Hong Kong is quite acceptable.
  Philippine or Chinese fish sauce will not be satisfactory.  For table
  use and available in all Oriental groceries is Squid Brand Fish
  Sauce, the best one on the market. Whatever brand, look for the "Ca
  Com" on the label, which means that only anchovies were used++an
  indication of the highest quality for table use.

      1 lb Rockfish or lingcod filet
      1 tb Minced garlic
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Ground coriander seed

  Rinse the fish, pat dry and cut into pieces to fit comfortably inside
  each pepper. Combine minced garlic and salt in a medium bowl and mash
  to a paste with the back of a spoon.
  
  Add the lemon juice, coriander, pepper and 1 tablespoon olive oil and
  stir to combine. Bruise 3 or 4 of the basil leaves and add them to
  the marinade. Add the fish pieces, toss gently to coat evenly, and
  marinate for 1 to 2 hours.

  add it to the dry skillet.

  the sliced garlic and cook until it begins to color. Immediately add
  the tomatoes and pasta and toss to coat evenly. Add the basil leaves,
  remove from the heat, and season to taste.
  
  Spread the contents evenly on the plates and lay the peppers on top.
  As the fish pieces are done, tuck them inside the the peppers.

  and serve.

      Title: FISH TACOS INFO
 Categories: Seafood, Info, Mexican
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  I hadn't thought about it -- fish tacos might not be familiar to many
  people outside the So. Calif. area (not including people south of the
  US/Mexico border, where fish tacos are more common). Basically,
  "authentic" fish tacos are fish fillets that are batter dipped,
  deep-fried, and wrapped up in a warmed, soft corn tortilla with
  salsa, shredded cabbage, a mayonnaise based white sauce, and a wedge
  of lime. The story of their "discovery" goes something like this:
  
  During his college days, Ralph Rubio used to travel south of the
  US/Mexico border for a little fun 'n suds during Spring Break. He
  found fish tacos being served at taco stands in San Felipe, Baja
  California. Deciding they might be as popular north of the border as
  they were south, Rubio started experimenting with different batters
  and a deep-fat fryer in 1982. He opened his first walk up Mexican
  food outlet in San Diego in 1983. Rubio now owns a chain of Mexican
  food resturants that stretches all over the county and probably
  beyond. As evidence of the popularity of fish tacos, many San Diego
  area resturants now serve at least one version; and, they've gone
  beyond batter dipped deep-fried fish. They now include marinated
  grilled fish, shell fish, shark...

MMMMM--------------------------TO SERVE-------------------------------
           Spicy tomato sauce; and/or
           Tartar sauce to serve
 
  Drain the can of salmon and flake. Set aside.
  
  Put the flour into a bowl along with the seasoning and vegetable oil.
  Gradually beat in the milk or water until smooth and thick.
  
  Whisk the egg whites until they are stiff and fold these into the
  batter along with the salmon flakes. Heat the oil for frying in a
  deep fat fryer, over a moderate heat. Carefully drop tablespoons of
  the salmon batter into the hot oil. (It is better to cook the salmon
  fries 4-5 at a time depending on the size of your fryer. Keep the
  prepared ones warm in a low oven whilst cooking the rest.)
  
  Turn each salmon fry over after about 45 seconds to brown the other
  side. Use plenty of oil for frying as the batter will need to rise
  and move about the pan to cook properly. When golden brown all over,
  remove from the oil with a slated spoon and drain on absorbent
  kitchen paper. Serve the fries hot with tomato sauce or tartar.
  
  Serves 6-8. Approx. 220 kcals per serving

      Title: FISKEPUDDING ELLER FISKEFARSE (FISH PUDDING O
 Categories: Norwegian, Seafood, Main dish, Appetizers
      Yield: 60 Fish balls
 
      1 tb Butter; soft
      2 tb Bread crumbs; dry
  1 1/2 lb Cod or haddock; skinned and
           -boned
    1/2 c  Light cream and
      1 c  Heavy cream; combined
      2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
 
  "To make an authentic Norwegian fish pudding - white, delicate and
  sponging in consistency - you should begin with absolutely fresh
  white fish. The pudding is served weekly in Norwegian homes, usually
  hot, with melted butter or a shrimp sauce (see recipe). Cold and
  sliced, it is also excellent as part of an open-faced sandwich." With
  a pastry brush or paper towel, spread the bottom and side of a 1 1/2
  quart loaf pan or mold with 1 tablespoon of soft butter and sprinkle
  the mold with 2 tablespoons of dry bread crumbs. Make sure the crumbs
  are evenly distributed and tap out any excess. Cut the fish into
  small pieces and place a few pieces at a time in a blender, along
  with a couple of tablespoons of the combined creams to facilitate
  pureing. Blend at high speed, turning the machine off after the
  first few seconds to scrape down the sides of the jar with a spatula.
  Continue to blend, one batch at a time, until all of the fish is a
  smooth pure. As you proceed, use as much of the cream as you need to
  form this smooth pure. Place the pured fish in a large mixing bowl,
  beat in 2 teaspoons of salt and the 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch and
  slowly add any of the cream that was not used in the blender, beating
  vigorously until the mixture is very light and fluffy. Pour into the
  prepared mold and bang sharply on the counter to settle the pudding
  and eliminate any air pockets. Smooth the top with a spatula. Preheat
  oven to 350øF. Butter a sheet of tin foil and seal it tightly around
  the top of the mold. Place the mold in a baking pan and pour into the
  pan enough boiling water to come 3/4 of the way up the sides of the
  mold. Set the pan in the middle of the oven for 1 to 1 1/4 hours,
  regulating the heat if necessary so that the water simmers but does
  not boil; if it boils, the pudding will have holes. When the top of
  the pudding is firm to the touch and a toothpick or skewer in the
  middle comes out dry and clean, the pudding is done. Remove the mold
  from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Pour off all excess liquid
  in mold, run a sharp knife around the inside, place a heated platter
  on top and holding the mold and plate together, quickly invert the
  two to remove the pudding from the mold. Clear the place of any
  liquid with paper towels and serve the fiskepudding while still hot.
  TO MAKE FISH BALLS: Prepare the fish in the blender as described
  above. Chill the pured fish in the mixing bowl for about 30 minutes,
  then roll about 1 tablespoon of the fish in your hands at a time, to
  make 1" balls. Refrigerate them, covered with wax paper, until ready
  to cook. Poach these fiskefarse by dropping them into 3 or 4 inches
  of barely simmering salted water for 2 or 3 minites or until firm to
  the touch. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon, drain thoroughly and
  serve as part of a fish soup (see recipe). Makes 60 fish balls.

      2 tb Onion; finely chopped
      1 ts White vinegar
      3 tb Dill; fresh, finely chopped
      1 md Head lettuce; preferably
           -Boston
      2    Eggs; hard-cooked, sliced
      3    Tomatoes; peeled & cut in
           -wedges
 
  If you are using bottled, prepared horseradish, drain it through a
  fine sieve, pressing out the excess juices with a wooden spoon or
  squeeze it dry through a kitchen towel or double thickness of
  cheesecloth. In a large mixing bowl, combine the horseradish, sour
  cream, salt, pepper, onions, vinegar and 2 tablespoons of the chopped
  dill. Break the fish into 2" chunks and carefully fold it into the
  sour-cream dressing with a rubber spatula. Marinate for at least 30
  minutes in the refrigerator, then arrange the fish, sauce and all, on
  a bed of dried, chilled lettuce leaves. Garnish with the sliced eggs
  and tomato wedges and, just before serving, strew the remaining
  tablespoon of chopped dill over the salad.

    1/2 c  Onion, chopped
      3    Cloves garlic

    1/2 c  Rice
    1/2 ts Thyme
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper or pepper
           Flakes
      1 c  Crushed tomatos
           Pepper to taste
 
  Saute onions and garlic in 1/4 cup of broth until wilted. Add
  eggplant and pep per and mix.  Cook for about 5 minutes. Add the rest
  of the ingredients and cook c overed until the rice is done (stir
  occasionally). Remove the bay leaf.  This recipe really holds in the
  heat so let it cool in the pan for a while. Enjoy
  
  *Note:  Some types of rice require different water/rice ratios.
  Adjust the bro th and rice quantities accordingly. You may need to
  add a little more broth or water during the cooking process.  I think
  the eggplant soaks some of it up.

      Title: FIVE CHEESE PIZZA
 Categories: Pizza, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Whole wheat pizza dough (rec
           -ipe) or basic crust
      2 tb Pine nuts
      2 tb Olive oil; plus additional
           -for pan
           Cornmeal for pan (optional)
      1 ts White wine vinegar
    1/2 ts Garlic; minced
      1 sm Zucchini; thinly sliced (ab
           -out 3/4 cup)
    1/3 c  Red onion; very thinly slic
           -ed
    3/4 c  Provolone cheese; grated
           Coarse salt
           Fresh ground pepper
    1/2 c  Mozzarella cheese; grated
    1/3 c  Bel paese cheese; slivered
           -(get at italian groc.)
    1/4 c  Gorgonzola cheese; crumbled
      6 tb Parmesan; freshly grated (i
           -mported is best)
      1 tb Parsley; fresh, chopped
 
  1.  Prepare Whole Wheat Pizza Dough through Step 3. 2. Heat small
  skillet over low heat until hot to the touch. Add pine nuts; reduce
  heat to very low.  Toast pine nuts, shaking pan frequently, until
  evenly golden, about 2 minutes.  Set aside. 3. Heat oven to 500F. Oil
  a 12-inch pizza pan as necessary for type of pan (see below for
  tips); sprinkle with cornmeal if desired. 4. Combine 1 Tablespoon of
  the oil, the vinegar, and galric in medium bowl; add zucchini and red
  onion, tossing to coat. 5. Complete Whole Wheat Pizza Dough. 6. Place
  dough in prepared pan; brush surface with remaining oil. Sprinkle
  half the provolone evenly over dough, leaving a 3/4-inch border; top
  with even layer of zucchini mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to
  taste, then with the remaining provolone, all the mozzarella, Bel
  Paese, and Gorgonzola, and half the Parmesan. Sprinkle with
  additional salt and pepper.  Bake until crust is golden, about 15
  minutes. Scatter pine nuts evenly over surface. Bake until pine nuts
  and crust are browned, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Sprinkle with remaining
  Parmesan and the parsley.  Serve immediately. Makes One 12-inch
  Pizza! Recipe from Cuisine, November, 1984.  See Whole Wheat Pizza
  Dough recipe. Which Pan for Pizza? Almost any type of pan can give
  good results, though directions for brushing with oil and sprinkling
  with cornmeal differ slightly with each. In fact, the use of cornmeal
  is not required to prevent sticking except when using a pizza stone,
  but a little sprinkled on the surface of any pan will give added
  texture to the crust. Tin-lined steel; aluminum round pizza pans or
  baking sheets:
      Generously brush the pan with olive oil. Black-finished metal
  baking sheets and pizza pans:
      Follow the manufacturer's directions for care. Lightly brush
  bottom and sides (if any) with olive oil. Pyrex pizza pan:
      Generously brush pan with olive oil. Pizza Stone:
      Stones require preheating in a 500F oven.  They require no oiling
  but must be sprinkled with cornmeal to prevent sticking just before
  the pizza is transferred from the peel (paddle). The peel must also
  be sprinkled with cornmeal before the uncooked pizza is place on it
  for transfer to the heated pizza stone. When removing the hot pizza
  stone from the oven, be careful not to set it on a cold surface, or
  the stone will crack.

  Slice the bell peppers into strips and set aside. Wrap the tortillas
  in a thin, clean dishcloth, place them on an ovenproof plate, and put
  the plate in the oven. Warm the tortillas at the lowest setting on
  your oven while preparing the fajita mixture.  Heat the oil and water
  in a large saucepan over medium heat and add the chicken, bell
  peppers, and jalapeno peppers. Add the greater amount of jalapeno if
  you like your food very spicy. Saute, stirring frequently, until the
  chicken and vegetables are cooked through, about 25 minutes. Add salt
  to taste. Spread a spoonful of the fajita mixture in a thick line in
  the middle of each tortilla. Top with cilantro, tomato, and salsa to
  taste. Roll up the tortillas and serve. Makes 4 servings of 2 fajitas
  each.

  your own.  See Mexican-Style Hot Sauce recipe.

    200 g  Flour (1 3/4 cups)
      2    Eggs
    1/4 l  Milk (1 cup plus 1 Tbsp)
      1 pn Salt
           Fat for frying
 
  Mix the flour and milk, then add the eggs, and season with salt. In a
  skillet, melt a little fat over medium heat. As soon as the fat is
  hot, hold the skillet at a slight angle and pour in the batter in
  such a manner that the whole bottom of the skillet is covered with a
  thin layer. As soon as the bottom of the pancake develops yellow
  spots, carefully loosen the edges with an eggturner, then flip the
  pancake to cook the other side. Once the 'Flaedle' is done, set it
  aside for cooling.
  
  If the 'Flaedle' is to be used in 'Flaedle'-soup, roll it up and cut
  it into very thin slices.  Put into hot broth, and adjust seasoning
  to taste, with nutmeg, chopped parsley or chives, etc.

      Title: FLAESKEAEGGEKAGE (BACON & EGG CAKE)
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Bacon; preferably Danish
      6    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Milk
      3 tb Chives; finely cut
 
  Cut the long strips of bacon in half crosswise and then fry them over
  moderate heat in a heavy skillet. Do not let them get too crisp.
  Drain the strips on paper towels and set them on a ovenproof platter
  or baking dish and keep warm in a 200ø oven. Remove all but a
  tablespoon of the clear bacon fat from the skillet. In a mixing bowl,
  beat the flour and salt into the eggs only long enough to combine
  them and then slowly beat in the milk. Warm the fat in the skillet
  over moverate heat and pour in the egg mixture. Turn the heat down to
  low and, without stirring, let the eggs set into a firm custard.
  Since this will take about 20 minutes, an asbestos pad placed under
  the skillet will help to prevent the bottom of the egg cake from
  curning. Arrange the bacon slices and shives over the top of the
  finished cake. Serve directly from the pan as a first course, brunch
  or late supper dish.

      Title: FLAESKESTEG MED SVAER (ROAST HAM WITH CRACKLI
 Categories: Pork, Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/2    Fresh ham (butt or shank)
           -weighing about 6 lb. -=OR=-
      6 lb Shoulder of pork w/rind on
           Coarse salt or regular salt
           Fresh ground black pepper
 
  Preheat oven to 300øF. Using a sharp, heavy knife, cut deeply through
  the rind and fat until you reach the meat, making the incisions 1/2"
  apart lengthwise and crosswise. Rub salt and pepper liberally into
  these gashes. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the
  ham and place it on a rack set in a shallow roasting pan just large
  enough to hold the meat comfortably. Roast slowly 4 to 4 1/2 hours or
  until the meat thermometer reads 180øF. Do not baste the meat. When
  roasted, the meat should be moist and tender and the rind (or
  crackling) very crisp. Let the roast rest outside the oven for 10-15
  minutes for easier carving. A little of the crackling should be
  included in each serving of meat.

      Title: FLAGEOLET & GARLIC DIP
 Categories: Dips/spread, Appetizers, Vegan
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    175 g  Canned flageolets
      2 ts Ground cumin
      2 ts Coriander
      2 ts Turmeric
      1 lg Garlic clove; crushed
    1/2    Lemon; juiced
      3 tb Olive oil
           -or slightly more
           Salt
 
  The soft green colour of flageolets is highlighted by turmeric, and
  the rest of the spicing gives this dip a vaguely oriental feeling. It
  is rich, nourishing food best served with crudits and bread-sticks
  or pitta bread.
  
  Put the flageolets, spices, garlic and lemon juice into the blender
  and whizz to a thick pure with some of the juices from the can.
  Gradually stir the oil into the mixture to thin out to a dipping
  consistency. Season to taste.

           -- finely sliced
 
  This is a fantastic salad, prepared in no time at all, and at very
  little cost. Serve it with warm nan bread and one or two other
  interesting salads.
  
  Drain the flageolets and reserve a little of the liquid. Mix the
  pesto with 1 tbs of the liquid, adding more if necessary to bring to
  a mayonnaise consistency. Dress the flageolets in the pesto mixture,
  and fold in the mushrooms. Mix well. Leave to stand at room
  temperature for an hour or two before serving. Heap on to soft
  lettuce leaves lightly dressed with vinaigrette and serve.

  2 1/2 c  Instant flour ("Wondra")
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Unsalted butter,chilled>>>>>
           Cut into bits.
    1/2 c  Ice water, or as needed
      1 c  Cheddar cheese, fine grate
      1 ts Paprika (med-hot if avail.)
    3/4 ts Coarse (kosher or sea) salt
      2 tb Dry bread crumbs,fine
      1    Egg
      1 tb Water
 
  Whisk together the flour and 1 ts. salt thoroughly. Add the butter
  bits and, using your fingers or pastry blender, blend into flaky
  mixture. Sprinkle ice water gradually and mix lightly with a fork.
  Add just enough water to make the dough bits adhere to each other;
  don't overmix. Form dough into brick, wrap in plastic, and chill for
  at least 1 hr or as long as 12 hrs.
  
  When ready to bake the twists, halve the pastry, return one-half to
  'fridge, and roll remaining half on lightly floured surface to make
  rectangle 8 x 12". Turn pastry so that a long side faces you and
  brush off all surplus flour, then fold pastry like a book where the
  ends meet at the center.  Roll folded pastry out again, this time to
  an oblong 7 x 10". Stop at any point and refigerate dough if it
  becomes too soft. Dough MUST remain cold.
  
  Cover large baking sheet with wax paper and sprinkle lightly with
  flour. Lay pastry on paper and roll out to 9 x 12". Chill. Roll and
  fold second half of pastry. Chill both halves, uncovered, for 30 min.
  or cover loosely and chill up to 12 hrs.  Combine cheese, papprika,
  coarse salt, and bread crumbs in a bowl. Beat egg with 1 tbs. water
  in another bowl. Preheat oven to 400 F.
  
  Slide one sheet of dough, on its wax paper, onto the work surface.
  Brush lightly with egg mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of cheese
  mixture, pressing into surface. Cover with sheet of wax paper and
  turn dough over. Peel off wax paper from top, then coat surface with
  egg and another 1/4 of cheese mixture, pressing it in as before.
  
  Quarter sheet of dough (pastry wheel or pizza cutter), then cut each
  quarter into strips 1/2" wide and 4" long. Twist each strip to pencil
  thinness (they will lengthen as you twist) and place them 1/2" apart
  on ungreased baking sheet. Press ends of twists onto pan to prevent
  unrolling.
  
  Bake abt. 10 min., until the sticks are golden brown, then remove to
  racks to cool.  When cool, trim off any unsightly flattened ends.
  Repeat forming and baking proceedure for the second half of the
  dough. Store airtight for up to 2 wks in the 'fridge or 1 wk. at room
  temp. Baked twists may be frozen.  However stored, they improve with
  brief warming before serving. Yield:  5 dozen sticks

      2 tb Olive or vegetable oil
      1 lb White mushrooms; trimmed,
           - wiped, & finely chopped
           - (See NOTE)
    2/3 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      2 ts Dried chervil leaves
           - crumbled
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 lb All-butter puff pastry
           - defrosted according to
           - package directions
 
  IN A LARGE HEAVY SKILLET, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high
  heat until hot but not smoking. Add the onions and saute them until
  just limp, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining oil, then stir in
  the mushrooms. Adjust the heat to high and cook the mushrooms until
  the moisture has almost completely evaporated, 7 minutes, stirring
  often. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the cheese, chervil and
  pepper, and set the filling aside while rolling out the pastry.
  Lightly flour a clean workspace. Unfold the pastry and dust lightly
  with flour. Using a floured rolling pin, roll the pastry into a
  rectangle about 12-by-18 inches. Cut the rectangle into 2 long
  rectangles measuring 6-by-18 inches each. Brush off the excess flour,
  and spread half of the mushroom mixture over each rectangle, leaving
  a 1-inch border at the uppermost edges. Starting with the bottom long
  edge, roll up each rectangle jelly roll fashion gently pressing the
  top edge to seal the pastry. Carefully wrap the rolls tightly in
  plastic wrap or foil. Flatten each roll slightly by pushing gently on
  the sides so the spirals will be oval-shaped, and refrigerate until
  the pastry is firm, at least 2 hours. This may be done up to 4 days
  ahead of time. Preheat oven to 375F, and line a cookie sheet (or 2 if
  you have them) with baking parchment. Remove the rolls from the
  refrigerator as you are ready to cut them. With a sharp knife, cut
  the rolls crosswise into 3/8-inch slices. Place each oval onto the
  parchment, leaving 1 1/2 inches of space between them. Transfer the
  pan(s) to the middle of the oven, and bake until the tops are lightly
  browned. With a spatula, turn the spirals over and continue cooking
  until the second side is lightly browned and the centers are cooked
  through. If using 2 pans, rotate the pans during baking for even
  baking. Remove the pans, slide the swirls onto a rack to cool, and
  continue in the same fashion until all the swirls are baked. Serve
  warm. NOTE: If using your food processor to chop mushrooms, you will
  be far more successful if you pulse them several times to reach the
  desired consistency rather than let the machine run. Over-processed
  mushrooms are often watery and will not brown.

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking powder
     16 tb Cold unsalted butter -- (2
           Sticks)
      4 tb Cold water -- (4 to 6)
 
  To mix the dough by hand, combine flour, salt and baking powder in a
  mediumsized mixing bowl and stir well to mix. Cut butter into
  1tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to
  coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender,
  break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the
  dry ingredients. Keep the mixture uniform by occasionally reaching
  down to the bottom of the bowl and mixing all the ingredients evenly
  together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until
  the mixture resembles a coarseground cornmeal and no large pieces of
  butter remain visible. Sprinkle the minimum amount of water over the
  butter and flour mixture and stir gently with a fork the dough should
  begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly,
  add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time for the smaller
  quantity of dough, a tablespoon at a time for the larger quantity,
  until the dough holds together easily.To mix the dough in the food
  processor, combine flour, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted
  with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1second intervals to mix. Cut
  butter into 1 tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process,
  pulsing repeatedly at 1second intervals, until the mixture is fine
  and powdery, resembles a coarseground cornmeal and no large pieces of
  butter remain visible about 15 pulses in all. Scatter the minimum
  amount of water on the butter and flour mixture and pulse 5 or 6
  times the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still
  appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a
  time for the smaller quantity of dough,one tablespoon at a time for
  the larger quantity, until the dough holds together easily. Turn the
  dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form it into a disk (two
  equal disks for the larger amount of dough). Sandwich the disk(s) of
  dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press it into a 6inch
  circle. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to
  use it, at least 1 hour.

  Keywords: Breads, Vegetarian, Vegan, Lacto, Southwest
  
  If you haven't tried flame-toasted wheat tortillas you're in for a
  treat. Like toast they can be topped in endless ways.
  
  Place a tortilla directly over a medium high gas flame, or place on a
  cookie rack set over an electric burner. Toast until surface becomes
  lightly flecked with char, about 10 to 20 seconds, and tortilla
  begins to fill with steam.  Turn over and toast the other side. A
  perfect tortilla will fill with steam and puff up if it has no tears
  or holes.
  
  If desired, brush tortilla with oil or butter.  Place in a towel-lined
  basket while toasting the remaining pieces. Serve piping hot.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Rock Cornish Game Hens, defr
      4 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Sherry
    1/4 c  Brandy
 
     Remove giblets from defrosted birds and discard.
     Melt the butter in a heavy skillet with heat-proof handle. Season
  hens with salt and pepper, then brown lightly all over in the butter,
  turning frequently. This should take about 20 minutes. When hens are
  browned, add sherry to the pan and transfer it to the oven.
     Roast birds 45-60 minutes, until they are tender, basting often.
     Transfer hens to heated (and heatproof) serving dish. Warm brandy
  in a small saucepan and ignite it. Pour over the hens and serve
  flaming.

     If you cannot get Rock Cornish hens, use squab, poussin (very young
  chicken) or quail. These birds cook more quickly, so adjust the
  roasting time accordingly.

      Title: FLAN A LA ANTIGUA (TRADITIONAL CARAMEL CUSTAR
 Categories: Mexico, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Jim Vorheis
    3/4 c  Sugar
           The custard:
      1 qt Milk
      1 pn Of sea salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2    Inch cinnamon stick or
           -vanilla bean
           Small piece of orange or
           -lemon rind (optional)
      4    Eggs
      6    Egg yolks
 
  The caramel: Heat the sugar for the caramel in a small, heavy frying
  pan over low heat until it begins to dissolve. Shake the pan slightly
  (do not stir) until all the sugar has melted. Increase the flame and
  let the sugar bubble and color.  Pour the caramel into the mold and
  quickly turn it around in all directions, tipping it up in a circular
  motion until the surface - bottom and 2 inches up the sides - has
  been lightly coated with the caramel.  If the caramel thickens and
  becomes sluggish, gently heat the mold in a pan of hot water or over
  low heat, depending on the material, and continue the coating action.
  Set aside to cool.
  
  Put the milk, salt, sugar, and cinnamon or vanilla into a saucepan and
  bring slowly to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.
  Continue boiling slowly, taking care that it does not boil over,
  until the milk has reduced by about 2/3 cup.  Set aside to cool.
  
  Place an oven rack on the lowest rung of the oven and heat to 325 F.
  
  Beat the eggs and yolks together and stir into the tepid milk. Pour
  the mixture through a strainer into the flan mold and place it in a
  hot water bath in the oven. Test after 2 hours with a skewer or cake
  tester; if it comes out quite clean, the flan is cooked. Remove from
  the oven, but allow to sit in the water bath for about 15 minutes
  longer. Remove and set aside to cool completely before refrigerating.

MMMMM-------------------------EQUIPMENT------------------------------
      1    22 cm/9 in flan ring, about
           -- 4 cm/1 1/2 in deep
           Baking or dried beans
 
  The pastry case
  
  Roll out the pasry to a thickness of about 2-3 mm / 1/8 in. Grease
  the flan ring  and line it with the pastry, pulling the edges up
  gently with your fingertips to make a frill. Refrigerate for 20
  minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220 oC / 425 oF.
  
  Prick the bottom of the pastry case with a fork, line it with
  greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans and bake blind for 15-20
  minutes. Leave to cool slightly, then lift out the beans and remove
  the paper.
  
  With a pastry brush, brush all over the inside with the egg yolk -
  milk mixture, then return the case to the oven for about 5 minutes,
  until the glaze is lightly coloured. Leave in the flan ring and keep
  at room temperature.
  
  Reduce the oven temperature to 150 oC / 300 oF.
  
  The filling
  
  Put the eggs in a mixing bowl with about half the sugar and beat
  until pale and of a ribbon consistency.
  
  In a saucepan, bring the milk to the boil with the split vanilla pod,
  cinnamon stick and the rest of the sugar. As soon as it boils, pour
  it on to the egg mixture in the bowl, WHISKING CONTINUOUSLY. Scrape
  the seeds of the vanilla pod into the mixture, then discard the pod
  and cinnamon stick. Pass the custard through a sieve, pour into the
  pastry case and cook immediately for about 45 minutes, until the
  filling is just set. The top should be an attractive nutty brown.
  
  Serving
  
  When the flan is almost cold, lift off the ring, carefully slide the
  flan on to a serving plate and serve immediately at room temperature.

  :          flank steak -- *
  
  *This will do for a whole flank steak, but with just the two of us I
  use about 1/3 of a flank steak. This is so good that I serve it to
  company with my famousMarchand de Vin sauce. It is great because 1)
  there is no oil in the marinade and 2) flank steak is just about the
  lowest fat of beef around. I've tried the low sodium soy sauce,
  yukkkkkkk. So if sodium is a problem, you may have to skip this one.
  
  Mix marinade ingredients.  Marinade beef an hour or so at room temp,
  or overnight in the frig.  Turn occasionally or put in reclosable bag
  and press out air. Broil to your liking. Recipe By

      Title: FLANK STEAK MEPHISTO
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 1112 Servings
 
 
  3 tablespoon prepared dijon mustard 2 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
  1 tablespoon light soy sauce 1 minced clove garlic optional 1
  tablespoon whole coarsely cracked peppercorns optional
  
  Put steak on cutting board and make shallow diagonal cut with point of
  sharp knife. Continue making shallow cuts about 1/2 inch apart, then
  make cuts in opposite direction so surface of steak is scored in
  diamond crisscross pattern. TUrn steak over and repeat on opposite
  side. This cuts through surface fibers and keeps steak from curling
  as it cooks, and makes it easier to slice, too. Be careful not to cut
  too deeply.
  
  Spread both sides of steak with combination of mustard, worcester-
  hire sauce, soy and minced garlic, if desired. Spread peppercorns
  evenly over one side of steak, if desired.
  
  To crack peppercorns, put them in plastic bag and hit with hammer or
  other handy unbreakable object, just until peppercorns are very
  coarsely cracked, texture should be much coarser than commercially
  available cracked pepper.
  
  Broil, barbecue or pan fry steak, in nonstick skillet sprayed with
  cooking spray, peppercorn side down first, to desired doneness, about
  4-6 minutes each side depending on thickness.

 Categories: Garlic, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Flank Steak (1 piece)
      1 x  Salt & Pepper, To Taste
      2 tb Unsalted Butter
      2 tb Unsalted Butter, Softened

      1 x  Garlic Puree(1 head Roasted)
 
  Sprinkle flank steak with salt and a generous amount of freshly ground
  black pepper.  Heat a wide heavy skillet. Do not add fat. When hot,
  cook seasoned steak until seared and well browned on each side (about
  1 minute per side).  Reduce heat and add 2 T butter. Cook 3 to 5
  minutes on each side.  For best results, the meat should be quite
  rare. Remove the meat from the pan and keep warm.  Pour off the fat
  in the skillet and add the scallions and red wine.  Bring to a boil
  and whisk in the garlic puree. Boil until the wine is reduced by
  half, thickened, and syrupy. As it boils, scrape up the browned bits
  in the skillet with a wooden spoon. Stir in the meat juices that have
  accumulated unter the flank steak. Boil for 1 or 2 seconds more.
  Remove from the heat.  Gently swirl in the 2 T soften butter so that
  it incorporates into the wine. Quickly slice the meat, against the
  grain, into thin strips. Arrange the slices on a hot platter, pour
  sauce down the center of them and serve at once.

      Title: FLANK STEAK WITH PEPPERS STIR FRY
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Flank steak
      3 tb Soy sauce; reduced sodium
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      4 ts Cornstarch
      1    Bell pepper; red or green
      1    Onion; medium sized
      2    Celery; stalks
    1/2 c  Beef broth
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      5    Fresh ginger; slices 1/4"thk
 
  Cut the steak with the grain into 2" wide strips, then cut each strip
  across the grain into 1/4" slices. (You will find the meat is easier
  to slice if you place it in the freezer for a short while before
  slicing) In a medium bowl, combine the steak with the soy sauce, 1
  tb. of the oil and 2 ts. of the cornstarch.  Stir to coat the steak
  and set aside. Cut the pepper into thin slivers. Cut the onion into
  1/2" thick wedges.
   Cut the celery on the diagonal into 1/2" slices.  In a small bowl,
  stir together the broth, black pepper and the remaining 2 ts.
  cornstarch and set aside. In a large skillet or wok, warm 1 tb of the
  oil over med. high heat. When the oil is very hot, but not smoking,
  add the beef and the marinade and stir-fry until the beef is browned,
  but still slightly pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes.  Transfer the
  beef to a plate and set aside. Add the remaining 1 tb. of oil to the
  skillet. Add the pepper, onion, celery and ginger, and stir-fry until
  the onions begin to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the beef to the
  skillet.  Stir the broth mixture, add it to the skillet and bring the
  liquid to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, until the vegetables are
  crisp-tender and the beef is cooked through 2 to 3 minutes longer.
  Serve hot with steamed rice. Do-Ahead Time savers: All of the
  vegetables can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated, covered
  until ready to cook. The broth mixture can be made well ahead and the
  beef can be mixed with its marinade several hours ahead...in fact, I
  think it is better when marinated for a time before the actual
  cooking. Calories: 348 Protein: 23 gm Fat: 25 gm Carbo: 7 gm
  Cholesterol: 59 gm Sodium: 653 gm. When I cook, I have made it a
  habit to gather the ingredients, measure them and set them aside,
  ready for the time when they are needed. You will find that this is
  one of the secrets of preparing good Oriental dishes, as they usually
  contain many ingredients, lots of chopping, and are cooked rather
  quickly. Barb

  With an adult's help, preheat oven to temperature specified on
  package.
  
  Sprinkle flour on a clean, flat surface and roll out cookie dough
  slightly thicker than what the package calls for. then, using butter
  knife, cut out cookies in the shape of a flattened cat. Use a large
  spatula to carefully transfer cookies to cookie shee
  
  Bake according to package directions. While they're cooling, count out
  enough cinnamon candies to put two eyes and a nose on each cat.
  Carefully flatten between the front and bakdof two spoons and set
  aside.
  
  Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for about 3 minutes and
  then press in eyes and nose. Transfer to wire rack to continue
  cooling. Dribble jam here and there on each cookie for blood. Makes
  approximately 3 dozen kitty road kill (HEY BODLE!!!!!)
  
  Sicko serving suggestion: Instead of making each cookie in a perfect
  cat shape, make a few that are missing a limb and/or tail. Why not
  even sever a head or two? Drip jam blood at stumps for an
  authentically dismembered look?

  until it is well distributed.  Refrigerate the dough for 15 to 20
  minutes before stretching or rolling it out or let it go through
  another rising before shaping it.
  
  Note: Sometime flavored doughs become sticky after the additional
  ingredients have been kneaded in.  If this happens, simply knead in a
  small amount of flour until the dough is smooth and no longer sticks."

      2 tb Melted Margarine Or Butter
      3 tb Strawberry Flavor Drink Mix
      2 tb Instant Cappuccino Flavoring
      1 tb Dry Blue Cheese Dip Mix With
           A Dash Of Garlic Salt
      1 ts Curry Powder With:
      1 ts Cumin And:
    1/2 ts Garlic Salt
      2 tb Chili Seasoning Mix
           Tabasco Sauce To Taste:
           Added To Melted Butter
 
  Using 1 quart of freshly made popcorn as a serving size; select one
  of the listed flavor combinations and follow directions. In most
  cases adding the flavor to the melted butter or margarine would be
  the easiest method. The strawberry flavored drink mix will give
  strawberry flavored popcorn. The instant Cappuccino mix will give
  Cappuccino flavor. The dry Blue Cheese and garlic salt will give Blue
  Cheese flavor.  The combination of curry powder, cumin and garlic
  salt is good for curry. Chili seasoning will give a south of the
  border flavor and finally adding Tabasco sauce to your taste to the
  melted butter will give that added kick some may prefer.

      1    Sprig fresh herbs
           Peppercorns
           Fresh chilies
      1    Clove garlic

           Cider
           Champagne
           Sherry -- or
           Rice-wine vinegar
 
  Vinegars keep for up to a year. Use good-quality red-wine or
  white-wine vinegar or cider, sherry, champagne or rice-wine vinegar.
  For vinegar containers, I like to recycle attractive bottles. They
  must be in excellent condition, free of chips and cracks.
  
  Sterilize the bottles before using: Wash with hot soapy water and
  rinse well. Place on a wire rack in a large pot and add water to
  cover the bottles; bring to a boil and let boil for 15 minutes.
  
  Transfer the bottles to a clean towel, then use a chopstick or skewer
  to poke desired flavorings into sterilized bottles. Experiment with
  different combinations and amounts.  Addvinegar to fill, using a
  funnel. Seal tightly with clean new corks, plastic stoppers or
  screw-on tops. Store in a cool, dry place for at least a week to
  allow flavors to blend.Store at room temperature.

 Categories: Spice/herb, Info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
MMMMM-----------------------NO INGREDIENTS----------------------------
 
  Second Part: Flavoring oils and vinegars.
  
  Class from Cook's of Crocus Hill class in the fall of 1993.
  
  OILS; Garlic in oil at room temperature is dangerous.
  
  Put herbs in jar-press down-Pour oil over all. Olive oil or canola
  oil. A mixture is nice. Cover and put in the fridg for 7 to 10 days.
  Take out and let warm to room temperature if the oil is hard. Strain
  and put back in the fridg. I have frozen oil with sucess.
  
  Put lemon flavors together.
  
  Put the other flavors together (this also applies to the flavored
  vinegars.)
  
  Mixes; 1. Italian parsley, thyme, garlic and oregano. 2. Rosemary and
  thyme 3. lemon mix-with garlic
  
  Canola shouldn't emulsify in the fridg.
  
  These are good with stirfry, salads, and drizzled over toasted french
  bread.
  
  VINEGARS;
  
  You can let these set out virtually forever.
  
  Use only apple-cider vinegar-it comes only in quart size jars. The
  other is flavored and tastes funny.
  
  You can also use wine vinegar.
  
  Stuff the bottle half full with herbs, then fill with vinegar.
  
  Good Mixes; 1. Lovage, tarragon, garlic and chives. 2. Lemon
  basil-opal-different variaeties. 3. Marjoram is nice in vinegar.

           -vinegar
      4    Or 5 shallots, peeled and
           -slightly crushed, threaded
           -on fine string or
      4    Cloves garlic, peeled and
           -slightly crushed or
      2 tb Mustard seed or

           -bottle
 
  Flavoured wine vinegar has been an important ingredient in French
  cooking since medieval times when vinegar was essential in order to
  keep meat edible in warm weather.
  
  In the 13th century, street vendors were granted the right to cry
  their wares in the thoroughfares of Paris. These cries soon became
  famous, and the vinegar sellers even rolled their casks through the
  narrow streets crying 'Garlic and mustard vinegars, herb vinegar... '
  
  'Vinaigres, bons et biaux.'
  
  They also sold verjus, the sieved juice of unripe grapes which serves
  to sharpen the flavour of many cooked dishes in the same way that
  vinegar does.  It is still used in some country places and provides a
  means of using up green grapes unfit for any other purpose.
  
  All farm kitchens have an earthenware vinegar barrel. It constitutes
  another of the many country economies. After the grape harvest, a
  certain quantity of either red or white wine is reserved and poured
  into the barrel over a liquid fungus or mere de vinaigre which turns
  it into vinegar. The quantity drawn off each day is replaced by
  emptying the remains of the wine bottles into the barrel.
  
  When herbs are most pungent, just before flowering, they are cut and
  used to aromatize some of the vinegar drawn off. It is then bottled
  and used for flavouring.
  
  Owning a vinegar barrel is a privilege of which few English kitchens
  can boast but plain wine vinegar sold in the multiple chemists' shops
  can be used effectively with home-grown herbs to produce fine vinegar
  at much less cost than that prepared commercially.
  
  FLAVOURED VINEGAR:
  
  Collect the number of bottles necessary, with sound corks to fit.
  Wash the bottles in hot soapy water, rinse first in very hot water
  then in cold, drain, dry and heat in a slow oven. Scald the corks in
  boiling water.
  
  Pour the vinegar into an enamel-lined or stainless steel pan and over
  a low temperature bring slowly to blood heat. It should be quite warm
  to the touch of a knuckle joint, no more. Add shallots, garlic,
  mustard seed or tarragon to the warm bottles.  (If using tarragon,
  this should be bent double and pushed down the neck of the bottle.)
  Fill up with warm vinegar, cork down tightly, and place on a sunny
  window sill to mature for 6 weeks before use.

MMMMM-------------------------BASIC RIBS------------------------------
      3 lb Country Ribs or other
      1 c  Cider Vinegar
      2 tb Black Pepper fine ground
      2 tb Garlic Salt

MMMMM--------------------SAUCE FOR RE-HEATING-------------------------
      1    Open Pit small bottle
      1    Small Bottle A-1 Sauce
    1/4 c  Molasses
      1    Supply of Hickory Chips
 
  Regular old supermarket pork. Spare ribs, country ribs, or any other
  pork Not too much fat. Cut off any gross excess, and cut them to EVEN
  thickness. You'll ruin everything if you cook the meat unevenly. You
  may compensate by scoring the meat. In a large baking pan, soak the
  ribs with cider vinegar, after which sprinkle them with garlic salt
  and finely ground black pepper. (Don't use pepper mills, or other
  peppers.) It doesn't seem to matter how long the ribs soak, or how
  much vinegar is on them. Just make sure it hits all sides, you don't
  have to puncture them. This sweetens the meat. The key to the fire is
  the hickory chips. Keep feeding these amazing little fellows to the
  charcoal. The flavor comes out of these chips and you cannot do
  without them. Make sure the fat and chips don't light up your whole
  dinner and ruin it.
  
  Cooking: A moderate hot fire a couple of inches or more from the
  meat, and a grill of reasonable cleanness. As the meat cooks turn it
  often, do not let it burn, do not baste it with anything. Don't cover
  the grill and don't stray too far -- fire is always hiding in the
  wings. Here is the catch -- the trick -- the hard part, is the
  timing. You may ruin some meals before you hit it, but the time to
  take them off the grill is one minute after trichina danger is past.
  As soon as the meat turns brown it's time to eat. You can use the
  small strips you cut off to judge just when things are perfect.
  
  Special Purpose Sauce: (don't eat it cold, it's awful) 1 bottle Open
  Pit, One bottle A-1 Sauce, 1/4 C of molasses. Start re-heating the
  sauce until slow boil, dump in the cold pork from the fridge. alt.
  without sauce wrap the meat in foil and heat at 325 oven for 15-20
  minutes. Sauce can be stored and re-used, but remember it will have
  pork fat in it now.

           Finely chopped
    1/2 c  Granulated Sugar
    1/2 c  Light Brown Sugar -- packed
      1 tb Light Corn Syrup
      2 lg Eggs -- at room temperature
      2 ts Vanilla Extract
    1/2 c  Fresh Raspberries -- at room
           Temperature
           White Chocolate Raspberry
           Topping---
      2 oz Unsalted Butter -- cut into
           Pieces
      6 oz White Chocolate -- chopped
           Fine
    1/2 c  Fresh Red Raspberries -- at
           Room temperature
 
  1. Brownie:  Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and
  preheat to 325 F.  Line an 8-inch square baking pan with a double
  thickness of aluminum foil so that the foil extends 2 inches beyond
  two of the opposite ends of the pan.  Fold the overhang down to form
  "handles. " Butter the bottom of the foil-lined pan. Sift flour,
  baking soda, and salt through a wire strainer onto a sheet of wax
  paper.
  
  2. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Off heat, add
  chocolate and let stand 1 minute; whisk until smooth. Pour into a
  large bowl, and let stand 5 minutes, until tepid. Whisk in sugars and
  corn syrup. Whisk in eggs, then vanilla.  Using a wooden spoon, stir
  in flour mixture, just until blended.  Using a rubber spatula,
  carefully fold in raspberries.
  
  3. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan and bake 25 to 30 minutes,
  until a toothpick inserted 1 inch from the edge of the brownie comes
  out with a moist crumb. Cool on a wire cake rack for 10 minutes.
  Invert onto the wire cake rack, carefully peel off aluminum foil, and
  cool completely.
  
  4. White Chocolate Raspberry Topping:  In the top part of a double
  boiler, over hot, not simmering, water, melt butter. (Water should be
  no warmer than 125 F. ) Add white chocolate and melt, stirring often
  until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl, and let stand 10 minutes,
  until tepid and slightly thickened.  Using a metal cake spatula,
  spread half of the topping onto the top of the brownie. Freeze
  brownie for 5 minutes, just until topping is partially set. Using a
  sharp knife, mark topping of brownie into 16 squares.  Using a rubber
  spatula, carefully fold remaining 1/2 cup raspberries into remaining
  topping.  Divide white chocolate-coated raspberries evenly among
  brownies, arranging them attractively on top of each square. Loosely
  cover brownies with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to
  set topping completely. Using a sharp knife, cut through markings
  into 16 squares. Transfer brownies to a serving plate and cover
  tightly with plastic wrap.  Brownies can be made up to 1 day ahead,
  refrigerated, and covered with plastic wrap. Bring to room
  temperature before serving

      Title: FLORENCE ITALY RESTAURANTS
 Categories: Digest, Mar95, Text
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Text recipe
 
  Here are my favorite places in Florence, city of (imho) great food:
  
  Trattoria Le Mossacce on via del Pronconsolo, 55r (where "r" stands
  for the red numbers on the bldgs...as opposed to the black numbers.)
  This place is GREAT!  It's almost like an Italian diner in that you
  can watch the guys cooking your meal.  If you know Italian, you won't
  even need a menu; the guys just come over and tell you what's
  cooking. There's a jug of wine on every table.  You just tell the guy
  at the cash register what you had as you leave.
  
  Trattoria da Benvenuto (via dei Neri, 47r)  I had their gnocchi with
  tomato/eggplant sauce and was in heaven!
  
  There's also a neat market near the open-air San Lorenzo Market. It's
  a gorgeous old wrought-iron building with lots of veggies for sale on
  the 2nd floor. And here are 2 restaurants I've never been to, but
  wanted to:
  
  Trattoria Coco Lezzone (via del Parioncino, 26r, off via Parione) It
  always looked wonderful and was highly recommended by locals, as well
  as by Let's Go.  A friend of mine went there and raved about it.
  Let's Go says to get their pasta porcini fresca. (How can you go
  wrong with porcini mushrooms?)
  
  Stazione da Zima (via Ghibbelina 70r)  Let's Go says: "No Sign.
  Healthy food for herbivores.  First course choices (L4500) include
  house specialties like riso integrale (brown rice) and pasta al
  pesto. Stuffed tomatoes provide a satisfying secondo (L5500). They've
  also got a great crunchy bulletin board with notices of environmental
  activities. [Which reminds me, I've never been to Florence and not
  seen students marching in the streets about something. --cb]
  
  And here are a few recommendations for Venice, city of relatively bad
  food. The write-ups are from Let's Go, 1993/4:
  
  In the Castello part, I liked one of these two restaurants a lot. (I
  didn't mark which one in my book. It's one of those, "I'd recognize
  it if I were there" things...pretty sure it's the first one. Another
  way to find it is to ask where the gondolier's eat.)
  
  Trattoria Alla Rivetta, Castello, 9625 (tel 528 73 02). Off campo SS.
  Filippo e Giacomo which lies just east of p. San Marco -- the
  restaurant's squeezed in to the right before the Ponte San Provolo.
  One of the only genuine and reasonable places in the area. Open
  Tues./Sun. 11am-11pm
  
  Trattoria Chinellato, Castello, 4227 (tel 523 60 25, on calle
  Albanesi a few doors down from campo SS. Filippo e Giacomo.
  Gregarious proprietor will make you feel right at home. Get your
  salivary glands going by peeking through the window first. Open
  Wed-Mon., 9-9.
  
  Found this one, but the proprietor was in a bad mood and didn't seem
  to be seating tourists for some reason...but it sure smelled good in
  there! I'd try it again if I went back. Osteria Al Mascaron,
  Castello, 5225 (tel 259 95) on calle longa Santa Maria Formosa, which
  runs off campo Santa Maria Formosa, northeast of p. San Marco. The
  ultimate in informal osteria eating.  Filled with chattering
  Venetians taking a wine break or enjoying delicious specialties...
  Open mid-Jan to mid-Dec., Mon.-Sat. 10:30am-3pm and 7-10:30pm.
  
  In the Dorsoduro part: Da Silvio, Dorsoduro, 3748 (tel. 520 58 33), on
  calle S. Pantalon near the campo of the same name. Delicious fare
  served up in the trattoria's garden...Pasta from L3500. Open
  Mon.-Sat. 9-3:30 and 5:45-11
  
  Also in Dorsoduro, but didn't get to go in.  They were closed each
  time I was in the area: Crepizza, Dorsoduro 3757 (tel. 522 91 89), on
  calle San Pantalon off calle Crosera across from da Silvio. Look for
  the hanging sign.  Crepes and pizza served with zeal. Open Wed.-Mon.
  noon-2:30pm and 7-10:30pm.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      4 lb Yellow onions, cut in half
           -lengthwise thinly sliced
      2 ts Sugar
           Salt
    750 ml White wine
      4 c  Chicken broth
      1    Cinnamon stick
      4 c  Stale Italian or French
           -bread, torn
           Parmesan cheese, grated
 
  In a Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onions
  and toss to coat with the oil. Cover tightly, reduce the heat to
  medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are
  soft an just beginning to color (30 minutes).
  
  Remove the cover, increase the heat to medium, and cook, stirring
  occasionally, until the onions are amber (45 minutes). Sprinkle with
  sugar and a little salt. Cook, stirring frequently until the sugar
  melts and the onions are caramelized (5 more minutes). Add the wine,
  broth, and cinnamon stick. Stir well, and bring to boil. Cover
  tightly, reduce heat to low and simmer gently for one hour, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Add the bread to the simmering soup and continue cooking until the
  bread disintegrates, 30 to 45 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent
  the soup from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Discard the cinnamon
  stick. Using a wire whisk, whip the soup until the bread is well
  incorporated. Taste and add more salt if needed. Garnish with
  Parmesan. From the cafe creosote web page.

      Title: FLORENTINE RAVIOLI FILLING
 Categories: Pasta, Cheese, Italian
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     16 oz Ricotta, skim milk
      2    Eggs
      6 oz Mozzarella; shredded
      3 tb Parsley, fresh; chopped
      2    Garlic clove; chopped
    1/2 pk Spinach, frozen chopped;
           -thawed & drained
      4 oz Parmesan or Romano; grated
 
  In a large mixing bowl beat the ricotta and eggs until fluffy and well
  combined. Add the parsley, garlic and spinach and mix together with a
  spoon.  Stir in the shredded cheese and stuff into prepared ravioli
  pasta. This is also a wonderful filling for manicotti, large pasta
  shells, and as the cheese filling for a truly sinful lasgna.  I
  almost forgot, I add a healthy dose of fresh cracked pepper.
  
  BTW, be sure you drain and squeeze as much water as possible out of
  the spinach or the filling will be very runny.
  
  If you want to try the wonton wrappers place a tablespoon or so of
  filling in the middle of one wrapper, cover with another wrapper
  being careful to press all of the air out as you seal the two
  together. You can get a good seal if you brush the edges with a
  little water first. If you don't press out the air the ravioli tend
  to burst when you boil them. Drop a few at a time into rapidly
  boiling water and remove when they float to the top. Serve with your
  favorite sauce (nice with marinara or alfredo). You might try a dash
  of nutmeg in the filling as a variation, seems to me it would be very
  nice with the cheese and spinach.

  2 1/2 lb Fresh spinach; (or 3

      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Olive oil

      3 tb Flour
      1 c  Milk; (warmed)
           -salt
           -and pepper to taste
 
  I did some research on Florentine, and decided there is no one recipe
  to follow, so I`ll give you my version. The florentine part of tne
  recipe is basically a bed of spinach. The meat is varied, such as
  fried fish, veal cutlets, sliced steak. pork cutlets, chicken
  cutlets. Use your imagination.
  
  Wash and cook the spinach in a small amount of water. Drain well
  (squeeze with hands when cool enough), chop coarsely. In a large pan
  melt butter in olive oil and when hot add spinach and fry lightly.
  Season with salt, pepper, + nutmeg. Sprinkle in the flour, add the
  warm milk and stir. Simmer for a few minutes. Transfer to a baking
  dish and keep warm in oven. Prepare meat or fish. When ready top the
  spinach with the meat and serve hot.

  Dissolve the gelatin in 2 tablespoons hot water in a cup; place the
  cup in a bowl of very hot water so the gelatin melts. Check
  occasionally to make sure the surrounding water stays hot. (I suppose
  you could use a microwave for this, but I've never tried.)
  
  Divide the cream into two very cold bowls.  Whip each until stiff; if
  the flavoring for either half isn't sweet, add powdered sugar to
  taste at this point. Beat the dissolved gelatin into the cream.
  Flavor each half separately.  Spread one half around the inside of
  the cake-lined bowl; fill with the other half.
  
  Top with more cake and douse with more spirits.  Since this part
  doesn't show you don't need to be creative. Cover with plastic wrap
  and chill overnight.
  
  Turn out onto a platter and garnish with chopped nuts, grated
  chocolate, or powdered sugar if desired.  Cut into wedges; serves
  about 10-20 people depending.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Ladyfingers with cream and rum -- This makes a great dessert for a
  party. It only takes about an hour to make (more if you bake a cake
  yourself instead of buying one) and only requires a few seconds to get
  ready when served. Yield: Serves 10-20.
  
  *  The most recent zuccotto I made used rum to flavor the lady
  fingers. The first filling had powdered sugar, vanilla extract and
  about 1 1/2 oz chopped semi-sweet chocolate. The second had about 5
  oz melted semi-sweet chocolate mixed with about 2 t instant coffee
  dissolved in a little boiling water, and another 1 1/2 oz chopped
  semi-sweet chocolate. (Just chop 3 of the squares of chocolate and
  melt the other 5). Chopped hazelnuts or almonds are also quite good.
  
  *  You can make a smaller one by using less, of course!

      Title: FLOUR TORTILLAS (COLEEN)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking powder
      4 tb Butter, cut into pieces
    1/2 c  Warm water
 
  Mix the top four ingredients as for a pie crust. The butter must be
  worked into the flour to make a pebbly meal. Slowly add the water,
  mixing only enough to make it all stick; the dough should be soft,
  not at all stiff so add enough water. DO NOT KNEAD. You want to treat
  this like a pie crust, else the tortillas will be tough.
  
  Roll the dough lightly into a "log" and cut it into 12 equal pieces.
  Roll the pieces lightly in flour to keep them from sticking together.
  Cover with plastic while you prepare the fajitas. The tortillas need
  time to rest before you roll them or they won't stretch enough. When
  the dough has relaxed (at least 15 minutes later) start heating a
  cast iron skillet. The skillet needs to be medium-hot to hot (but not
  as hot as for corn tortillas). On a well-flowered surface, roll each
  little ball of dough, flipping it and turning it to form a perfect
  round, thin tortillas. It will take practice before you get this
  right and learn what is too thin or too thick. I usually roll my
  tortillas until they are about 6-7 inches in diameter.
  
  After each tortillas is rolled, you must keep them moist by layering
  them between plastic (I use plastic supermarket produce bags) or
  layers of wax paper. When all tortillas are made, you can start
  baking them in the iron skillet. Place one tortilla at a time in the
  skillet and flip with a thin metal spatula. You want little air
  pockets to form and pressing lightly on the tortillas with the back
  of the spatula as it cooks will encourage steam to form and the
  tortilla to "balloon". Cook only until there are light brown patches
  on both sides. Place each tortilla in a towel lined basket and cover
  with another towel. This will steam the tortillas.
  
  Enjoy tortillas (both kinds) plain, buttered, or stuffed with an
  almost infinite variety of fillings. Nothing beats homemade tortillas!

      Title: FLOUR TORTILLAS (MAKING)
 Categories: Breads, Mexican
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           Flour
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Baking powder
    1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
    2/3    To 3/4 cup very hot water
 
  Since tortillas freeze well, you can make a batch on a leisurely day
  and have a supply on hand. Mix the flour with the salt and baking
  powder. Using your hands, mix in the shortening until the mixture
  becomes a coarse, even meal. Mix in 2/3 cup of the water, adding it
  all at once, and knead for 2 minutes, or until the dough has the
  consistency of a stiff bread dough. If dry and crumbly, add extra
  water; if too moist, add a few tablespoons of additional flour. Cover
  the dough and allow it to rest for 20 minutes.
  
  Heat a skillet, saute pan, or griddle over medium-high heat until hot
  enough that a drop of water immediately sizzles and evaporates.
  
  You will be rolling and then cooking each tortilla, rather than
  rolling them all and then cooking them. Pinch off a piece of dough
  the size of a golfball and dust your hands and the dough ball with
  flour. Place the ball on a floured surface and flatten the ball with
  your hands into a circle 1/2 inch thick. Then, using a rolling pin,
  roll it twice in the same direction and form a circle 1/8 inch thick
  and about 8 to 9 inches in diameter. Immediately place it in the hot
  skillet and cook it for 30 to 45 seconds, or until bubbles begin to
  form on the top. If the tortilla puffs up into a pillow, push it down
  with a spatula. Turn and cook 20 seconds, remove with a spatula, and
  keep warm by placing it in a tea towel and covering it with the
  towel. Roll and cook remaining dough the same way.
  
  TO SOFTEN FLOUR TORTILLAS: Flour tortillas, like corn tortillas,
  become brittle when cold, and must be softened to become pliable for
  bending into quesadillas or rolling for chimichangas. To soften, heat
  a dry skillet, saute pan, or griddle over medium heat. Heat a
  tortilla for about 30 seconds, or until bubbles start to appear on
  top. Turn and heat the second side for about 15 seconds. Fold or roll
  immediately.

      2 ts Baking powder

      2 c  Tap-hot water
 
  Combine all ingredients except water.  Add water slowly, until dough
  is soft, but does not stick to hands. Knead dough until satiny.
  Softer dough is easier to roll. Make 2 inch balls of dough, and
  flatten, roll on floured surface with a light rolling pin. Cook on
  cast iron griddle, that has been preheated.  Griddle should be hot
  enough to burn dough in less than 20 seconds.   Adjustments are
  neces- sary, especially on electric stoves. Heat is approximately 300

      Title: FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE ROULADE WITH WHIPPED APRI
 Categories: Cakes, Fruits/nuts, Desserts
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      6 lg Egg yolks
    2/3 c  Superfine or strained sugar
    1/4 c  Superfine or strained sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ts Grated navel orange rind
      2 tb Fresh orange juice
    1/2 c  Strained Dutch-process cocoa
      6 lg Egg whites
      1 tb Water
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar

MMMMM------------------WHIPPED APRICOT SOUFFLE-----------------------
      3 oz Dried apricots
      1 c  Water; plus
      1 tb Water
    3/4 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/2 ts Unflavored gelatin
      1 c  Heavy cream; well-chilled
      1 tb Grand Marnier
 
  Position rack in lower third of oen and preheat to 350 degrees.
  Butter a 10 1/2 by 15 1/2 by 1 inch jellyroll pan and line the bottom
  with baking parchment. Lightly butter the parchment. Place the yolks
  in the small bowl of an electric mixer fitted with beaters or the
  whip attachment. Beat on medium speed until they are thickened and
  light yellow in color, about 2 minutes.  Add 2/3 c sugar, 1 Tbsp at a
  time, taking about 2 to 3 minutes to blend it in well. Reduce mixer
  speed to medium-low. Blend in the vanilla, orange rind, and orange
  juice, and mix for 15 seconds. Reduce speed to low, add the cocoa,
  and blend until just incorporated. Remove from the mixer and transfer
  to a larger mixing bowl. Set aside. Wash and dry beaters. In the
  large bowl of the mixer, whip the egg whites and water at medium
  speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar, increase the speed to
  medium-high, and continue beating until the whites form soft peaks.
  Add 1/4 c sugar, 1 Tbsp at a time, taking about 30 seconds. Whip for
  15 seconds longer. Do not overbeat.  Remove the bowl from the mixer.
  With a 2 3/4 inch wide rubber spatula, fold one quarter of the beaten
  egg whites into the yolk mixture, taking about 20 turns to lighten.
  Then fold in the remaining whites, taking an additional 30 to 40
  turns. Pour batter into the prepared pan and gently smooth the top
  with the back of a spoon, spreading it evenly into the corners.  Tap
  the pan gently on the counter to even out the batter. Bake in the
  preheated oben for 20 to 25 minutes, until the top feels set and is
  springy to the touch. While the cake is baking, prepare a 20-inch
  piece of baking parchment. Place on a flat work space and sprinkle
  lightly with 1/2 tsp granulated sugar. Remove cake from the oven and
  immediately invert onto the parchment. Protecting your hands with
  potholders, remove the pan and gently peel off the paper pan liner.
  Tightly roll together the cake and the sugared parchment paper away
  from you, starting on a long side. Place the cake seam side down on a
  cake rack to cool while you prepare the filling. To make the whipped
  apricot souffle: Put the apricots and 1 cup of water in a small heavy
  saucepan, cover, and bring to a boil. Simmer 20-25 minutes or until
  the apricots are very soft and all but 1 or 2 Tbsp of the water has
  been absorbed. Remove from the heat and add 1/2 c confectioners
  sugar. Whip with a fork until the apricots are very smooth. You
  should have approximately 1/2 c of puree. Put 1 Tbsp cold water in a
  small heat-proof glass dish and sprinkle the gelatin over the top.
  Let stand for 5 minutes without stirring. Place the dish in a skillet
  filled with 1/2 inch of boiling water.  Stir the mixture until the
  gelatin is dissolved and the mixture is clear.  Stir it into the
  apricot puree. Set aside to cool to tepid. Beat the cream in a small
  chilled bowl of an electric mixer. As it begins to thicken, add 1/4 c
  confectioner's sugar gradually. Beat until soft peaks form. Remove
  from the mixer and fold in the tepid puree and the Grand Marnier by
  hand. To assemble: Carefully unroll the cake, but not completely
  flat; the edge closest to you should remain curled. Spoon the filling
  under the curled edge first, then spread it over the rest of the cake
  evenly with a metal spatula, leaving a 1-inch border on the far side.
  To roll the cake, tuck the curled edge under and continue rolling.
  Place seam side down on a wooden breadboard or oblong platter. Cover
  loosely with foil and refrigerate until hald-hour before serving.
  Dust the top with confectioner's sugar just before serving. Store
  leftover roulade in the refrigerator loosely covered with foil for up
  to three days.

 Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
     10 oz Chocolate, bittersweet
    1/2 c  Butter, sweet; softened
    1/2 c  Sugar
      5    Egg; separated
      2 tb Rum, dark
    1/3 c  Walnuts; chopped
  2 1/2 c  Creme Ganache (below)
      3 c  English Toffee; crushed
           -(below)

MMMMM-----------------------CREME GANACHE----------------------------
      1 qt Heavy cream
      2 lb Bittersweet chocolate

MMMMM-----------------------ENGLISH TOFFEE----------------------------
      3 c  Walnuts; chopped
      3 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Light Karo
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 c  Butter, sweet
 
     Preheat the oven to 325.
  
     Butter an 8-inch cake pan and line the bottom with parchment
  paper. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Beat the butter with
  1/4 cup of the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks, two
  at a time, and then the rum, then the walnuts, beating well each time.
  
     In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites and the rest of the sugar
  until they are stiff and shiny.  Add the melted chocolate to the
  butter mixture and combine well. Fold in the egg whites and combine
  well, until there are no more white streaks.  Pour the mixture into
  the cake pan and bake about 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in
  the center comes out with a few crumbs.
  
       Cool the cake and then chill.
  
       Whip 2 1/2 cups of ganache until light and fluffy. Smooth a
  little of the ganache on top of the chilled cake. Sprinkle crushed
  toffee on top of the cake, and then cover the whole thing, top and
  sides, with ganache and chill for two hours.
  
       Serve the cake at room temperature.
  
       Ganache: Bring the cream to a boil in a 6-quart pot. When the
  cream boils, remove it from the heat immediately and add all the
  chocolate at once. Stir with a wire whisk until the chocolate is all
  melted. Pour into a bowl, allow to cool at room temperature, cover
  with plastic wrap, and chill. You can keep in the refrigerator for a
  week or in the freezer for several months.
  
       Toffee:  Preheat the oven to 175. Put nuts on a cookie sheet and
  place in the oven to keep warm. Coat another cookie tray with
  vegetable oil.
  
       Put the sugar, water, corn syrup, and vanilla in a heavy
  saucepan and stir well to dissolve the sugar. Wash down the sides of
  the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water so that there is no
  sugar clinging to the sides of the pan. Cook over high heat until it
  reaches a boil, continuing to wash down with water. After it has
  boiled for one minute, add the butter, stirring often. It is done
  when it registers 290 on a candy thermometer and it is the color of a
  brown paper bag. Remove from heat and stir in the walnuts. Pour the
  mixture onto the oiled sheet and let it cool completely.

    1/2 c  Matzo meal
      1 ts -Salt
  1 1/2 ts Dill, fresh; chopped
      2 tb Chicken soup; or water
 
  "Daliah Organ says that secret to making them fluffy is refrigerating
  the for at least 2 hours before shaping them, then cooking them for 1
  hour. Her whole family loves them, except Johnny,who likes matzo
  balls hard. For him, she removes a few after 1/2 hour of cooking.
  Dalian flavors them differently, according to her mood. Instead of
  the dill, she sometimes uses 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of sugar
  and sometimes uses ground green cardamom seeds. As it has more
  flavor, Daliah likes to use chicken fat rather than vegetable oil.
  She prefer Streit's matzo meal. The water that she cooks the matzo
  balls in is always well seasoned. She serves at least 2 per person."
  Combine eggs with chicken fat or oil. In another bowl, combine matzo
  meal, salt and dill. Stir 2 mixtures together, Add chicken soup or
  water. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. Shape mixture (it
  should be like dough) into golf-ball sized balls, moistening hands
  with water to prevent sticking. Drop balls into large pot of boiling
  water seasoned with salt and pepper. (The more matzo balls you are
  cooking the larger the pot should be.) Reduce heat, cover and simmer
  1 hour. After cooking, matzo balls should be the size of meatballs.
  Remove matzo balls from water and place in chicken soup to absorb
  flavor. MAKES: 4-6 SERVINGS

  1 1/2 c  Water
  2 1/2 tb Butter
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Vital gluten
      1 c  Milled popped popcorn
      3 c  Bread flour
      2 ts Yeast
 
  Pop popcorn. 1/2 cup popcorn yields 8 cups. Mill the popped popcorn.
  8 cups of popped popcorn will yield 4 cups of fluffy popcorn flour.
  Put ingredients in breadpan in order given. Set for rapid bake. The
  resulting loaf is high and light--the texture almost of "Wonder
  Bread" but much more flavorful. I milled the popcorn in my electic
  Miracle Mill but the hand mills should work fine,too. Popcorn must be
  compressed a bit as it's entering the mill and a wooden lemon reamer
  works well as a "stuffer". Do NOT attempt to mill unpopped popcorn in
  your electric mill. I can only break those hard kernels with my Back
  to Basics hand mill. The extra popcorn flour can be frozen in a
  ziploc and stored for future loaves. The fragrance is wonderful!

  Cook the bacon until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Combine the
  mayonnaise with cilantro and parsley. Cut each focaccia in half,
  forming 4 (8x4-inch) rectangles. Spread half of the mayonnaise on top
  of 2 of the focaccia halves. Layer half of the turkey, tomato, bacon,
  avocado, and alfalfa sprouts onto each. Spread the bottoms of the
  focaccia with more mayonnaise and cover the sandwich fillings. Cut
  into halves or thirds.
  
  NOTE: Commercially produced mayonnaise may be substituted. Focaccia
  (round or square), purchased at Italian delis, may be used.
  
  FOR MAYONNAISE: Combine the eggs, lemon juice, mustard, and hot pepper
  sauce in a blender or food processor. Blend 5 to 10 seconds. With the
  blender still running, add the oil in a very slow stream through the
  opening in blender cover. Blend until smooth, scraping sides
  occasionally for even blending. Season to taste with salt.
  
  FOR FOCACCIA: Allow the bread dough to thaw 2 to 4 hours or overnight
  in the refrigerator. Cut dough in half and roll out each half to make
  an 8-inch square. If the dough pulls back, let rest 15 to 30 seconds
  and roll out again. Place the dough in 2 greased 8-inch square baking
  pans. Thoroughly pierce dough at 1-inch intervals with a fork. Saute
  the onion and garlic in olive oil until lightly browned. Add the
  seasoning and brush the mixture over the dough squares. Let rise 10
  minutes. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden
  brown. Let cool.

      Title: FOCCACIA WITH FRUIT & NUTS
 Categories: Mc, Pizzas
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Currants or chopped raisins
      3 c  Bread flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      1 pk 50% faster or RapidRise
           -yeast
    3/4 c  Hot water
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans,, toasted
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary
    1/2 c  Grated imported Parmesan
           -cheese
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet.
  Pour 3 tablespoons of the olive oil into a small glass bowl and heat
  at full power in the microwave until very hot, 30 to 45 seconds.
  Stir in the currants and heat an additional 20 seconds then set them
  aside to plump. In a mixer or processor bowl fitted with the steel
  blade, combine 2 1/2 cups flour, the salt, sugar, and yeast. Mix. Add
  the hot water. Knead until soft, adding additional flour as needed to
  eliminate stickiness. Add the oil and the raisins (if using a food
  processor reserve half), the pecans, and rosemary and knead the dough
  sufficiently to mix in the fruit, nuts, and herb. (Knead in the rest
  of the raisins by hand if the rest was done with a food processor.)
  Form the dough into a ball. With your thumbs, punch a hole to form a
  doughnut shape and place in an oiled plastic bag or the processor
  bowl. If in a bowl, cover loosely with a damp tea towel or plastic
  wrap. Place in the microwave. Place an 8-ounce glass of water in the
  back of the microwave. Lower the microwave power to 10% or the next
  to the lowest power setting. Heat for 3 minutes. Rest for 3 minutes.
  Repeat heating for 3 minutes and resting for 3 minutes. Heat for the
  third time 3 minutes but rest 6 minutes until the dough has doubled
  in bulk. Remove the dough from the processor bowl, punch down, and
  knead by hand a few seconds. Roll the dough into a 9 x 13-inch
  rectangle and place on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with the
  remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with the Parmesan.
  Allow the dough to rise again, about 20 minutes or until nearly
  doubled. Bake until the foccacia is puffy and golden brown, about 25
  minutes. Cool on a wire rack and cut into squares to serve. Serves 6

      Title: FOCCACIA WITH PARMESAN
 Categories: Cyberealm, Breads, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 pk Yeast, not instant
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Warm water
  2 3/4 c  Bread flour
      6 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Salt
      4 tb Grated parmesan cheese
    1/2 ts Dried rosemary, crushed
      1 tb Cornmeal
      1 ts Coarse salt
           Black pepper
 
  1. Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in 3/4 cup warm water, about 110
  degrees. Set aside for 15 minutes until very foamy.

  olive oil, 1/2 t regular salt, parmesan and rosemary.
  
  4. Add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft and workable
  dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic,
  about 10 minutes.
  
  5. Oil a large bowl. Put the dough into the bowl, cover loosely and
  let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  6. Sprinkle a baking sheet with the cornmeal. Divide the dough into 4
  parts and roll each into a circle about 7 in. in diameter. Place on
  the baking sheet. Use the tips of your fingers to make the dimples in
  the dough. Spoon a tablespoon of olive oil on each bread piece and
  sprinkle with the coarse salt and pepper.
  
  7. Bake in a preheated 475F oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown.

      Title: FOG CITY DINER'S TOMATO KETCHUP
 Categories: Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 lb Ripe plum tomatoes, coarsely
           -chopped
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Cider vinegar
      1 tb Minced garlic
    3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Mixed pickling spice
      1 sm Stick cinnamon, about 1/4
           -inch long
  1 1/2 ts Dry mustard
    1/2 ts (scant) freshly ground
           -pepper
      2 tb Cornstarch dissolved in
    1/4 c  Cold water
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  The Fog City Diner was one of the places that came along with the
  diner revival of a few years back.  It is, or was, a trendy place
  over in the City.  I think it may have closed after the '89 quake,
  but I'm not sure about that.
  
  Combine the tomatoes, sugar, vinegar, garlic, salt, pickling spice,
  cinnamon, dry mustard and pepper in a large, heavy stainless steel or
  enameled saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat,
  stirring occasionally.  Reduce the heat and simmer the ketchup,
  uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the ketchup
  from the heat and let it cool a few minutes.
  
  Force the ketchup through a fine sieve to strain it, pressing down
  hard on the solids.  Rinse out the saucepan and return the ketchup to
  a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat and
  simmer the ketchup, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. (Even if the
  ketchup seems thin, do not cook it any longer, as the thickening
  power of the cornstarch lessens with prolonged cooking.  The ketchup
  will thicken a bit more upon cooling.) Remove the ketchup from the
  heat and let it cool to room temperature. Store the tomato ketchup,
  covered, in the refrigerator for up to a month.
  
  Makes about 5 cups.

      Title: FOIL DINNERS
 Categories: Digest, Mar95, Camping, Hiking
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Onion sliced
      1    Bell pepper sliced
      1    Zuchini sliced
      3    Or 4 carrots sliced
      6    Mushrooms
      6 sm Red potatoes cubed (large)
      1 ea Falafel mix
      1 ea Any seasoning you like (I
           Like cayenne and black
           Pepper)
 
  Start charcoals. Mix the falafel per instructions. Cut all vegetables.
  
  When falafel is ready, get a piece of foil big enough to fit all the
  ingredients.  (You'll know how big after you do your first one!) Put
  shiny side in.  (I don't know why, just do it!)
  
  Put some falafel mix in the middle, shape like an oblong pattie. Put
  some of each vegetable on top, watch for carrots that like to roll
  off. :-) Sprinkle lots of seasoning.
  
  Now the tricky part, closing the foil.  You make a boat and take the
  long sides, put them together and roll a couple of times (as many as
  you can). You then take the ends and roll them upwards as far as you
  can. I take another piece of foil and wrap it again the same way in
  the same direction. You want to do it in such a way that no juice or
  steam can escape.
  
  Do this until you are out of food.  I made six good sized dinners with
  falafel and 2 with just vegetables. I probably used between 1.5 and 2
  cups of falafel mix.
  
  Put foil dinners on coals, making sure there are no flames. After
  about 15 minutes, you can flip the dinners. When you start to smell
  the food, it probably is done.  You really need to just make sure the
  vegetables are cooked. You can check a dinner at any time and just
  close it back up if it's not ready.
  
  This is a really great dinner.  Serve with bread if you have it. I
  like to put picante sauce on mine.

      Title: FOLDING THE FLAG
 Categories: Misc., Holidays
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Info
 
  Though most commonly flown on flag holidays, such as Flag Day,
  Independence Day, and Veteran's Day, the United States flag can be
  displayed from sunrise to sunset on any day of the year-and at
  nighttime, too, as long as it's properly illuminated.  When not on
  display, it should be respectfully folded into the shape of a
  three-cornered hat, emblematic of those worn by Colonial soldiers in
  the Revolutionary War. It takes two people to do it properly. Both
  should hold the flag waist-high, with its surface parallel to the
  ground. (Maintain a secure hold throughout, and never allow any part
  of the flag to touch the ground.) 1. Fold the flag in half
  lengthwise, bringing the striped section over the canton (the blue
  field of stars). 2. Fold it again lengthwise, bringing the canton to
  the outside. 3. Make a triangular fold at the striped end, bringing
  the folded edge over to meet the open edge.  4.  Fold the outer point
  up, forming a second triangle. 5. to 11. Continue fold the flag in
  this manner seven more times. The last triangular fold brings the red
  and white stripes into the star-strewn blue field, symbolizing the
  day's light vanishing into the darkness of the night. 12.  Tuck the
  remaining flap into the pocket formed between the star and stripes.

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      3 c  Sugar
  1 1/3 c  Water
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Light corn syrup
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  DIRECTIONS: Mix first 4 ingredients in large saucepan. Bring to boil,
  stirring. Cover, boil 3 minutes. Remove cover, and cook until a small
  amount of mixture forms a soft ball when dropped in cold water
  (238-F). Wash down sides of pan several times with a pastry brush
  dipped in cold water, using up and down motion. Pour out on ungreased
  platter. Cool to lukewarm (110-F). Add vanilla, and beat until
  mixture turns cloudy. Gather into a ball, and knead with lightly
  buttered hands until smooth and creamy. Put in bowl, cover with damp
  cloth, and store in cool place until needed.
  
  FONDANT DIPPED ALMONDS: Tint fondant with red and green food
  coloring. If desired, flavor green with wintergreen and red with
  peppermint. Melt each color in top part of double boiler over hot
  water. Dip rounded end of toasted almonds in candy; harden on waxed
  paper.
  
  FONDANT STUFFED DATES: Color fondant with red and green food
  coloring, as desired. Shape in small rolls, and fill pitted dates.
  
  BONBONS: Using 2/3 of fondant recipe for any one flavor of bonbon,
  work in desired flavoring and coloring a little at a time. Shape in
  3/4" balls for centers. Bits of nuts, candied or dried fruits, or
  coconut can be added to these centers. Let stand on waxed paper,
  covered, overnight.
  
  Next day, melt remaining 1/3 of the fondant set aside for this batch
  in top part of metal double boiler over boiling water, adding
  flavoring and coloring to match fondant centers. Remove from heat.
  Set pan in cold water for a moment, and then put over hot (not
  boiling) water to keep fondant warm and soft. With dipping fork, or
  other fork, dip bonbon centers, one at a time, in melted fondant to
  cover. (Stir after each bonbon is dipped to keep crust from forming
  on top. If this fondant becomes too thick, reheat or add a few drops
  of hot water.) Tip bonbon over onto waxed paper covered tray.
  Decorative circles can be made by holding dipping fork on top of
  bonbon for a moment. Decorate at once with bits of nuts, candied
  fruits, silver shot or colored sugar, as desired. Leftover dipping
  fondant can be dropped on waxed paper to make patties. Store,
  covered, in cool, dry place.

      Title: FONDUE CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 80 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
      4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    1/2 lb (8 ounces) Swiss cheese,
           Shredded (2 to 2-1/2 cups,
           Loosely packed)
    1/4 c  Water
 
  "If you want the flavor of cheese fondue, but don't want the fuss and
  commotion, try these crackers. You may never bother with the real
  thing again. These cheese crackers are very rich, but very light.
  They are excellent with a light Alsatian Gewurztraminer or Grey
  Riesling. 325~F. 25 to 30 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, mix the flour, salt,
  pepper, and nutmeg. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal. Add the cheese and blend until it is evenly coated.
  Blend in the water to form a dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface of pastry cloth, roll out to about 3/8 inch thick. Cut into
  bite-sized squares (about 1 inch by 1 inch). Arrange on an ungreased
  sheet, making sure the edges of the crackers are not touching.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes. Turn the crackers over and continue baking
  another 10 to 15 minutes, until medium brown. These crackers should
  be crisp. Cool them on racks. Yield: 70-80.
  
  VARIATIONS: For a more traditional fondue taste, add 1 teaspoon
  Kirsch or cherry liqueur when adding the water. And use two different
  types of Swiss cheese, such as Gruyere and Emmenthaler. From: Jr Byers

  Gradually stir in the cheese, a handful at a time. Allow it to melt
  completely between each addition. When all the cheese has been added
  the mixture should be bubbling and smooth.
  
  Stir in the relish.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Keep
  the mixture warm over a burner, seat your guests down, fill their
  wine glasses and enjoy your meal.
  
  I often add more cheese than the recipe calls for. You can use any of
  the following as dippers with the fondue:
  
  :  o  Mushroom caps, sauteed quickly in butter, tossed in chopped
  parsley :  o  Whole, peeled and deveined prawns
  :  o  Fresh pineapple chunks
  :  o  Canned artichoke hearts, well drained and halved
  :  o  Unpeeled apple wedges, thick banana slices or peeled pear
  quarters :  o  Thick cucumber slices or chunks
  :  o  Small whole radishes
  :  o  Cauliflower
  :  o  A small French loaf per person
  :  o  Anything else that tickles your fancy
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cheese fondue with curry flavor -- This is a very tasty meal and a
  lot of fun as well. You will need to have a crockery fondue pot and a
  burner, as all the cooking happens on your dinner table with your
  guests doing all their own cooking! My wife and I enjoy a fondue with
  dinner guests or simply by ourselves, and this is one of our
  favourites. This recipe is adopted from one published by the
  Australian Dairy Corporation many years ago.
  
  *  Toss fruit in lemon juice to prevent browning.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  40 minutes preparation, cooking takes as long as it takes
  you to eat it.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK

  Bring up corners and tie securely.  Tie end to children's belt loop
  or attach to a stick and send them off on their hobo hike. Pack
  another hobo pouch for yourself and go along.  Make sure someone has
  a Scout knife with a can opener attachment to open cans (much more
  fun struggling with one of these things than to take a conventional
  can opener).  The oranges serve as both a drink and a dessert.  Poke
  a hole in one end and after all the juice has been sucked out, open
  it and eat the flesh. The tuna and beans, of course, are eaten just
  as they come from the can. The bandanas serve as little tablecloths,
  napkins, and kerchiefs to be worn back home. Children love this hobo
  picnic--it's easy for you, nutritious, filling, and fun from them.

  added a bit of a bottled fatfree dressing intended for salads and put
  it over pasta.

        x  Bread
        x  Tomato paste

  Luckily, I don't have a family to feed, other than the furry critters
  who share my abode.  But I often suffer from the Dead Brain Syndrome,
  so that's when I get out a loaf of bread, slice off a chunk of it,
  and get creative with veggie pizza in the toaster oven.  Slice the
  chunk of bread lengthwise, as if you were going to make a sandwich
  out of it, toast it for a few minutes, then spread some tomato paste
  or sauce on it. Top it with your favorite veg-pizza toppings and
  stick it back into the toaster oven for about 5 minutes, or however
  long it takes to bake or broil the toppings. You can get as creative
  as you like with this.

      1    Egg yolk; beaten, mixed with
      2 tb Water
 
  GREASE AND FLOUR 10 small fluted 1/3-cup brioche tins. Or use 1 3-cup
  brioche pan. Dissolve yeast and a pinch of sugar in warm water. In
  food processor or mixer, add flour and the rest of the sugar. Beat in
  the cool butter. Add yeast and water; beat in the 3 eggs, 1 at a
  time. Beat until shiny and glossy, and the dough forms long slick
  strings with an adhesive quality. If the food processor turns off,
  the dough is ready. Place it in an oiled plastic bag or oiled bowl;
  turn to coat. Seal or cover. Let rise in a warm place until tripled.
  Punch down and let rise again covered, in the refrigerator for 6
  hours or overnight. Take 2/3 of the now-spongy dough and, working
  quickly, form into balls. Put balls in tins. Cut a deep cross in the
  center of each ball. With remaining dough, form small pear-shaped
  knobs. Fit the pointed ends of the knobs into the center of each
  cross, pressing firmly in place. Let rise, uncovered, in a warm place
  until the dough doubles.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN to 375F. Brush dough with egg glaze. Bake 20 minutes, or
  until browned. For a quick brioche, cover dough in the greased bowl
  with plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Grease
  brioche forms or muffin tins. When dough is chilled, knead it with
  floured hands. It should not require any more flour. Shape. Brush all
  over with glaze. Let double 15 to 20 minutes, and bake in a 400F
  oven, about 10 minutes or until brown.

      Title: FOOD PROCESSOR WALNUT BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  Light brown sugar, packed
      1 c  Warm water (105F-to-115F)
      3 c  Bread flour
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Walnut or vegetable oil
  1 1/2 c  Walnut pieces; toasted

MMMMM---------------------FOR GLAZE, COMBINE--------------------------
      1 lg Egg; frothed with fork
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into warm water; let stand until foamy, about 5
  minutes. Put both flours, salt and oil into food processor work bowl
  fitted with metal blade. Turn processor on to combine mixture. With
  processor running, slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans
  sides of bowl. If dough is too sticky, add more flour by the
  tablespoon, working it in before adding more. If dough is too dry and
  crumbly, add more water by the teaspoon, working it in before adding
  more. Once desired consistency is reached, process dough until well
  kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds. Add walnut
  pieces and process for 10 seconds. Remove blade. Then remove dough
  from bowl and press all loose walnuts into it. Transfer dough to
  large plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal at top. Place dough in
  bowl. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Oil baking
  sheet. Punch dough down and shape into smooth ball. Place round side
  up on baking sheet. Cover loosely with oiled plastic. Let rise in
  warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. 15 minutes before baking,
  preheat oven to 400F, with rack in center of oven. When loaf has
  doubled, slash loaf for surface design. Lightly brush with glaze.
  Bake until loaf is deeply browned and sounds hollow when rapped on
  the bottom, about 35 minutes. Immediately remove from pan to cool on
  rack.
  
  NOTE: (To toast nuts, spread single layer on jelly roll pan and bake
  in 350F oven until fragrant and toasted, 8-to-10 minutes, watching
  carefully to avoid burning) Makes 1 Loaf

  "When the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture brought out its new food guide
  pyramid, at least one group felt left out: vegetarians. A nutrition
  expert from New York Medical College has now remedied the problem.
  
  "Arlene Spark, Ph.D., clinical assc. prof. of nutrition, developed a
  pyramid that helps nonmeat eaters build a healthful diet. Her pyramid
  matches the USDA version in overall organization, but it offers
  substitutes for the meat/fish group and for the dairy group. In
  addition, the veg. pyramid includes special recommendations for
  vegans....These recommendations ensure that vegans obtain all needed
  nutrients."
  
  Top portion of pyramid: "Vegans Must Consume Daily" veg. oil (3-5
  tsp) and Blackstrap molasses (1 tbs.) and Brewer's yeast (1 tbs.)
  
  2nd portion: "Milk and Milk Substitutes Group" milk, yogurt, cheese
  and fortified soy milk (with added calcium, vitamins B12 and D) (2-4
  servings)
  
  "Meat/Fish Substitutes Group" dry beans, nuts, seeds, peanut butter,
  tofu, and eggs (2-3 servings)
  
  3rd portion:  "Vegetable Group" 3+ servings
  
  "Fruit Group" 2-4 servings
  
  4th portion (bottom of pyramid): "Grains and Starchy Vegetables Group"
  bread, cereal, rice, pasta, corn, potatoes, and green peas (6-11
  servings)

      Title: FOOLPROOF GNOCCHI (OVO)
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    5-oz  box instant potato
           Buds
      2 c  Boiling water
      1    Egg's worth egg replacer (or
           Two egg whites -- necessary
           For binding)
      2 c  Flour (whole wheat works
           Fine)
 
  Mix the potato buds and water together like mashed potatoes. Cool.
  Add egg replacer and flour. Knead lightly on floured board. Take a
  small protion at a time and roll on flloured board into strips about
  1 inch thick. Cut small pieces about 1 inch long. Roll each piece
  over a fork, making an impression with your thumb, to give the pieces
  the classic gnocchi shape. Be sure to keep the dough floured well, or
  it will become sticky. Place the peices on a floured cookie sheet,
  making sure they don't touch. Drop the pieces into boiling water.
  After they reach the surface (which may be almost immediately), cook
  them _gently_ (don't boil them!) for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and serve
  with the sauce of your choice.
  
  I'd be interested to hear any experiences you might have with the
  recipe.

      Title: FOOLPROOF SOURDOUGH STARTER 3
 Categories: Breads, Sourdough, Book
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Active dry yeast
  2 1/2 c  Warm water
  2 1/2 c  White flour, preferably
           -unbleached
 
  Let yeast dissolve in 1/2 cup warm water in a pottery or glass bowl,
  then stir in flour and 2 cups warm water; mix well. Pour into
  plastic, glass, or crockery container, cover, and let stand 3-5 days
  in a warm place - near but not directly over the stove pilot light is
  a good choice.
  
  When the mixture is ready to use, it may be stabilized by being kept
  in the refrigerator.  When the liquid rises to the top, mix gently
  with a fork to blend before using.
  
  Feed the starter every 5 days by mixing in 1/2 cup flour and 1/3 cup
  warm water.
  
  Each time the starter is used, reserve at least 1 cup, replacing the
  amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water.

  After the dough has been punched down and allowed to rest (step 3):
  
  4. On a floured board, shape the dough into a roll about 20 inches
  long. with A sharp knife, cut the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces.
  Let it rest again, covered with a cloth or plastic wrap.
  
  5. Using the palms of your hands, roll each piece of dough into a
  roll 3/4 to 1 inch diameter and about 9 to 10 inches long (or
  whatever size will fit on your baking sheet). Twist each piece, if
  desired, to make twisted bread sticks. Place each piece on a lightly
  oiled baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. (Make sure the pieces
  about 2 inches apart; use 2 baking sheets, but be sure to put them on
  the same rack.)
  
  6. Cover the dough loosely with a cloth or plastic wrap and let it
  rise in a warm place until doubled in size. Lightly brush each bread
  stick with egg glaze sprinkle with cornmeal.
  
  7. Preheat the oven to 350F. For soft bread sticks, bake for 12 to 15
  minutes, until lightly browned. Watch carefully, or they will become
  too dry if overcooked. Cool on a wire rack and store in an airtight
  container. Serve warm with cilantro, garlic and cumin-spiced soft
  butter. If you like harder bread sticks, bake them in a 30 oven for
  about 30 minutes or until very crispy and nicely browned.

      Title: FOR SAFETY'S SAKE
 Categories: Information, Canning
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  Pressure canning is the only recommended method for canning meat,
  poultry, seafood, and vegetables.  The bacterium 'Clostridium
  botulinum' is destroyed in low-acid foods when they are processed at
  the correct time and pressure in pressure canners.  Using boiling
  water canners for these foods poses a real risk of botulism poisoning.
  
  If Clostridium botulinum bacteria survive and grow inside a sealed
  jar of food, they can produce a poisonous toxin. Even a taste of food
  containing this toxin can be fatal. Boiling food 10 minutes at
  altitudes below 1,000 feet destroys this poison when it is present.
  For altitudes at and above 1,000 feet, add 1 minute per 1,000 ft.
  additional elevation. Caution: To prevent the risk of botulism,
  low-acid and tomato foods not canned according to the recommendations
  in this publication or according to other USDA-endorsed
  recommendations should be boiled as above, even if you detect no
  signs of spoilage. All low-acid foods canned according to the
  approved recommendations may be eaten without boiling them when you
  are sure of all the following:
  
  * Food was processed in a pressure canner.
  
  * Gauge of the pressure canner was accurate.
  
  * Up-to-date researched process times and pressures were used for the
  size of jar, style of pack, and kind of food being processed.
  
  * The process time and pressure recommended for sterilizing the food
  at your altitude was followed.
  
  * Jar lid is firmly sealed and concave.
  
  * Nothing has leaked out when jar is opened.
  
  * No liquid spurts out when jar is opened.
  
  * No unnatural or "off" odors can be detected.

  Espresso coffee (no recipe) Light California champagne (no recipe)
  
  ~=> Serving Suggestion Starched blue linen, crystal serving dishes,
  white porcelain and sterling champagne glasses all bring a touch of
  elegance to an intimate deck-side gathering. Arched candelabra with
  tall white tapes would be perfect for illuminating the fondue dish.
  Each guest could be handed a porcelain salad size plate with blue
  linen napkin folded on top and frosted sliver champagne glass.
  Remember to preheat your best demitasse cups for the expresso.
  
  ~=> Red Caviar Canapes chopped chives
  
  Mix onion juice, lemon juice and cream cheese.  Using a pastry tube,
  form a crown of this mixture on rounds of toast. From the jar of

  exposed. Place them in a plastic container and sprinkle the powdered
  sugar over them. Add the rum, vodka and Triple Sec and gently tumble

  fondue dish or chafing dish until it is at least 3 inches deep. Heat
  the oil t about 360~ or until it will cokk a test chunk of meat in
  three minutes. Each guest spears a chunk of beef with a fondue fork
  and cooks it to taste in the hot oil. (It's nice to mark the forks
  with a colored dot on a piece of tape so they will be recognized).
  After the pieces of meat are cooked, each guest dips the choice
  morsel into one of the variety of elegant sauces.

      2    Pheasant breasts
           - (from 3 lb pheasants)
           - boned, skinned & halved
           Salt
           White pepper
      2 tb Butter
 
  Prepare the fettucine.  Clean any soil clinging to the morel stems.
  Place the mushrooms in a spice mill and grind to a fine powder.
  Combine the powder with the semolina and all-purpose flours in a food
  processor and process briefly to blend.  Beat the eggs, egg yolks and
  oil together and, with the motor running, add the mixture to the
  flours. Process until a neat ball forms on top of the blade, about 45
  to 60 seconds. Remove the dough from the machine and knead for a
  minute on a very lightly floured surface. Pat into a thick cylinder
  and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  
  About 1 hour before serving time, cut the dough across into 6 pieces.
  Knead, stretch, and cut each piece in a pasta machine or by hand.
  Spread the fettucine on a tray dusted with semolina. Cover with a
  towel until cooking time.
  
  Prepare the sauce.  Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 5
  minutes.  (Halve and rinse fresh morels.) Drain the mushrooms, halve
  them lengthwise and rinse briefly. Cut into small pieces. Heat the
  butter in a skillet and add the morels and shallots. Cook over low
  heat until the shallots are tender.  Add the cream and simmer,
  stirring often, until the sauce is lightly thickened, about 15
  minutes. Season with salt, white pepper and nutmeg to taste.  The
  sauce can be prepared and gently reheated just before serving.
  
  Rub any fuzz from the fiddlehead ferns and trim the tails to leave
  about 1/2 inch.  Drop them into boiling salted water and cook until
  tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well. At serving time, heat them
  through in the butter.
  
  About 20 minutes before serving time, sprinkle the pheasant breasts
  lightly with salt and white pepper and let them sit at room
  temperature until you are ready to cook. Heat the butter in a large,
  heavy skillet. When it foams, add the breasts and brown lightly for
  about 5 minutes. Turn and cook over moderately low heat until they
  are nicely browned and barely done in the center, about 5 more
  minutes. Remove them and let them sit for 5 minutes.
  
  Drop the noodles into a large quantity of boiling salted water.
  Return to a boil, stirring.  Cook about 1 minute, just until tender.
  Drain them thoroughly and toss with three-quarters of the sauce.
  
  Arrange the fettucine on 4 serving plates.  Slice each pheasant
  breast in 6 vertical slices and fan over the pasta. Top with the
  remaining sauce and surround with the fiddlehead ferns.

      2 ea Eggs
    1/3 c  Honey
    1/2 c  Unbleached flour
    1/3 ts Banana; or lemon extract
      1 ea Beat the eggs with the egg
           -beater or the electric
           Mixer for two minutes.
      2 ea Add the honey gradually to
           -the eggs and beat for 10
           MINUTES more.
      3 ea Slowly add the flour to the
           -egg/honey mixture after
 
  the 10 minutes of beating. Keep beating until the mixture is smooth.
  4. Add the extract and beat for 2 more minutes. 5. Warm the frying
  pan over a low heat (or turn the electric grill on to low). 6. Drop
  the cookie batter by tablespoons into the frying pan or onto the
  electric grill. Make sure that you leave space between cookies; you
  don't want them running into each other in the pan. You will have to
  make several batches. 7. Toast the cookies about 1/2 minute on each
  side. Turn them over with the spatula. Keep cooking and turning them
  until they are light brown. This should only take a few minutes. 8.
  As each panful is toasted and while the cookies are still hot, remove
  the cookies, place them on a clean surface and place a strip of your
  fortune telling paper into the center of each. Fold up* the cookies.
  9. Put the cookies on a rack to cool. 10. Make another batch. Notes:
  FOLDING: This is a case of a picture being worth a thousand words,
  but the general idea is: 1. Fold the cookie in half, (with the
  fortune inside). 2. Bring the two "points/corners" together towards
  the back, as if you were going to fold into quarters, but keep the
  pancake flat. "You can have some fun with your family and friends
  with these cookies. Before you begin baking them, write out fortunes
  on 18 Small pieces of paper (about 1/2x1-1/2 inches). Set these aside
  within easy reach because you will be inserting them in the cookies
  as you make them. ++++-

      Title: FOUGASSE AUX GRATTONS (FLAT BREAD WITH CRACKL
 Categories: Breads, Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 ea Pkg active dry yeast
      1 lb Flour*
    250 ml Tepid water
      1 ea Egg yolk, beaten
      1 lb Belly of pork, diced
      2 lb Pork fat, diced
     12 tb Dry white wine
 
  *Flour should be a mixture of unbleached white bread flour with 2
  generous handfuls of buckwheat flour, sifted together. If you can't
  find the buckwheat flour, don't worry about it.
  
  For the dough: Stir together the yeast and a handful of flour in
  enough water to make a runny batter. Leave for 1 hour. Warm the
  remaining flour in the oven, mix in salt and make a well in the
  middle. Pour in the yeast mixture and add enough tepid water to make
  a moist dough. Knead for 10-12 minutes on a lightly floured surface.
  Leave to rise in a large floured bowl covered with a dampened cloth.
  When the dough has doubled in size, turn out onto a floured work
  surface, punch down and flatten the dough out. Add the grattons (see
  immediately below for how to make them). Preheat the oven to
  450F/250C.
  
  For the grattons: Cook the meat, fat and wine over a *very* gentle
  heat in a heavy covered saucepan. Press down on the meat several
  times during cooking to render up as much fat as possible. After 1
  1/2 - 2 hours, pour the liquid off through a strainer. (It can be
  used instead of olive oil for cooking, and often was, in Provencal
  cooking.) Crisp the diced meat over higher heat, straining off any
  liquid fat when necessary.
  
  To make the fougasse, make the bread dough, and after the first
  rising mix in the grattons. Then, with a knife, cut through the dough
  first one way, then another. Reform into a ball and repeat. Gather
  the pieces together into a mass, divine in two and form into two flat
  loaves, slashed straight through their thickness in numerous places.
  Spread the holes wider with your fingers. (You are striving for an
  effect like a flat sheet of bread with holes like those of a slice of
  swiss cheese.) Brush the top with the egg yolk and bake on a hot
  metal sheet for 30-35 minutes until crisp and golden. Serve warm with
  a bitter salad like endive or dandelion.
  
  NB:  this is a very rich bread -- more like a salty shortbread than
  anything else.  But *very* good.

      1    Info below
 
                                FOUL FERNS
  
  "Just as undercooked meat or fowl can make a meal sickening, so, too,
  raw or lightly cooked ostrich fern may cause nausea, vomiting, and
  diarrhea. Though harvested commercially for years in the northeastern
  United States and in western Canada as a seasonal delicacy,
  _Matteucia struthiopteris_ seems to be the common element in several
  outbreaks of food poisoning this past May, according to the Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.
  
  "At one time time, native Americans in eastern North America
  considered this fern a spring vegetable, one adopted by Canadian
  settlers in the 1700s, the CDC notes.
  
  "Nevertheless, in New York, one restaurant received complaints from 40
  people who ate fiddleheads sauteed for 2 minutes, while no one who ate
  similarly harvested ferns cooked 10 minutes at another eatery
  experienced symptoms.  Likewise three outbreaks occurred in western
  Canada, two at restaurants that also cooked the ferns just briefly."
  
  "Health department officials tested uncooked ferns for bacterial and
  pesticide contamination but found neither. Nor did they track any
  other possible causes, the CDC reports in the Step 23 Morbidity and
  Mortality Weekly Report.  They conclude that the ferns may contain a
  toxin that adequate cooking--steaming for 10 minutes or boiling for
  15 minutes-- destroys."

      4 ea 2" squares sizzling rice
           -(recipe follows)
           -salad oil
 
   This soup makes a showy presentation.  At the table you slide fried
  rice cakes into the soup to create a crackling, sizzling sound.
  Actually, you can add the rice cakes to almost any soup and give the
  soup a sizzling name.  The trick is to be sure that both rice cakes
  and soup are piping hot.
   In a bowl, blend soy, sherry and cornstarch.  Add prok and mix until
  well coated.  Let stand for ten minutes. In a 2-quart pan, heat
  chicken broth to boiling.  Add pork, stir several times, then reduce
  heat and simmer for five minutes.  Add mushrooms, water chestnuts,
  and peas. Simmer, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Add green onion, salt to
  taste and sesame oil.
   Keep soup hot while you fry sizzling rice cakes per recipe. Pour hot
  soup into a warm tureen and carry to the table. Bring hot fried rice
  cakes to the table in a bowl and immediately slide into the soup.

 Categories: Breadmaker

           -CELESTE BEATIE   (TFDX72B)
      2 ts Yeast
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Powdered buttermilk
      3 c  Better for Bread Flour
           -(it does make a diff.)
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Majoram;
           -(dried crumbled leaves)
      1 ts Basil;
           -(Dried crumbled leaves)
    1/2 ts Thyme; (ground)
      2 ts Dill weed; (dried)
      2 tb Butter; softened
      1 c  -warm water.
 
  This recipe works well in the large size loaf machines. I have a Dak
  R2D2 machine. If you don't have the herbs called for, you can
  substitute whatever herbs you like. Put all the ingredients in, in
  the order listed (if using a dak), or in the order your machine
  likes. Select the white bread setting and a medium crust setting.
  Depending on your climate you may need to add a TBS more of water. I
  usually use Gluten, but when I first made this WITH gluten it
  exploded over the top of the pan and onto the dome. So I dont put
  gluten in the recipe. I think it has something to do with the B for B
  flour. I seem to use less gluten in the breads when I am using that
  flour. Formatted by Elaine Radis

      2 md Size fresh tomatoes
      8 sm Stalks of bok choy

      1 ts Peanut oil
    1/4 ts Sugar
           Cornstarch paste
      2 tb Chicken oil (rendered fat)
 
  Preparation:  Have water in steamer boiling.  Dip tomatoes to loosen
  skins; remove skins; slice in half. Wash and trim bok choy stalks.
  Use slender end of stalk only (use leaves and thick stalk in other
  dish). Drain baby corn and straw mushrooms.
  
  Steaming:  First steam baby corn and straw mushrooms for 5 minutes.
  Place tomatoes and bok choy on separate plate; sprinkle with salt;
  steam for 3 minutes; drain. Arrange vegetables on warm round serving
  platter in flower pattern.
  
  Sauce:  To render chicken fat, place pieces in small saucepan with a
  few drops of oil to prevent sticking. Cook on medium heat for 20
  minutes or so, until chicken oil separates from solids. Drain oil,
  reserve. Alternatively, make aromatic oil by steeping several peeled
  garlic cloves in hot cooking oil (after removing it from heat). In
  small saucepan, heat chicken stock, peanut oil and sugar.  When it
  starts to boil, dribble in enough cornstarch paste to give a light
  body. Keep warm until ready to use. When vegetables are being
  steamed, reheat sauce with chicken oil. Pour sauce over vegetables.
  Serve.

  and a touch of onion about 10 minutes before serving. Third day: For
  lunch, the soup is good cold with a dollop of creme frai'che. Fourth
  day: Add 2 or 3 peeled and diced beets, another cup of finely
  chopped, cooked cabbage, 3 or 4 more mushrooms, and if any, a little
  left over vegetable broth cooked from another day. NOTE: Of course,
  if you have some chicken or vegetable broth you can add it to the
  soup. The secret is to have variations of color, texture and flavor.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Starter *
      4    To 6 egg yolks plus warm
           -water to make 2 cups
  1 1/2 c  Cold water
  1 1/2 c  White flour
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3 c  White flour
    1/2 c  Warm water
    1/2 c  Soft lard
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 pk Dry yeast
      5 c  White flour
      1 c  Dried skim milk powder
    1/2 ts Ginger
 
  *Use Grated Raw Potato Starter
  
  Empty starter from glass jar into large mixing bowl (do not use metal
  or plastic).  Add 1-1/2 cups cold water and 1-1/2 cups white flour.
  Beat thoroughly. Cover tightly (clinging transparent wrap is good)
  and set in warm place (about 80) overnight.  Wash and scald starter
  jar and lid. Allow to air out overnight. In the morning stir the
  starter thoroughly. Pour off 2 cups and set aside. Pour remaining 2
  cups into glass jar, cover and return to refrigerator. Mix the 1/2
  cup warm water, 1 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1 pkg. yeast. Set
  in warm place until foaming nicely. Pour the 2 cups reserved starter
  into mixing bowl.  Add 1 cup dried skim milk. Beat the egg yolks (the
  more yolks the more tender and flaky the texture) in a measuring cup
  and add enough warm water to make 2 cups. Add to the starter mixture
  with 1/2 cups sugar and 3 cups white flour. Beat well. Add the dry
  yeast mixture as soon as it is ready and beat thoroughly. Add 1/2
  cups soft lard, 1-1/2 tsp. salt and 3 cups white flour. Stir until
  the dough clears the bowl. Spread the remaining 2 cups white flour on
  the pastry board. Turn out dough and knead thoroughly using a little
  more flour if necessary to make a smooth nonsticky but not to stiff
  dough. Return to the bowl. Grease top of dough, cover and set in warm
  place to rise. When light turn out dough and knead well. Divide into
  four even portions to make up in the following ways:  Old World Lemon
  Cookies, Grenadine Slices, Cardamom Rolls and Raisin Log.  (If
  fillings have been prepared ahead of time and the other ingredients
  needed set out while the dough is rising it will take only about 20
  minutes to get all of these made up and into the pans. If they are
  made in order listed they will be ready for oven at spaced intervals.)

      1 ts Cumin

    1/4 c  Peanut butter (no, really!)
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Olive oil
      2    Heads broccoli
 
  * or more, to taste Rinse the black beans, pick out any pebbles; then
  cover with water and let soak overnight. Then pour off the soaking
  water, add 1 bottle of stout, and add fresh water to cover the beans
  plus about 1". Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover
  partway (it will boil over if fully covered) and let cook for 1 1/2
  hours, stirring occasionally. Add water if neccessary.
  
  Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat.  Add the garlic, onions,
  and all chili peppers.  Saute a few minutes until soft, then add to
  the beans. Add the vinegar and spices and the diced tomatoes; simmer
  for another half hour, stirring.  As the liquid from the tomatoes
  boils off, start adding stout from the second bottle. About half of
  this bottle is reserved for the cook.
  
  Add the corn and the peanut butter, simmer for another hour or so,
  keeping it moist enough (with stout and/or water) so that it doesn't
  crust over. Stir occassionally.
  
  Best if you let it sit overnight, and reheat it for dinner the next
  day.
  
  To serve: cut the florets off of the broccoli, and steam until done
  (but crisp).  I ususally do this in the microwave. Serve the chili
  with a sprinkle of chopped onions and grated cheddar cheese on top
  (for vegan, omit cheese or use tofu cheese).  The broccoli can either
  be stirred in at the last minute, pressed on top of the chili for
  nice presentation, or placed along side it. Serve with spanish rice
  (follows) and with warmed corn tortillas!

  Oven method: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place skin side up in a
  shallow pan, baste with marinade, cover with foil and roast for 30
  minutes. Remove foil and brush with marinade again. Roast again
  uncovered for 20-30 minutes. (Test for doneness: drumsticks should be
  soft and juices should not be tinged with pink when you pierce the
  thickest part of the thigh with a fork. Brush with marinade twice
  more during this second roasting period.

      Title: FRAGRANT COCONUT & SPICE RICE
 Categories: Rice
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Peanuts, unsalted, shelled
           -and roughly chopped
      1 tb Dessicated coconut
      1 c  Coconut milk
      2 c  Water
      1    Lemon grass stem, 10 cm long
      8    Curry leaves
      2    Spring onions, cut in 2 mm
           -slices
      1 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
    1/2 ts Ground turmeric
  2 1/2 c  Long grain rice
 
  1. Heat oil in pan.  Add nuts, stir until golden; stir in coconut. 2.
  Add coconut milk and water to pan. Stir in lemon grass, curry leaves
  and spring onions. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer,
  uncovered, for 2 minutes. Add cumin, cardamom and turmeric, bring to
  a boil. Add rice, cook, uncovered, until steam holes appear at the
  surface. 3. Cover pan with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to very
  low. Cook for 10 minutes. Lift lid, check if rice is cooked, continue
  cooking if required. NOTE: Jasmine or Basmati rice can be used
  instead of long grain rice if preferred. Avoid lifting the lid of the
  pan while rice is cooking, as all the steam will escape, resulting in
  gluggy rice. HINT: The curry leaf is native to south east Asia and as
  its name suggests, lends a rich curry-like flavour to Asian dishes.

    175 g  Long-grain rice, cooked

  Simplicity itself, the aromatic spicing of turmeric and five-spice
  transforms rice both in colour and in flavour. The golden dish is
  finally garnished with browned pine nuts, which add their
  irresistible crunch to the soft rice.
  
  Simmer the spices in the oil for 2-3 minutes, then add to the drained
  rice and toss well. When well mixed together and heated through,
  season to taste, separate the grains with a fork and serve garnished
  with the browned pine nuts.

      Title: FRAGRANT HERBAL BEADS
 Categories: Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
    1/2 c  Herb leaves or flowers
           -- fresh or dried
           Water
           -- if using dried material
           All-purpose flour
     15 dr Essential oil
           -- to match or complement
           -- the herb
 
  Strip off leaves or petals and discard stems and other coarse or
  nonaromatic parts.  Puree fresh plant material in a food processor,
  blender, or old-fashioned meat grinder. A food processor breaks down
  herbs faster than any other method and can be used to finish blending
  the dough as well.  You can finely mince the herbs with a sharp knife
  instead, but the finished beads will be coarser than those made from
  a puree or powder. Process dried herb leaves or flower petals in a
  blender or spice mill, or rub the leaves across the bottom of a
  fine-mesh sieve until you have a fairly uniform powder.  Unless plant
  material is processed into a fine powder or smooth pulp, coarse beads
  will result.
  
  Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of flour to the plant material, and enough
  water, starting with 1 tablespoon (if using dried herbs), to make a
  smooth dough. These are approximate amounts; you'll need more flour
  if you're starting with a soupy puree, and more water if the herb
  powder is very dry. When blended, the dough should be the consistency
  of children's craft clay. If it seems too soft, add flour in small
  amounts to improve it; if too stiff, ad a little water; if too coarse
  or crumbly, try adding both flour and water until the dough is
  workable. Don't add essential oil yet; it evaporates too quickly
  during the blending.
  
  Pinch off bits of dough and roll them into beads between your palms,
  or roll a long "snake" (this always brings back memories of my
  childhood) and slice off uniform lengths, then shape them into beads.
  Work with a light touch and keep your hands clean to prevent the
  dough from sticking to them. Essential oil can be added at this
  point, or after the beads are dry. When sizing the beads, remember
  that they will shrink a bit as they dry.
  
  String the beads using a large darning needle and heavy carpet thread.
  Leave at least 6 inches of thread bare to allow room for sliding the
  beads as they dry. Tie a big knot or a button at the end to keep the
  beads from sliding off.
  
  Hang strings of beads to dry in a warm, airy place away from direct
  light and heat.  Drying take three to four days, depending on weather
  and bead size.  Slide the beads up and down the string periodically
  to keep them from sticking to the string or each other.  Store dried
  beads in an airtight container to preserve their scent until you're
  ready to assemble a necklace. String the beads with beading thread or
  dental floss for strength and durability.

      Title: FRAN'S POTATO/CHEESE/CORN CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups, Crockpot, Main dish
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      5 lb Potatoes
           -1 lb grated; 4 lbs diced
    3/4 c  Celery; diced
      1 c  Carrots; diced
      1 md Onion; minced
      2 lb Grated Cheese
      3 cn Creamed corn
      2 cn Whole corn (or frozen)
      1 lb Sliced sausage
      1 qt Chicken stock
      1 c  Powdered milk
           -NOT mixed up
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Seasoned salt
      2 ts Basil
 
  This recipe is an adaptation of several of the potatoe chowder
  recipes that Lawrence Kellie posted a while back. Some of the the
  ingredients also came from the top of my head. It turned out VERY
  well, though it does look a little odd.  My husband LOVES it.  I
  finally came up with my idea of what Corn/potato chowder should be.
  My 3-1/2 year old son's (vegetable hater) only comment as he shoveled
  it down was "yummy". I will definately be making this one again. I am
  glad I wrote the changes down this time, I usually don't.
  
  This can either be cooked as direced in the recipe, or for about 10
  hours in the crock pot, on HI, adding the milk powder and cheese at
  the end.
  
  In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat.   Saute onion and celery
  until softened but not brown. Add potatoes, Chicken broth, S&P, basil
  and carrots. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes
  until potatoes are just tender. Brown sliced sausage pieces in a fry
  pan, add to chowder.  Add cream of mushroom soup and corn. Simmer
  until potatoes and carrots are done to your desired level of
  mushiness ( I like em mushy in my chowder). Add grated cheese and
  milk powder. If the chowder is too thin, you can remove some of it
  and put throught the blender to thicken, if it is too thick, add
  water.  Adjust seasonings if desired. Serve with bread or crackers.

 Categories: Desserts, Low fat
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    230 g  (8 oz, 4 loosely packed
           Cups) fresh wholemal
           Breadcrumbs
    230 g  (8 oz, 2 cups) EACH of
           Roughly chopped muscatel
           (black) raisins,
           Sultanas (yellow raisins)
           And dried apricots
     60 g  (2 oz, 3/4 cup) crumbled
           Almond macaroons or
           Amaretti
     60 g  (2 oz, 3/4 cup) chopped
           Almonds
     60 g  (2 oz, 1/2 cup) ground or
           Flaked almonds
      1    Grated appple
      1 tb Grated orange zest
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Ground mace
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom (I had none,
           So used cumin, which worked
           As well!)
    1/2 ts Ground cloves (I used whole,
           And put them in the food
           Processor
           With the bread!  Again, it
           Worked)
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
      2 tb Orange marmalade or candied
           Orange peel
           Juice of 1 orange
      4 md Free-range eggs
      6 tb Or 1 miniature bottle of
           Cognac
    140 ml (5 fl oz, scant 2/3 cup)
           Fortified muscat wine, port,
           Marsala
           Or rich oloroso sherry
 
  Put all the dry ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Put
  the marmalade, orange juice, eggs, brandy and wine in another large
  bowl, or in the blender or food processor, and beat until well
  blended and frothy. Pour the liquid over the dry ingredients. Mix
  until moist. Cover, and let sand for a couple of hours at least and,
  if possible, overnight to let the spice flavours develop.
  
  Oil or butter the pudding basin and spoon in the mixture. As it
  contains no raw flour, it will not expand very much during the
  cooking, so you can fill the basin to within 1.25 cm (1/2 inch) of
  the rim. Take a square of greaseproof or waxed paper, oil or butter
  it (I didn't bother, but did oil the basins.  I don't have a 3-pint
  one, so used 1 2-pint and 1 1-pint one, 2 pints being ample for my
  family for Christmas dinner) and tie it over the top of the basin
  with string.
  
  Steam in boiling water for 5 hours.  Allow pudding to cool completely
  before wrapping it, still in its basin, in fresh greaseproof paper
  plus a layer of foil. Store in a cool dark place.
  
  On Christmas Day, steam for a further two hours.
  
  Bissell/Levy suggest serving this with creme fraiche, rather than the
  traditional brandy butter (don't ask - not to be discussed on THIS
  mailing list!!!), and I do think this is one occasion when a LITTLE
  cream is permissible!

      Title: FRANCES COOK'S BREAD & ROLLS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Milk
      1    Fresh cake yeast
    1/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Shortening
      1 ts Salt
      1    Egg
  3 1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Lukewarm water
 
  Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, & salt. Let it cool to
  lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water.
  When soft, add the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg
  mixture into the milk mixture and stir them together.
  The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large
  spoon, stir until flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm,
  but not stiff dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the
  dough with a plate or towel and set aside to rise until double in
  bulk (about 2 hrs depending on the temperature in the kitchen).
  Instead of letting the dough rise at this point you may put it in the
  refrigerator and use it later, or the next day. Watch to make sure it
  doesn't spill out of the bowl. If it starts to spill before you're
  ready to use it, punch it back down. Refrigerated dough is easier to
  handle but takes longer to rise.
  BREAD: If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the bowl onto
  a floured surface and with more flour as needed to keep it from
  sticking, knead it until springy and easy to handle. This dough does
  not require a lot of kneading; only enough to make it easy to handle.
  For 2 medium size loaves cut the dough in half and knead/shape each
  into loaves and put into greased baking pans. Allow about 2 hours for
  the dough to double again. Bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly
  browned on top (if uncertain whether or not bread is done, tip out of
  pan and see if bottom is browned too).
  ROLLS: To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily
  handled. Roll out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter
  and fold over and place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse
  rolls), or break dough into small pieces, make into little balls and
  place 3 in each section of a greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls).
  SWEET ROLLS: For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as for
  Parkerhouse rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a round.
  Spread it with raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Dot with
  butter and roll as for a jelly roll. Slice and place on a greased pan
  or make into a circle and make slashes through the dough at
  intervals. Let rise and bake as for loaves. Top with an icing made of
  confectioners' sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla or rum
  flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls while hot. Decorate
  with nuts or fruits.
  If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half white and half whole
  wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of white. The amounts above
  will yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of bread, or 2 dozen large
  rolls.

 Categories: Appetizers, Jewish, Potatoes, Side dishes
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 tb Shortening
      1 lg Onion -- diced
      2 lb Potatoes -- peeled
      3 tb Oil -- or chicken fat
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
 
  Cook potatoes in water.  In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, 1/2
  teaspoon salt and shortenng, blending with your fingers. Add 2/3 cup
  watr from the cooking potatoes. Knead lightly. Dough should be soft,
  but firm enough to roll. Add a bit more flour, if necessary. Smooth
  into a ball and cover bowl.
  
  Brown onion in oil.  Drain and mash potatoes and add onion. Add salt
  and pepper.  Roll 1/3 of the dough into a thin rectangle, about
  7"x14". Place a strip of potato mixture about 1 1/2" wide and high
  along the long edge. Roll like a jelly roll. Cut into 1 1/4" pieces.
  Take each piece and stretch the dough to cover the cut edges,
  unrolling slightly, if necessary. Knishes should be flat on the
  bottom and rounded on top. Don't worry if the dough tears of potato
  shows through. Repeat the process twice more with the remaining dough
  and potatoes.
  
  Place knishes on greased pans.  Bake 30 minutes at 400F, or until
  slightly browned.  If they are going to be frozen, bake only
  partially, and finish baking when ready to serve.

  *  Egg yolks must be beaten into the cake one at a time so keep the
  yolks
     seperated from each other.
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++++++ CAKE: To prepare cake, cream butter and sugar
  until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.  Beat in egg yolks, one
  at a time. Mix in lemon rind and 2 T rum.  Sift baking powder and
  flour together. Gently mix into the butter mixture.  Beat egg whites
  until stiff but not dry. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.

  degree F. oven for about 60 minutes or until the cake tests done.
  Cool cake in pan for 10 minutes adn then turn out on wire rack to
  cool completely. Slice cake crosswise into 3 layers. Pour about 2 T
  of rum over each layer. Butter-Cream Filling: For butter-cream
  filling, boil sugar and water to 238 degrees F. (soft ball stage).
  Beat egg yolks until very light and fluffy, 5 to 10 minutes. While
  still beating the egg yolks, add the sugar syrup in a thin stream.
  Beat 5 minutes more, until very thick and doupled in bulk.  Slowly
  beat in the rum.  Beat the butter in a small bowl until soft and
  light.  Beat butter into the egg mixture a little at a time. Continue
  beating until thick.  Chill until mixture can be spread. If mixture
  is too soft, beat in additional butter. PRALINE TOPPING: While
  butter-cream is cooking, spread 2 T butter thickly in a 9 X 13-inch
  baking pan for praline topping. Then in a 1-quart saucepan, boil
  sugar an water to 238 degrees F. (soft ball stage).  Stir in almonds;
  cook until mixture reaches 310 degrees F. or until syrup carmelizes.
  Pour syrup into prepared baking pan.  When cool, break up praline and
  grind it in a blender for a few seconds. APRICOT GLAZE: Finally heat
  jam and press through a strainer or sieve to make apricot glaze. CAKE

      Title: FRANGO MINT PIE
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      1 c  Butter
      2 c  Sugar, confectioner's
           -(sifted)
      4 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
      4    Eggs
    3/4 ts Peppermint extract
      2 ts Vanilla extract
     10    Vanilla wafers,
           -crushed
 
  Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
  
  In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate. Add to the
  butter-sugar mixture and beat thoroughly. Add the eggs one at a time,
  beating well after each egg, until well blended. Fold in the
  peppermint and vanilla.
  
  Line the pie tin with the vanilla wafer crumbs (buttering the pie tin
  makes them stick to the side a little better). Pour in the filling.
  Refrigerate for two hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Decadent chocolate mint pie -- One of the things that is memorable
  about Marshall Field's department store in Chicago is their "Frango
  chocolate mints." This pie captures the flavor perfectly. I got the
  recipe from Malcolm Slaney, who "found it in a cookbook when [he was]
  attending Kayak School in Oregon."
  
  *  This recipe fills a shallow 8 inch pie tin; add 50 percent to
  everything to fill a 9-inch pie tin.
  
  *  If you're not very good at pie crusts (I'm not), feel free to use a
  pre-formed graham cracker crust. The chocolate and mint flavors
  predominate, no matter what crust you use.
  
  *  This is serious decadence! The first time I made this, I stopped
  several times in disbelief of just what I was doing. Enjoy!
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (melting chocolate is tricky).
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: FRANK KHACHI'S MIND-ALTERING ICE CREAM SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Desserts, Weird
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter
      2 c  Seedless green grapes
           - split in halves
      2    Hot chiles; minced
           -habaneros, jalapenos or
           -serranos
      3 tb Rum
      1 tb Honey
    1/4 ts Vanilla
      1 ds Ground nutmeg
      1 ds Ground cinnamon
 
  Melt butter in small omelet pan.  Add grapes and saute 3 minutes. Add
  minced chiles and rum.  Saute l more minute, then flambe by carefully
  tilting pan into gas flame until pan flames up or by holding match
  over evaporating alcohol. When flames subside, add honey, vanilla,
  nutmeg and cinnamon.  Cook 3 minutes more, stirring frequently. Makes
  about l l/3 cups, 4 servings. From the article in the LA Times,
  issued 6/28/92, comes this comment on this recipe: "Chef Frank Khachi
  concocted grape-habanero topping to serve over a handmade pineapple
  parfait, but it's great served over plain ice creams such as
  chocolate, vanilla or strawberry. Add the sauce to the ice cream just
  before serving. Chiles vary widely in their level of heat, but they
  become milder as they are cooked. If you're cooking for total
  sissies, try this with only one pepper. If you already have a serious
  pepper habit, better increase the dosage to three or four".

      Title: FRANK'S CLASSIC CHICKEN CACCIATORE
 Categories: Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ea Chicken, skinned & cut into
           Pieces
      4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
      6 ea Garlic cloves, peeled
      2 c  Chicken stock
      1 lg Onion, diced
    1/2 md Bell pepper, diced
    1/2 lb Mushroom buttons, quartered
     10 ea Anchovy fillets, chopped
  1 1/2 c  Dry red wine or dry sherry
      4 tb Red wine vinegar
      2 ts Rosemary
      6 ea Sprigs fresh basil -or-
      1 ts Dry basil
    1/2 ts Italian seasoning
      1 cn Tomato paste
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
     First, in a heavy Dutch oven (preferably cast-iron) heat the olive
  oil and saute the chicken and garlic until lightly browned...(but
  remember to stir everything constantly so that the garlic doesn't
  burn!). Then remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside
  momentarily.
     Next, take half of the chicken stock, add it to the Dutch oven
  over high heat, and de-glaze the pot. When all the residue is scraped
  off the bottom and the stock is reduced by one-half its volume, stir
  in the onions, bell pepper, and mushrooms and cook them until wilted
  (about 5 minutes).
     Now place the chicken back in the pot, add the chopped anchovies,
  wine, wine vinegar, rosemary, basil, and Italian seasonings, and stir
  everything together gently.
     At this point, dissolve the tomato paste in the chicken stock you
  have left and pour it evenly over the ingredients in the pot. Then
  cover the Dutch oven tightly, reduce the heat to low, and simmer
  gently for about 15 minutes.
     Finally, taste the sauce, add the amount of salt and pepper you
  desire, cover the pot again and continue simmering on low for another
  45 minutes to 1 hour (or until the chicken is tender).
  
  HINTS: 1 - Do not leave out the anchovies! Even if you don't like
  anchovies put 'em in! I promise you won't taste them, but you lose
  the unique flavor the dish if you eliminate them.
   2 - I suggest you serve the cacciatore piping hot over fettucine
  noodles topped with grated Romano cheese, garlic bread, and a chilled
  glass of wine.
   3 - Once the chicken begins to cook, be sure to stir the pot gently
  or you'll break the meat off the bone.
   4 - You can make a variety of other cacciatores using this recipe by
  simply substituting other meats for the chicken - for example, turkey,
  veal, beef, pork, venison, squirrel, and rabbit all work well.
  Remember cacciatore means "hunter's stew."

      Title: FRANK'S EGGPLANT SICILIANO
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
      1 qt Marinara sauce
      1 lg Eggplant, peeled & sliced
      1 lb Italian sausage, pan sauteed
      1 lb Mozzarella cheese
      2 c  Grated Romano cheese
      1 ts Garlic powder
      4 ts Basil leaves
      2 ts Oregano
           Black pepper to taste
 
     First, take a 10 x 14 glass baking pan and coat the sides and
  bottom with the olive oil. Then pour a cup of the marinara sauce into
  the pan and spread it out evenly.
     Next, place a layer of the sliced eggplant in the pan (making sure
  to work it into the sauce). Then spread on another half-cup or so of
  sauce to cover the eggplant. Now SPRINKLE on some Italian sausage ...
  then some mozzarella...then some Romano...then some garlic
  powder...then some basil...then some oregano. Just try to get the
  SPRINKLINGS as evenly distributed as possible.
     At this point, ladle on another cup of the sauce, spread it
  around, and cover it with another layer of eggplant. Now repeat the
  entire process over and over again until all the ingredients are
  used, and top off the dish with a heavy layer of mozzarella.
     Now, preheat your oven to 350 degrees, season to taste with the
  black pepper, and cover the dish TIGHTLY with heavy-duty aluminum
  foil. All that's left is to bake it in the upper third of your oven
  for about an hour (or until the eggplant is soft and tender), then
  cool for about 20 minutes before serving.

      Title: FRANK'S MARINARA SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
      6    Garlic cloves, baked and
           Pureed
      2 cn Italian peeled tomatoes
           (303 size)
      1 cn Tomato paste (6 oz size)
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
      6 ea Anchovy fillets
      2 ts Sweet basil
    1/2 ts Oregano
      1 ea Lemon peel strip
      2 ts Black pepper
 
     To bake garlic, first, cut the tops off the garlic heads and place
  them into a shallow baking pan with the cut sides up. (I normally
  bake several heads at once, they don't last long around here!) Then
  pour olive oil over the garlic, cover the pan with aluminum foil, and
  bake at 400 degrees for 1 hour. When the heads are cooked (they will
  become soft and mellow), set them aside and let them cool to room
  temperature.
     Puree 6 cloves of garlic and the anchovies together. In a 5-quart
  Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and gently blend in the pureed garlic
  until smooth. Then add both the peeled tomatoes and the tomato paste,
  along with the onions, and cook over medium heat until the mixture
  begins to reduce and thicken.
     Now, add the sweet basil, oregano, and lemon peel and stir
  everything together well. Then cover the pot, reduce the heat to low,
  and simmer for about 45 minutes.
     At this point, add the black pepper and season the sauce with salt
  to taste (it may not need any, depending upon the saltiness of the
  anchovies). Then cover and simmer for another 15 minutes.

           -sliced
    1/2 c  Parsley finely chopped
      5 c  Milk - scalded
      2 tb Butter - (1 ounce)
 
  First, take a 4-quart casserole dish and butter the bottom and sides.
  Then mix together well the flour, salt and black pepper, and preheat
  your oven to 350F degrees. Next, take one-third of the Potatoes and
  make a layer on the bottom of the casserole dish.  Then sprinkle the
  slices gently with one-third of the flour mixture. Then sprinkle on
  one-third of the onions, green onions and parsley.  [I'd mix these
  together well and then separate into thirds.] Repeat this process
  until you "layer on" all the Potatoes, flour, onions, green onions
  and parsley. Now, scald the milk and melt the butter into it. And
  when thoroughly blended, gently pour the mixture uniformly over the
  layer Potatoes. At this point, cover the casserole with tight-fitting
  aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Then uncover the dish and bake
  for another hour (or until the Potatoes are browned and tender).
  Serve 'em piping hot! And you'd better have enough for seconds!

  yolks seperated from each other.
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++ ++++ CAKE: To prepare cake, cream butter and sugar
  until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in egg yolks, one
  at a time. Mix in lemon rind and 2 T rum.  Sift baking powder and
  flour together. Gently mix into the butter mixture.  Beat egg whites
  until stiff but not dry. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.

  degree F. oven for about 60 minutes or until the cake tests done.

      Title: FRANKFURTER BUNS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Lard
      3 ts Salt
      2 pk Active Dry Yeast
      1 ts Sugar
      1 c  ;Warm Water, (115 Deg. F.)
 10 1/2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
      2 lg Eggs
 
  Scald the milk in a 1-quart saucepan, over medium heat. Meanwhile
  combine the sugar, lard and salt in a large mixing bowl and set
  aside. Pour the milk over the sugar mixture and cool to lukewarm.
  Sprinkle the yeast and 1 ts of sugar over the lukewarm water,
  stirring to dissolve. Let stand for 10 minutes to proof, (become
  foamy). Add the yeast mixture, 5 c of the flour, and the eggs to the
  milk mixture. Beat for 2 minutes, using an electric mixer set to
  Medium speed. Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
  a soft dough. NOTE: The dough should be light and slightly sticky and
  not heavy. This is very important because if you have to much flour
  in the dough, the bread will not rise correctly. Turn the dough out
  and let rest while you wash, dry and lightly grease the mixing bowl.
  Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and satiny,
  about 8 to 10 minutes.  Place the dough in the prepared bowl, turning
  once to grease the top of the dough.  Cover and let rise in a warm
  place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down and divide
  into fourths. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Roll each fourth
  into a 9 X 4-inch rectangle. Cut into 9 (4 X 1-inch) strips. Roll
  each strip to form a 5 1/2-inch cylinder. Place on greased baking
  sheets, about 3-inches apart, and flatten slightly with the palm of
  your hand. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake
  in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven for 18 minutes or until golden
  brown. Remove from the baking sheets and cool on racks. When cold to
  the touch, wrap in foil until ready to use.

      Title: FRANKFURTER GRUENE SAUCE (FRANKFURT GREEN SAU
 Categories: Sauces, German, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      3 c  Mixed herbs (parsley,
           -chives, chervil, borage,
           -dill,
           Spinach greens, watercress,
           -tarragon, basil,
           Pimpernel)
      1 c  Sour cream or plain yogurt
      2 sm Onions. coarsely chopped
      2 tb Cream
      2 tb Mayonnaise
    3/4 c  Low-fat cottage cheese
           -(pressed through a fine
           -sieve
           In order to smooth curds)
           Ground white pepper
           Small pinch of sugar
      1    To 2 eggs, hardboiled and
           -coarsely chopped
 
  Choose all or merely a selection of the herbs and greens mentioned in
  the list of ingredients (using the tarragon more sparingly than the
  others.) Wash them thoroughly and drain on paper towels. Coarsely
  chop the greens; loosely packed, they should amount to about 3 cups
  altogether. Take 2 cups of the greens, combine with the sour cream or
  yogurt and the onions, and puree in the blender or processor; add a
  few tablespoons of cream if it doesn't seem to be fluid enough. The
  rest of the greens should just be finely chopped and stirred in a
  mixing bowl with the puree in order to give the sauce a little bite.
  Stir in as much mayonnaise and low-fat cottage cheese as it takes to
  produce a smooth, creamy sauce.
  
  Season with salt, pepper, and a very little sugar. The hardboiled
  eggs can either be mixed in with the sauce or strewn over it as a
  garnish.
  
  Makes 2 - 3 cups.

      1 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Baking powder
      2 tb Brown sugar
      2 tb Lard
    2/3 c  Water
 
  Mix together dry ingredients; cut in lard with a pastry blender until
  mixture resembles fine crumbs. Sprikle water over pastry, a little at
  a time, stirring with a fork until mixture forms a soft dough. Turn
  dough out onto a light floured board. Knead about 10 times. Roll out
  to 1/2 inch thick circle; place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at
  450 for 10-15 minutes until golden. Cut in wedges and serve hot with
  butter.
  
  ** This is the city slicker method, now on to the "native" method,
  the one that native Indians used long before the white man came to
  the Caribou.*
  
  Same ingredients.  Put in bowl and mix with hands until thoroughly
  combined. Work with dough until it feels soft and satiny, about 3-5
  minutes.  Take handful of dough and pat between palms until you get a
  saucer sized form. Wrap around sturdy stick and cook over open camp
  fire until golden brown. Can be eaten alone, broken in pieces and
  buttered and jammed, or if you want to get fancy, stuff with cooked
  ground beef mixture. The best way to eat it is at night when the kids
  have gone to bed, and you are sitting around the campfire swapping
  horror stories. Eat it plain, it is fantastic.

  3 1/2 c  Tomatoes
     16 oz Tomato sauce
      1 lg Onion, diced
      1    Garlic clove, minced
  1 1/2 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Rosemary leaves

      Title: FRED'S MUSKRAT
 Categories: Game
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Muskrats (all fat
           -and glands removed)
    1/2 lb Bacon
    1/2    Celery bunch, chopped
      4    Onions, chopped
    1/2 lb Oleo
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
           Salt
           Pepper
     21 oz Tomato soup
           -(2 standard cans)
 
  Saute bacon, celery, onions, oleo and cayenne pepper together for 10
  minutes.
  
  Put rats in bottom of a pan you can cover tightly (my mother makes a
  double batch and uses the roaster she cooks turkey in). Pour sauteed
  mixture over the rats, and then cover with tomato soup. (Don't add
  water to the soup.)
  
  Bake, covered, for 2 1/2 hours at 350 degrees F or until done.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Muskrat roasted in tomato sauce -- In northwestern Ohio and
  downriver Detroit, we have "muskrat suppers" in the winter, sponsored
  by churches and volunteer fire departments to raise money, rather the
  way other people have chicken and ham dinners.  This recipe comes
  from Fred Witty, via the cookbook put out by my parents' church.
  
  Legend has it that during the depression, the Bishop of Detroit
  declared muskrats to be fish (since they live in the water), so they
  could be eaten by Catholics on Fridays.
  
  *  Muskrats are small rodents that live in swamp and build beaver-like
  houses out of cat-tails and mud. In New Jersey and Ohio, at least,
  they are trapped for their fur; I suspect that knowing a trapper is
  the only way you can get muskrats.
  
  *  The recipe book I have has a recipe for muskrats for a crowd, that
  (for 20 rats) uses the above ingredients (but quantities unspecified,
  except it only uses about 1/4 lb oleo), plus chopped green and red
  peppers, garlic salt, 5 bouillon cubes and 3 bay leaves. Around
  Detroit, muskrats are cooked with cabbage and potatoes, and some
  folks at home roast them with apples and onions.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy once you have the muskrats.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  count the muskrats.

 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
  :          Dough:
      1/4 c  granulated sugar
        1 c  flour
      1/4 ts salt
      1/8 ts baking powder
        8 TB unsalted butter, cut into
  :          tblp pieces, -- very cold
        1    egg mixed with 1 teaspoon
  :          water
  
  In a food processor, combine the sugar, flour, salt, baking powder.
  When well combined, add the butter and pulse the machine until the
  butter is broken up into the flour mixture. Add the egg and water and
  process until the dough forms a dough.
  
  Transfer the dough into waxed paper; pat it (with floured hands if
  need be) into a flat round and refrigerate for 30 to 45 minutes or
  until it has relaxed and you can roll it out.
  
  Divide the dough into approximately 8 equal pieces. On a lightly
  floured board roll out the pieces until slightly thicker than
  1/8th-inch thick. Rather than bother fitting them into tartlet shells
  and prebaking them, simply shape them into rough rounds (3 inches or
  3 1/2 inches round) or cut them into hearts or rectangles. Transfer
  the free form shapes to a baking sheet and chill 20 minutes while you
  preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Scraps can be shaped into smaller
  cookies.
  
  Prick the dough with a fork (just as you would the bottom dough of a
  tartlet shell) so the dough doesn't puff up. Bake for 10 to 12
  minutes or until edges are brown. Remove them from the oven to a rack
  and let them cool. When completely cool top with whatever you like.
  
  Yield: dough for 8 free-form tarts

      2 cn Black beans
      2    3 cups of cooked rice (your
           Favorite kind)
      1 lg Onion
      3    To 4 cloves garlic

           Powder, cayenne pepper
      1 pk Flour tortillas, burrito
           Size
      1 sm Can tomato sauce
 
  Saute onions and garlic in your favorite oil sub (I like to use
  balsamic vinegar or cooking sherry).  When onion is soft, add spices
  (sorry no measurements, I just throw on what looks good), cook a
  couple of more minutes and remove from heat. In a large bowl, dump 1
  can of beans with juice, drain the other can and then add the beans
  to the bowl. Add the can of tomato sauce. Mash the beans until most
  are mashed, but leave some unmashed.  Add cooked rice and onion
  mixture. Stir well. Roll up burritos, freeze.  These make good
  snacks, lunch or supper with a salad, and I love them for breakfast.
  Enjoy!

  I make brown and serve rolls all the time just let rise and bake 20
  minutes at 250 DO NOT brown rolls let cool they will be slightly
  tacky on top take out of pan let cool compeletly on a rack they will
  keep up to 7 days in the fridge and 3 months in the freezer. wrap in
  foil put in plastic bag. to bake let thaw at room temp then bake for
  8 minutes at 350 till golden brown. This is a great way to make stuuf
  ahead when having Easter, Thanksgiving or Christmas or any other
  large dinner. I made cinnamon rolls the other day and just let the
  machine (DAK TurboII) do the manual cycle and when done I rolled them
  out and sliced them as usual and put them into 9" pie pans. I froze
  them without letting them rise any further. Before I went to bed one
  night I took a pan out of the freezer and put on the counter. When I
  got up the next morning I popped them in the oven. They were just as
  good as if I had done it the normal way. I would think dinner rolls
  would work the same if you had time to let them thaw. The other reply
  about making them into "brown and serve" rolls sounds good, too.

      Title: FREEZING HERBS
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  The best guide I've seen to freezing, drying, canning, and otherwise
  preserving all manner of foods is _Stocking Up_ by Carol Hupping:
  
  In it is excellent advice on freezing fresh herbs for later use.
  
  Basically, you should blanch the herbs for a few seconds before
  freezing.
  
  The Rodale Food Center did some testing, comparing herbs blanched
  before freezing and those not.  Here were some of the results:
  
  BASIL: Basil frozen raw darkened to a drab grayish-green and turned
  somewhat bitter, losing much of its lovely aroma. But when it was
  blanched in water before freezing, it stayed green (although darker
  than when fresh) and was flavorful and aromatic. Surprisingly, steam
  blanching was not as successful.
  
  DILL: The blanched sample was far superior to the raw, frozen one: It
  was more tender, brighter green, and more flavorful. Instructions for
  freezing fresh herbs are to:
  
  1. Wash if visibly dirty 2. Hold by stems with tongs and dip into
  boiling water briefly, swishing around. Remove when color brightens.
  3. Cool by holding under cold running water and blotting dry with
  towls or let them air cool. 4. Remove stems and either leave whole or
  chop 5. Lay out flat on waxed paper, roll up or fold paper if you
  have a small freezer. You want to freeze the herbs so they are not
  touching each other. 6. Freeze.
  
  Can be used frozen or thawed in frige for a week.
  
  Alternatively, you can freeze herbs into ice cubes. Remove stems and
  chop, place in trays, cover with water, and freeze. You can use
  pre-blanched herbs or just pour boiling water into the trays over the
  herbs. These herbed cubes can be used later when you are preparing
  stoups, just throw a frozen cube or two into the soup.
  
  The book says that while frozen herbs won't taste or look quite like
  fresh ones, most will come very close.

      Title: FRENCH APPLE CHARLOTTE
 Categories: Desserts, French
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     10    To 12 apples
    3/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Unsalted butter
     12 sl Bread, crusts removed
 
  This takes a while to prepare, but it isn't difficult and it has a
  most distinctive and delicious flavor. (A charlotte mold is round a
  3-1/4 -4 inches high, but a 2 quart souffle dish will do as well.)
  
  Peel and core apples and cut them into thin slices. Melt the sugar
  and 5 tbsp of the butter in a large frying pan. Add apples, stir
  until coated with butter, cover and cook over low heat until tender.
  Uncover and continue to simmer until water formed is evaporated. You
  should now have a thick apple puree. Cut bread into pieces and
  completely cover the bottom and sides of the mold. (easy when bread
  is cut into 1 inch strips for sides, and triangles for the bottom.)
  Then brown the triangle pieces in some of the butter and place in
  bottom of mold. Dip strips of bread in melted butter and line sides.
  Pour hot puree into mold and cover with more trips of bread dipped in
  melted butter. Set the mold on a baking sheet and place in a 400 F
  oven.  Bake 40-50 minutes, or until bread on top is a deep golden
  brown.  Remove from oven and let stand 20 minutes. Slip a knife
  between mold and bread and turn on to a platter. Serve hot with cream
  or apricot rum sauce. (1/2 cup apricot jam warmed up with 1/4 cup
  rum.) Serves 8.

 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Milk
      3    Egg yolks
      1 tb Butter or margarine
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 lb Tart cooking apples
      1 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      2 tb Sugar
           Dash of nutmeg
    3/4 c  Apricot preserves
      1    Egg yolk
 
  Prepare crust and roll out 2/3rds of the pastry to form a 12 inch
  circle. Use to line a 9 inch pie plate; refrigerate with rest of
  pastry. Make filling: In small saucepan combine 1/3 cup sugar and the
  flour; mix well. Stir in milk.  Bring to boiling, stirring; reduce
  heat; simmer, stirring until slightly thickened ~ 1 minute. In a
  small bowl, beat 3 egg yolks slightly.  Beat in a little of hot
  mixture; pour back into saucepan, beating to mix well.  Stir in 1
  tablespoon butter and the vanilla. Turn into bowl to cool. Core,
  pare, and slice apples; sprinkle with lemon juice. In medium skillet,
  heat butter with sugar and nutmeg. Add apple slices; saute, stirring
  occasionally, until partially cooked - about 5 minutes. Remove from
  heat.  Heat apricot preserves just until melted. Preheat oven to
  425F. Turn filling into pie shell, spreading evenly. Arrange apple
  slices on top, mounding slightly in center. Spread with apricot
  preserves. Roll out rest of pastry to form a 10-inch circle. With
  knife or pastry wheel, cut into 12 strips 1/2" wide. Slightly moisten
  rim of pie shell with cold water.  Arrange 6 stips across filling;
  press ends to rim of pie shell, trimming off ends if necessary.
  Arrange rest of strips at right angle to first strips, to form a
  lattice. Bring overhang of pastry up over ends of strips; crimp edge.
  Mix yolk with a tablespoon of water; use to brush lattice strips, not
  edge. On lowest shelf of oven, bake 35-40 minutes, or until pastry is
  golden. Cool. Serve slightly warm.

      Title: FRENCH APPLE TART
 Categories: Desserts, French, Pies, Fruits, Kump
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    (9-in) pre-cooked tart shell
      2 lb Apples
           -preferably Golden Delicious
    1/2    Lemon, juiced
      2 tb Sugar (or more if needed)
    3/4 c  Apricot jam
    1/4 c  Calvados
           -=OR=- Dark Rum or Cognac
      2 tb Butter
 
  PEEL, QUARTER and core the apples. Slice 3 apples into thin slices,
  toss with lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the sugar and set aside.
  Make applesauce with the rest of the apples: Chop coarsely, place in
  a saucepan with 2-3 tablespoons of water, cover and cook over a
  medium-low heat until very soft. Warm the jam, then force it through
  a sieve (fruit bits can be returned to the jar). Add 1/4 cup of
  strained jam to applesauce, together with the Calvados and butter.
  Continue cooking, if needed, until fairly thick. Taste and add sugar
  if needed. It should taste sweet, but not like jam. Spread the
  applesauce over the tart shell, then layer the drained apple slices
  in concentric circles over it. Bake about 30 minutes, until the
  apples are tender. Warm remaining apricot jam, adding a tablespoon or
  so of water if needed, to paint over the tart. Best served warm.

      Title: FRENCH APRICOT CREAM CHEESE BARS
 Categories: Dessert, Cookies, Bars, Suzy, Tried
      Yield: 24 Bars
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      1 pk French Vanilla Cake Mix
    1/3 c  Unsalted butter or margarine
      1 lg Egg

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      8 oz Pkg. cream cheese,softened
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 lg Egg
     12 oz Jar apricot preserves*
 
  * I used Bing Cherry Preserves and they were delicious.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease 13x9-inch pan. In a
  large bowl, combine cake mix, butter and egg; Mix only until crumbly.
  Gently spoon 1 1/2 cup of the crumbled mixture into a mixing cup; set
  aside for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture on the bottom of the
  greased pan.
  
  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 10 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, in a smaller mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar,
  vanilla and egg; beat until smooth. Set aside.
  
  Spread preserves evenly over hot crust. Then spread cream cheese
  mixture evenly over preserves.
  
  Sprinkle reserved topping mixture over cream cheese.
  
  Bake at 350 degrees F. for an additional 30 minutes or until topping
  is light golden brown. Cool to room temperature, then chill until
  serving. Store in refrigerator.
  
  Note: The dough must be crumbly. I had to add a bit more flour to the
  reserved 1 1/2 cups to get the proper consistency as I mixed it
  beyond the crumbly stage and a smooth dough started to form. You
  don't want  balls of dough, but lumpy CRUMBS!
