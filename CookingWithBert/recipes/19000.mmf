      Title: CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP (LIE)
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Mushrooms,rinsed & drained
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      1    Large onion,chopped
    1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      6 c  Chicken broth,reg-strength
      1    Dried bay leaf
      1 c  Whipping cream
      3 tb Dry sherry
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Mushroom soup is so readily available in cans that it seldom occurs
  to the cook to make it from scratch. The canned product is, in fact,
  so universal, reliable, and chameleon-like in flavor that it has
  become the base of a thousand casseroles.
  If you seek a more intense mushroom flavor, however, look no further.
  Erid Lie, tooting his own horn, claims to have the answer to your
  prayers right here.
  Flour plays a part in the thickening of this soup, but the basic body
  and emphatic statement of mushroom flavor come from cooking part of
  the mushrooms with onions until they are mellow and lightly browned,
  then pureeing them.
  The flavor is further enhanced by adding sliced mushrooms before the
  final heating.
  =======================================================
  ============== ===
  1. Chop half the mushrooms; thinly slice the remaining mushrooms and
  set aside.
  2. Melt butter in a 5-6 quart pan over medium-high heat; add chopped
  mushrooms, onion, and thyme. Stir often until the vegetables are
  lightly browned, 15-20 minutes. Mix flour with vegetables.
  3. Pour into a blender or food processor; whirl, adding as much broth
  as needed to get the mixture smoothly pureed. Pour mixture back into
  pan; add remaining broth, sliced mushrooms, bay leaf, and cream.
  4. Bring soup to a boil on high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce
  heat to low and simmer to blend flavors, about 10 minutes. Add
  sherry, salt, and pepper to taste. Make about 8 cups.

      Title: CREAM OF RICE CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 95 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Cream of rice, regular or
           Quick cooking
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    2/3 c  Milk
 
  "If you have a food mill, make your own cream of rice by grinding
  whole rice to a medium coarsness. The difference in taste between
  this and the commercial cereals is as marked as that between ordinary
  and freshly ground coffee.
  
  325~ F      20 to 25 minutes
  
  Preheat the oven to 325~ F.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the cream of rice,
  flour, sugar, and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal. Slowly blend in enough of the milk to form a dough that
  will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. With a sharp
  knife, cut the dough into 2-inch shapes.
  
  Place the crackers on an ungreased baking sheet and prick each one
  all the way through in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake
  for 20 to 25 minutes, or until light golden brown. Cool on a rack.
  Yield: 85-95.
  
  VARIATIONS: Substituting half-and-half or cream for the milk will
  result in a richer cracker.
  
  For a different taste, substitute cream of wheat or cream of rye
  cereals for the cream of rice.

  Finalist in 1986 Recipe Contest: PATTY FILICE, Gilroy, CA
  
  Some of the best garlic recipes come right from Gilroy. Here's one-a
  rich, filling soup that would go well with a light seafood or poultry
  entree.
  
  Place garlic heads on cookie sheet, sprinkle with olive oil and bake
  in 350-degree oven for 1 hour. Let cool. Cut off end of each clove
  and squeeze out contents. (Garlic will be soft and creamy.) Set
  aside. Saute chopped onion in butter until softened. Add buttermilk
  and cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour mixture into a food
  processor. Rice potato and add with garlic to onion and buttermilk
  mixture. Puree until smooth. Return mixture to saute pan. Add cognac,
  dill and salt. Heat thoroughly. If soup is too thin, add additional
  potato. If soup is too thick, add addi- tional buttermilk. Serve
  immediately, garnished with additional dill and croutons. Makes 4
  servings.

      Title: CREAM OF SALSIFY & MUSHROOM SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    450 g  Salsify ( 1 lb)
      2    Onions, chopped
      3 tb Sunflower oil
    275 g  Mushrooms (9 2/3 oz),
           -- cleaned and roughly
           -- chopped
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 l  Water (2 1/8 pints)
     25 g  Butter (1 oz)
     25 g  Flour (1 oz)
  1 1/2 dl Milk (1/4 pint)
           Sea salt
           Black pepper, freshly ground
 
  Scrub the salsify in plenty of water, discard the ends of the roots
  and cut into 1 cm (1/2 in) lengths. Soften the onions with the
  salsify in the sunflower oil for 10 ... 15 minutes in a heavy,
  covered pan. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking, as salsify is
  dry. Meanwhile stew the mushrooms in the olive oil until they have
  given off their liquid, reserve the liquid and add the mushrooms to
  the salsify and onions. Cover with the water and bring to the boil;
  simmer for 20 minutes. In a heavy pan, melt the butter, stir in the
  flour and gradually add first the mushrooms-liquid, then the milk.
  When you have a thick sauce, slowly stir in the liquid from the soup,
  add the vegetables and liquidize. Season with salt and pepper to
  taste. (Salsify is a long, thin, darkly earth-coloured root, can be
  found in greengrocers's shops in February, also available as
  preserved ; when scrubbed, it is revealed to be white whithout an
  obvious outer skin. Also known as "vegetable oysters" ~ some
  curiously salt, fishy flavour - or as "poor people's asparagus")

  stock. If it is to be served cold, stir in the cream and chill. If it
  is to be served hot, bring the cream to the boil in a clean pan and
  add the soup gradually. In both cases serve sprinkled with chives or
  better, chopped basil. If you like a spicy flavour, add nutmeg to the
  soup as it cooks and sprinkle a little on top when it is served.
  
  Modifications for sterilising

  jars, and seal and sterilise in the usual way. When reheating, season
  then bring 200ml cream to the boil and pour in the boiling soup
  gradually. You may have to reblend to cure possible curdling.

  (cool) for about 2 minutes. Add eggs one at a time and beat one
  minute after each addition. Then beat on medium speed for 3 minutes
  to incorporate air into mixture. Refrigerate the dough covered for
  one hour. It should be good and cold. Preheat the oven for 15 or more
  minutes to 450F Use parchment paper on jelly roll pan and ice cream
  scoop to get nice size puffs on sheet. Six puffs is probably all it
  will hold. Bake at 450F for 15 minutes and then reduce heat to 350F
  and bake for 30 minutes. DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR during this period. As
  soon as the final 30 minutes is up. Turn the oven off and open the

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
  1 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
      6    Eggs
 
  1.  Preheat oven to 400F. 2. Put the water and butter in a medium
  saucepan, and set over medium-
    high heat.  Adjust the heat so that the butter is melted about the
    same time as the water begins to boil.  Off the heat, add the flour
    all at once and stir until blended.  Over medium-high heat, beat
    the mixture until it forms a mass around the spoon and a film begins
    to form on the bottom and sides of the pan.  This indicates the
    flour is cooked. 3. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after
  each addition.  You
    can use an electric mixer for this.  The batter should be shiny
    and fall slightly from a spoon when lifted. 4. Using a pastry bag
  fitted with a 1/2" plain tip (or a spoon), form
    3 to 4 inch mounds of dough on a greased cookie sheet, leaving 2
    inches between each.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Lower the oven to 350F
    and bake another 10 minutes, or until the puffs are browned and dry
    looking.  Let cool on the sheet. 5. When cool, cut the tops off the
  puffs and carefully pull out any
    uncooked parts from the inside.  Place tops back on the cream puffs.
    At this point, the puffs can be used immediately or frozen for later
    use. ~--

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     12 oz Red bell peppers -- roasted
    3/4 c  Sour cream
      2 tb Dry white wine
           Salt and pepper
           Red bell peppers -- strips
 
  Roast your own peppers or purchase a 10 ounce jar. Drain the peppers.
  Use food processor to puree. In a small saucepan heat the peppers over
  medium-low heat for about 2 minutes or till bubbly. Gradually whisk
  in the sour cream, wine, salt and ground pepper. Heat through but do
  not boil.
  
  Important!  Heat individual plates.  Spoon hot sauce over hot, drained
  pasta and garnish with fresh bell pepper slivers (optional). Eat
  immediately.
  
  Variation from Soup Plantation Restaurants--  Use V8 instead of wine.
  Offer with radiatore, twists, 'little helmets' or spinach fettuccine
  or linguine
  
  This is a last-minute sauce that needs to be eaten hot. Sauce for
  pasta but can be used on chicken or vegetables like cauliflower. The
  richness may be too-too for some tastes. Also offer bread.

      1 c  Heavy (whipping) cream
      1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
 
  Preheat oven to 350'F.
  
  Spray a shallow baking dish - such as a pie pan - with non-stick
  baking spray. Spread the sliced cabbage around in the dish as evenly
  as possible. Scatter sugar, salt and nutmeg over the cabbage and pour
  in the cream.
  
  Top with bread crumbs in as even a layer as you can make it. Bake at
  350'F. for 45 minutes.
  
  NOTE: This is a very flexible dish. It can bake for an hour at 325'F.
  or a half-hour at 375'F., so it can go into the oven with something
  else. You may also substitute evaporated skimmed milk for the heavy
  cream if butterfat is a concern for you, although the dish will not
  be quite as pleasing in that case.

  Otherwise, thin it    with your choice of cream, milk, water, chicken
  broth or whatever
     flavor you like.  Add onions and bake at 325 to 350 until bubbly.

MMMMM--------------------------CROUTONS-------------------------------
      6 sl Bread; cubed 1/2"
    1/4 c  Butter, unsalted
      1    Garlic clove; minced

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
     10 oz Spinach, frozen; cooked
      1 tb Butter, unsalted; softened
      3 tb Cream, heavy
    1/2 c  Parmesan; grated
      1 tb Butter, unsalted; softened
      1 tb Parmesan; grated
 
                                         Approx. Cook Time: 1:00
  
  Sponge:  Separate the eggs, and bring the whites to room temperature.
  In a saucepan melt the butter over low heat, stir in the flour, and
  cook the roux, stirring, for 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat
  and add the milk, heated, in a stream, whisking. Simmer the mixture,
  whisking occasionally, for five minutes, add the nutmeg and salt and
  pepper to taste, and transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Whisk in
  the egg yolks, one at a time, whisking well after each addition, and
  whisk in the Parmesan.  In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg
  whites with a pinch of salt until they are frothy, add the cream of
  tartar, and beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Stir
  one third of the whites into the mixture and fold in the remaining
  whites gently but thoroughly.
  
  Spread the sponge batter evenly in a buttered 15-1/2"x10-1/2" jelly
  roll pan lined with buttered and floured wax paper and bake it in a
  preheated 350 oven for 25 minutes, or until it is golden and firm to
  the touch. Cover the egg sponge with a sheet of buttered wax paper,
  buttered side down, and a dish towel, invert a baking sheet over the
  towel, and invert the egg sponge onto the baking sheet.  Remove the
  jelly roll pan and the wax paper carefully and trim 1/4" from the
  short sides of the sponge. Fill the sponge with the filling while it
  is still warm and flexible.
  
  Croutons:  Spread the bread cubes in one layer in a jelly roll pan.
  In a small saucepan melt the butter with the garlic, drizzle the
  mixture over the bread, and stir and toss the bread to coat it well.
  Bake the bread in one layer in a preheated 350 oven, turning
  occasionaly, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until croutons are golden.
  Transfer the croutons to paper towels to drain.
  
  Filling: Cook the spinach according to package directions, drain,
  refresh under cold running water, and squeeze it dry. In a food
  processor, puree the spinach with the butter, cream, and Parmesan and
  season the filling with salt and pepper.
  
  Spread the filling over the warm egg sponge in a even layer and
  sprinkle it with the croutons. Roll the roulade jelly-roll fashion,
  beginning with a long side, and trim the ends on the diagonal. With
  the aid of the towel and the wax paper, transfer the roulade, seam
  side down, to an ovenproof platter, spread it gently with the butter,
  and sprinkle it with the Parmesan. Bake the roulade in a preheated
  350 oven for 10 minutes, or until it is heated through and the
  Parmesan is melted.

 Categories: Poultry etc, Pastanoodle
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     22    Precooked dried cannelloni
           -shells (see note)
      2    Chopped tomatoes
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
           SAUCE:
      3 tb Butter
      1    Chopped onion
      3 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Light cream
           Salt and pepper to taste
    3/4 c  Grated Swiss cheese
           FILLING:
  1 1/2 c  Diced cooked chicken
      1 pk Frozen spinach, thawed and
           -drained
    3/4 c  Ricotta cheese
    1/3 c  Toasted slivered almonds
    1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
      1    Egg
    1/4 ts Grated nutmeg
 
  Sauce: Melt butter in a saucepan. Saute onion until tender. Stir in
  flour and cook for 1 minute. Add stock, cream, salt and pepper. Cook
  until boiling and thickened, 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir
  in the Swiss cheese. Cover with waxed paper and set aside.
  
  Filling: Combine chicken, spinach, Ricotta, almonds, Parmesan, egg and
  nutmeg. Blend all ingredients together.
  
  Assembly: Place filling in the pre-cooked shells. Pour a thin layer of
  sauce over the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the stuffed
  cannelloni in a single layer over the sauce. Sprinkle with the
  chopped tomatoes, and pour the sauce over the cannelloni. Sprinkle
  with Parmesan cheese. Cover with aluminium foil. Bake at 350 degrees
  F for 60-70 minutes or until pasta is soft and the top bubbles.
  
  Note: The kind of pasta used in this dish is dried, but is usually
  called "oven ready". I believe it is coated in egg whites to enable
  it to cook right in the oven when well-covered in sauce. If you make
  the dish ahead and refrigerate, the cooking time will be cut down
  because the pasta will soften in the refrigeration.

  1.  In a medium-size sauce-pan heat the drippings over moderate heat.
  Add the onion and celery and saute, stirring occaisionally, for five
  munutes or until the vegetables are tender. Lower the heat, stir in
  the flour and cook, stirring, 3 minutes more or until golden and
  bubbling. (Watch it doesn't get to hot...this is the critical stage.)
  Add the stock and bay leaf, return to a boild, then lower the heat
  and simmer, sitrring frequently, for 10 minutes. Add the milk, salt,
  and pepper and simmer for about 2 minutes or until heated through.
  Remove the bay leaf. Makes a scant more than 8- half cup servings.
  *Spice note: I like to use course ground black pepper (or restaurant
  grind) in order to give the appearance of "Country Gravy" especially
  when serving fried chicken and mashed potatoes, or with biscuits for
  breakfast. Other times I use white pepper, for flavor without
  appearance. Use your imagination and your preferences.

  Grease an 8x8" square pan with butter. Grease a heavy-bottomed
  saucepan with butter. Grate the chocolate into it and add the sugar,
  milk and corn syrup. Stir over low heat until chocolate melts and
  sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil the
  mixture until it reaches soft ball stage (240F.). Stir just enough to
  prevent scorching., remove from the heat and add the butter. Cool to
  lukewarm (110F.) without stirring. Add the vanilla. Beat until the

MMMMM------------------------FOR THE CAKE-----------------------------
  2 1/2 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Milk
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Butter, softened
      4    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
      8 oz Whipped cream, stiff
    1/4 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
    1/2 c  Coconut
      1 ts Vanilla

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FROSTING---------------------------
      2 pk 3 oz ea cream cheese, soft
      2 tb Butter, softened
      2 ts Vanilla
      4 c  Confectioners sugar
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      1 pk 8 oz coconut
 
  1. Preheat oven to 350F. Grease (and flour if you wish) 3 nine (9")
  inch round pans. Mix flour with baking powder and 1/2 ts salt. In a
  large bowl, mixed at high speed beat the butter and 2 cups of sugar
  until light. Add 4 eggs, one at a time, and beat after each time you
  add one. 2. Continue beating, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber
  scraper, until fluffy - about 2 minutes. At low speed, beat in flour
  mixture, in fourths alternating with milk (in thirds) beginning and
  ending with the flour mix. Add vanilla. Beat until just smooth, about
  1 min. 3. Pour into prepared pans, and bake for 25-30 min., or until
  sur- face springs back when lightly touched. Cool pans on wire racks
  10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool thoroughly. 4. Prepare the
  filling: simply whip the cream, adding the sugar and vanilla, and
  keep cool until the cake has cooled completely. 5. Make the frosting:
  cream the cream cheese and sugar together, (both should be soft),
  then add the sugar and vanilla. You might need to add a little milk
  to make it to the consistency you like. 6. When everything is cool
  and ready, place a layer on the plate you will serve it from, top
  side down. Fill with whipped cream filling, and sprinkle with coconut
  and if you would like add chopped walnuts. Repeat with the second
  layer, and then place the top layer on. Frost the sides and the top.
  Cover the entire cake with coconut and if you wish, add chopped
  walnuts.Refrigerate to set the frosting. NOTE: I had to use skewers
  to hold the cake in place while I was frosting it, and it might be a
  good idea to use these to prevent the cake from sliding.

           Paul Prudhommes Poultry
           Magic -- to taste
      1 c  Mushroom -- sliced
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup,
           Condensed
      4 tb Butter -- melted
      8 oz Monterey jack cheese
     12 oz Angel hair pasta
 
  Boil 2-3 quarts of water.  Add 1onion, 1 bell pepper, 2 stalks
  celery; all coarsly chopped.  Season water with salt, pepper,
  cayenne, and prudhommes poultry magic seasoning to taste. Add 4
  boneless chicken breast and boil for about 30 minutes or until
  chicken is done. Strain and save stock. While chicken is cooking;
  Saute 1 bell pepper, 1 onion, and 2 stalks of celery, all finely
  chopped in butter until vegatables are soft. When vegetables are
  almost done, add 1 cup sliced mushrooms and saute until tender. Add 1
  can cream of mushroom soup.  Add cheese to mixture and stir until
  melted. Add 1 cup of above chicken stock. Season mixture to taste
  with salt, pepper, dash of cayenne and Prudhommes poultry magic
  seasoning. Be pretty liberal with the poultry magic.  I add a lot.
  Cut chicken into 1 inch cubes and add to mixture.  Can season more,
  if needed with the above seasonings. Boil angel hair pasta in chicken
  stock and cook according to package directions. Combine pasta with
  chicken sauce. Tip: Can use velvetta cheese, or cream cheese. If I
  use jalapeno cheese, I use Montery Jack cheese with Jalapeno. DO NOT
  USE VELVETTA CHEESE WITH JALEPENO, MAKES IT TOO HOT. The Jalepeno
  cheese is just a variation. Source: Charmaine Hebert

      Title: CREAMY GREEN GARLIC DRESSING
 Categories: Sauces, Salads, Vegetarian, Dressings
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8 lg Roasted garlic cloves
           - peeled
    1/2 c  Minced parsley, packed tight
      2 tb Finely chopped shallots
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      2 oz Silken tofu; mashed

      3 tb White wine vinegar
    1/2 ts Sea salt; or to taste
      2 tb -Water, or more as needed
 
  NOTE:  To roast garlic, peel off as much papery skin from each large

  intact. Brush each head liberally with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place in
  a small, shallow baking dish in the toaster oven and roast at 375 F
  until the outside is lightly browned and the innermost cloves are
  soft, about 20 minutes. Refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 2
  weeks.
  
  DRESSING:  In a blender or food processor, combine all of the
  ingredients and process until smooth, adding water as required to
  create a slightly thick consistency.
  
  Use immediately or refrigerate in a tightly sealed container for up
  to 1 week.  Bring to room temperature before using and reblend, if
  necessary.

      Title: CREAMY PEPPERY PASTA SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Chopped Onion
      3 md Minced Garlic Cloves
     28 oz Canned Whole Tomatoes
      2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
      1 tb Chopped Fresh Basil Leaves
           Or:
      1 ts Dried Basil
    1/2 ts Dried Rosemary
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Ricotta Cheese (See Note)
    1/3 c  Plain Yogurt (See Note)
 
  We like this piquant tomato sauce, which is easy on the calories, but
  if you are in the mood to indulge, try cream in place of the ricotta
  and yogurt. ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~------------- ~-- In a large saucepan, heat the oil and saute the
  onion and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes. Chop the tomatoes,
  reserving the liquid. Add the tomatoes, 1/2 cup of the reserved
  liquid, and the Tabasco sauce, basil, rosemary, and salt to the
  saucepan and mix well. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, adding more
  of the tomato liquid if the sauce is too thick. In a food processor
  or blender, process the ricotta cheese and yogurt until smooth.  Stir
  the mixture into the tomato sauce and heat without allowing it to
  come to a boil. The sauce may look slightly grainy, but appears
  smooth when it is added to hot pasta. NOTE: Low-fat ricotta and
  yogurt can be used.

      Title: CREAMY POLENTA WITH BUTTER & CHEESE
 Categories: Misc
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Polenta (not instant)
           Unsalted butter and freshly
           Grated Parmesan cheese,
           For serving
 
  In a heavy medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Reduce
  the heat to low and add the salt. Slowly pour the polenta into the
  water, stirring constantly. Keep stirring for about 5 minutes, until
  evenly thickened and soupy.  Adjust the heat to the lowest setting so
  that the polenta barely bubbles. Cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring
  every few minutes to keep it from sticking to the pan. If it gets too
  thick, just add water in small amounts until it is the consistency
  you want. When done, eat it right away with butter and Parmesan
  cheese.

  wrap, then with clean damp towel). Brush phyllo sheet with butter and
  fold in half lengthwise.  Brush folded surface with butter. Cut in
  half crosswise. Place 1 phyllo rectangle, buttered side down, in
  prepared pie plate, covering bottom and letting pastry overhang 1

  butter. Place second phyllo rectangle in pie plate, covering bottom
  and letting pastry overhang another section of edge by 1/2-inch;

      Title: CREAMY TROUT MOUSSE
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      2    Trouts (6 oz ea. cleaned) *
      1    Whole egg
      1    Egg white
    1/4 pt Olive or sunflower oil
      5 tb Creamy yoghurt
      1 ts Dijon mustard
  1 1/4 ts Gelatine powder (or more)
           Fresh parsley & tarragon
    1/2    Cucumber
           Caster sugar
           Tarragon vinegar
 
  *Note: In lieu of fresh trout, 1/2 lb cooked and flaked fish may be
  used. Serves 6 as an appetizer, or 3 as a light lunch.
  
  If using fresh trout, poach them in the oven at 350 F (180 C) gas
  mark 4 for 30 minutes, then cool, skin, bone and flake - there should
  be about 8 ounces of cooked flesh.
  
  Separate the egg and use the yolk to make mayonnaise: season it with
  salt and pepper, gradually beat in the oil, then 1 teaspoon or so of
  vinegar to thin and flavour the sauce.
  
  Put the prepared fish into a food processor.  Add the mustard,
  yoghurt and 1 heaped teaspoon each fresh chopped tarragon and
  parsley, and whizz to a perfectly smooth puree. Soak the gelatine
  (more may be necessary in hot weather) in 3 tablespoons cold water,
  let it soften and swell, then dissolve over low heat. Cool for a
  minute or two before adding the liquid gelatine to the fish puree:
  pour it on in a thin stream while the machine is running.  Carefully
  and gradually beat the fish puree into the mayonnaise. Quickly whisk
  the egg whites to snowy peaks and fold them into the fish puree.
  Taste and adjust the seasoning. Divide the mixture between 6 ramekins
  or 3 small souffle dishes. Cover and chill for 2-3 hours until set to
  a soft cream.
  
  Seed the cucumber but do not peel.  Chop it finely, sprinkle it with
  1/4 teaspoon each salt and caster sugar and 1/2 teaspoon tarragon
  vinegar, and set aside for a couple of hours to draw out some of the
  cucumber juices. Drain and pat dry.  Top each mousse immediately
  before serving with a small spoonful of the cucumber - a good crunchy
  contrast to the soft textured mousse - and garnish with a tarragon
  leaf. Oatcakes that have been gently warmed in the oven go well with
  this dish.

  2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/2 ts Sugar

  Preheat the oven to 325~ F. In a large bowl or in the food processor,

  ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a
  floured surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, at most 1/8 inch. The
  thinner these crackers are, the better. Cut out individual 2-inch
  crackers with a cookie cutter, juice can, or sharp knife and arrange
  on a lightly greased or parchement-lined baking sheet. With the tines
  of a fork, prick each cracker 2 or 3 times. Bake for 20 to 25
  minutes, or until lightly browned, turning over once during baking.
  Cool the crackers on a rack until crisp. Yield: 45-50. VARIATIONS: To
  vary the texture, substitute 1/2 cup rolled oats, rye, barley, or
  wheat for an equal amount of flour.

 Categories: Stews, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No ingredients
 
  Selecting the trimmest, fastest-cooking ingredients is the basis for
  instant stews. But the key to creating such a stew is in the assembly
  of those ingredients.
   There are five simple steps to cooking an instant stew in your home
  kitchen: Step 1. In a soup pot, bring broth to a boil over medium-high
  heat. Step 2.  Add tender, lean, skinless poultry or fish that's been
  cut into small pieces. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer
  for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove and reserve the meat. Step 3.  Add hard,
  long-cooking fresh foods like potatoes, carrots or winter squash and
  dried foods like lentils, uncooked white rice and grains, as well as
  any dried herbs or spices. Stir, cover and simmer for 5 to 10
  minutes. Step4. Add dried food, such as various kinds of pasta and
  quick rice (which have shorter cooking times that those mentioned in
  Step 3), canned beans, frozen vegetables, tender fresh vegetables and
  aromatics like garlic or onions. Bring to a boil. Stir, cover and
  cook for 5 to 10 minutes.
   Step 5.  Return cooked poultry or fish to the pot. Add fresh snipped
  herbs, fresh pasta or fresh greens, like spinach or kale. Stir, cover
  and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve the stew immediately.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Boiling water
      1 lg Pkg orange-flavor gelatin
  1 1/2 c  Cold water
           Gummy worms candy
 
  Stir boiling water into gelatin in large bowl at least 2 minutes until
  completely dissolved. Stir in cold water. Pour into pie plate that
  has been sprayed with no-stick cooking spray.
  
  Refrigerate about 1-1/2 hours or until thickened (spoon drawn through
  leaves definite impression). Push gummy worms into gelatin.
  Refrigerate 2 hours or until firm. Unmold.
  
  Helpful hints: Place pie plate on tray before pouring in gelatin to
  prevent spilling. Also, when unmolding, dip the pie plate in warm
  water for about 15 seconds. Gently pull gelatin from around edges
  with moist fingers. Place moistened serving plate on top of pie
  plate. Invert pie plate; holding pie plate and plate together, shake
  slightly to loosen. Gently remove pie plate and center gelatin on
  plate.

 Categories: Spain, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6    Egg yolks, beaten
  2 1/2 tb Cornstarch
  1 1/4 c  Confectioners sugar
      2 c  Milk
      1    Cinnamon stick
           Zest of 1 lemon
      2 tb Brown sugar
 
   Put the egg yolks in a bowl with the cornstarch and confectioners
  sugar. Simmer the milk with the cinnamon stick and lemon zest, then
  add the egg mixture and cook slowly, stirring to avoid lumps until
  the custard thickens ~ do not boil it.
  
   This may be done in a double boiler or in a saucepan placed in a
  larger pan of simmering water. Remove the cinnamon stick and lemon
  zest, divide the custard between 6 3-inch ramekins and leave in the
  refrigerator overnight.
  
   Before serving, sprinkle the top with brown sugar and leave for a few
  seconds under a hot broiler, then cool. Do this about 30 minutes
  beforehand so that the caramel remains crisp.
  
   In Spain, the sugar is caramelized with a salamandra heated on a
  brazier or gas flame. It is obtainable also in specialized shops in
  the UK and the USA

 Categories: French, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Always thought that Irma la Douce was a bimbrelle. Imagine my
  surprise when I found out a bimbrelle is a type of huckleberry...
  
  From the Lorraine region in northern France, this traditional recipe
  utilises a variety of huckleberry called bimbrelle which grows wild
  in the forests of the Vosges. However, it is, if anything, better
  made with cultivated blueberries.
  
  Put 750 g of blueberries into a saucepan and reduce to 1 cup or so of
  very thick puree.  Strain the puree, then add 175 g sugar and the
  juice of a lemon.  Stir well to dissolve.
  
  Melt 7 g gelatine in a tablespoon or so of water in a double boiler
  over simmering water.  Add the gelatine to the berry puree, then add
  200 fresh, whole blueberries. Refrigerate, keeping a close eye on the
  mixture, and meanwhile whip 250 mL cream till barely mounding. As
  soon as the gelatin shows signs of setting, fold in the cream then
  turn the mixture into an oiled mould and refrigerate at least 4 hours.
  
  Serve with more lightly whipped cream, sweetened and flavoured with 1
  tablespoon of cognac.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: CREME BACHIQUE (WHITE WINE CUSTARD WITH HONEY
 Categories: Pudding
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  White wine; Hermitage or
           -other white Rhone wine
    3/4 c  Honey
      1    Strip lemon zest
      1    Cinnamon stick; 2-inch piece
      6 lg Eggs
 
  "Made with white wine in place of milk or cream, it tastes like
  chilled, spiced wine. It's a refreshing end to a large fall or winter
  meal because the flavors are in keeping with the season, and it's
  lighter than a traditional custard."
  
  Combine the wine, honey, lemon zest, and cinnamon stick in a medium
  saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered,
  for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the zest and
  cinnamon.
  
  With a whisk, lightly beat the eggs in a medium heatproof bowl. Whisk
  in the hot wine mixture, pouring slowly at first in a thin steam, and
  then more rapidly. Using a liquid measuring cup divide the mixture
  among 8 4-ounce ramekins or 8 Pyrex custard cups. Cover each with a
  small square of aluminum foil and press the foil around the rim to
  seal.
  
  Set the containers on the steamer rack, place over simmering water,
  cover, and steam until the custard is just set but jiggles in the
  center when shaken, about 10 minutes. Let cool, then refrigerate
  until chilled. Serve very cold.

  "Creme caramel is a great favorite in many restaurants. It is
  basically a super rich baked egg custard made with added heavy cream.
  It looks small and innocent, but packs a devastating amount of
  "shadow energy" (many calories with few nutrients). Our substitutions
  are indeed radical ...but they are delicious and reduce the fat
  significantly.

  baking dish on the oven rack. Place the filled souffle in the dish
  and pour in the hot water - the souffle dishes should be about three
  quarters submerged. Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake
  for 1 hour - the custard should be well set. Take the souffle dishes
  out of the water and let them cool a bit -a bout 1 hour. To serve:
  Loosen the custard from the souffle dish with a knife. Invert the

  any problem with the surface darkening.
  
  Grate the zest of 1 lime and juice 1 or more limes to obtain 3
  tablespoons juice (this can be done ahead of time). Halve 2 large
  avocados, scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender, add 3
  tablespoons of lime juice and 4 tablespoons of caster sugar. Process
  till smooth. Pile the cream into serving dishes and scatter lime zest

    250 g  Self-raising flour
    250 g  Demerara sugar
    250 g  Butter; room temperature
      5 ea Eggs (size 1)
 
  This very rich cake from the West Indies is ideal for those who
  prefer not to ice their Christmas cakes. Indeed, icing is not
  recommended. Just tie a brightly coloured ribbon round it and you
  have a real feast of cake. The fruit and nuts are soaked for a week
  before baking.
  
  Directions: Six to eight days before you intend to bake the cake,
  measure out the rum, brandy, cherry brandy, cointreau, water and
  bitters into a large saucepan. Then add the spices, sugar, fruit and
  nuts. Stir the ingredients together and heat them over a very low
  heat until the liquid is just moving - DO NOT LET IT BOIL. Simmer for
  about 15 minutes. Tip the mixture into a mixing bowl or other glass
  or china container and allow it to cool completely. Cover the bowl
  with a double layer of clingfilm and place in the refrigerator or a
  very cool place. Stir the mixture from time to time during the next
  few days.
  
  Six to eight days later, preheat the oven to Gas 1, 275 F., 140 C.
  Cream the butter and sugar together and fold in the flour and beaten
  eggs. Add the fruit mixture a little at a time until it is evenly
  blended. Spoon the cake mixture into the prepared tin, level the top
  and bake in the preheated oven for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. If you
  think the cake is becoming too brown, place a double thickness of
  greaseproof paper over the top of it as protection. When the cake is
  quite cold, wrap it in greaseproof paper first then either place it
  well in a plastic cake box or wrap it in silver foil.
  
  This cake will keep for a few weeks. Taken from Christmas baking
  magazine.

    1/2 ts Cayenne
     14 oz Can whole tomatoes
      3 oz Tomato paste
           Tabasco sauce -- to taste
           Grated rind and juice from
    1/2    Lemon
      2 tb Parsley fresh -- chopped
 
  Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan and saute the onions, celery,
  and red or green bell pepper over medium heat until soft. Crumble in
  the spices, stirring for another minute. Add the tomatoes, tomato
  paste, lemon juice and rind, cover and simmer on low for about 30
  minutes. After 30 minutes, check the seasoning and add the hot sauce,
  to taste. Stir in the fresh parsley. Variations: This makes an
  extremely thick sauce. I had to add about 1/2 cup water to the sauce.
  Yields approximately 3 1/4 cups of sauce. Great with shrimp used as
  the topping for the pizza, esp. if the shrimp is boiled in crab boil,
  and lightly sprinkled with Creole seasoning. I add the shrimp the
  last 3-4 minutes to the top of the pizza. Source:Pizza Pizzaz, by

      Title: CREOLE SMOKED SAUSAGE & CREOLE HOT SAUSAGE
 Categories: Meats, Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Yards small sausage casing
      4 lb Lean pork (or 2 lb lean
           -pork and 2 lb lean beef)
      2 lb Pork fat
      2 ts Finely minced garlic
      2 ts Freshly ground black
           -pepper
      3 tb Salt
      2 ts Cayenne
    1/2 ts Ground bay leaf
    1/4 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Chili powder
      4 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Sugar
      5 ts Colgin's liquid hickory
           -smoke
 
  New Orleans' most popular sausage, a type of country sausage made with
  pork, or pork and beef. It's not really smoked, but has a fine smokey
  flavor that makes it an ideal seasoning meat for our favorite bean
  dishes, gumbos, and jambalayas.  We also like it pan grilled as a
  breakfast or dinner sausage. [Also makes great po-boys--ECT] Allow
  about 20 to 25 minutes for grilling. When used as a seasoning meat in
  other dishes, it requires no precooking. About 6 pounds of 6-8 inch
  sausage (To make HOT sausage, omit the liquid hickory smoke and add 1
  tsp cayenne and 1 tsp black pepper.)  Hot sausage is a good
  accompaniment to bean dishes or smothered vegetables or as a
  breakfast sausage with grits and eggs. It is not recommended as a
  seasoning meat in traditional bean dishes as it is likely to
  overwhelm the flavor of the other ingredients. Prepare the sausage
  casings and stuffing. Mix ingredients lightly; the stuffing should be
  slightly coarse in texture.  Cut the casing into 12 inch lengths and
  stuff.  Allow 2 smoked sausages per serving.

      Title: CREOLE STUFFING
 Categories: Argentina, Poultry, Stuffing, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     30 g  Butter
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      1 kg Pork and veal mince
      8 sl Stale white bread
           Milk
      1    Bay leaf, crumbled
      1 ts Oregano
      1 tb Parsley, finely chopped
      2    Hard boiled eggs, chopped
      3 tb Pitted Greek olives, chopped
    300 g  Mango flesh, peeled and
           -chopped
           Salt and pepper
      3    Eggs, tightly beaten.
 
  Next time I'm confronted with a hollow turkey it gets filled up with
  this one. This unusual combination of flavours comes from Argentina.
  The original recipe includes fresh peaches but substituting ripe
  mango is an improvement.
  
  Melt the butter and cook the onion gently until it is transparent.
  Add the minced meat and cook until it changes colour, breaking up
  lumps with a fork.  Take off the stove.
  
  Soak the bread in milk, squeeze out and break up.  Mix with the
  onion-meat mixture.  Then add the herbs, eggs, olives, peaches,
  seasonings and eggs. Blend well.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     24    Crepes (make above recipe in
           Double
           Batch)
      1 pk Thawed frozen chopped
           Spinach -- (10 ounces)
           Squeezed dry and cooked with
           Clove,
           Minced garlic in 2
      1 tb Olive oil - with or without
    1/2    Cup
           Slivered smoked ham or
           Proscuitto
           Cheese sauce (see above
           Recipe)
      1 c  Ricotta cheese mixed with 1
           Egg and 1/2
        c  Slivered roasted peppers
      3 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 9-inch deep pie
  plate and center a crepe in the bottom. Mix the spinach filling with
  1/2 cup of the cheese sauce and spread some of this over the first
  crepe. Center a crepe on top of spinach filling and spread it with
  ricotta cheese and pepper filling. Top with a crepe and continue this
  way until you end with a crepe. Spoon cheese sauce over the top of
  the tower and sprinkle with grated Parmesan. Bake for 30 minutes or
  until bubbling hot.
  
  You can assemble the "tower" of crepes and fillings in advance and
  make the sauce in advance, but spoon sauce over crepes right before
  baking. If you have made this in advance and it is cold you will have
  to bake it for
       45    minutes to heat it through.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Cold water and whole milk
      4    Eggs
    1/2 ts Salt
           About 1 1/3 cups flour
           Vegetable oil or melted
           Butter
 
  In a blender or food processor combine the water, milk, eggs salt and
  flour. With a rubber spatula, scrape down any batter which adheres to
  the sides of the processor. If the batter appears thick, add more
  water; if too thin, then gradually whisk in more flour. Let the
  batter set, in the refrigerator for an hour or so.
  
  Rub an 7-inch crepe pan or non-stick pan with oil or melted butter.
  Set over high heat until pan just begins to smoke. Ladle about 3
  tablespoons of batter into the hot pan. Lift the pan from the heat
  and swirl the batter around so that it evenly coats the bottom. Pour
  excess back into the batter for the next crepe. Let the crepe cook on
  one side for about a minute or until it looks dried out. Flip the
  crepe over and cook it for 30 seconds on the other side. Repeat until
  all are done.
  
  To store, stack them, with waxed paper or parchment squares in
  between each one and freeze in batches.
  
  Yield: about 12 crepes
  
  QUICK CREPE IDEAS
  
  Fill each crepe with a couple of tablespoonfuls of lightly sweetened
  ricotta or cottage cheese. Roll up, sprinkle with sugar and run under
  the broiler just to heat. Serve with a topping of mixed chopped up
  fresh fruit
  
  Fill each crepe with ricotta or other cheese combined with chopped
  basil, olives or parsley. Arrange them in a shallow baking dish, dot
  with grated Parmesan and cover with tomato sauce if you wish; and
  brown under a moderate broiler
  
  Fill each crepe with a white or veloute sauce in which you have mixed
  some chopped buttered spinach, or diced chicken or ham. Cover with
  cheese sauce, sprinkle with more 3 to 4 tablespoons more of cheese
  and heat in the oven; brown in the broiler

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------CREPE BATTER-----------------------------
    125 g  Flour (4.5 oz)
     15 g  Sugar (0.5 oz)
      1 pn Salt
      2    Eggs
      3 dl Milk, boiled and cooled
           -- (5/8 pint)
      1 dl Double cream ( 3.5 fl oz)
      1 tb Curagao
           Clarified butter for the pan

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      6    Sugar lumps
      2    Oranges
    180 g  Softened butter ( 6 oz)
    180 g  Sugar
      3 tb Curagao
 
  THE BATTER: Put the flour, sugar and salt in a bowl and stir in the
  eggs, one at a time, with a wooden spatula. Pour in one-third of the
  milk and mix until smooth and homogenous. Stir in the cream, the rest
  of the milk and the curagao, cover the bowl with a plate and leave
  the batter to stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour before
  cooking the crepes. COOKING THE CREPES: Brush the pan with clarified
  butter and heat it. Ladle in a little batter, tilt the pan to spread
  it thinly over the base and cook the crepe for about 1.5 minutes,
  then turn it over with a palette knife and cook for about 1.5 minutes
  more, until golden on both sides. Place the crepe on a plate and make
  more crepes in the same way: you should end up with 18 crepes ! THE
  SAUCE: Rub the sugar lumps again the orange skin to absorb as much
  flavour as possible. With a wire whisk, work together the softened
  butter and sugar, then add the curagao and sugar lumps. SERVING:
  Squeeze the orange juice into a pan, set over high heat and reduce by
  half. Bring the pan to the table, set it on a spirit stove - or a
  fondue heater - and beat the butter mixture into the orange juice,
  bringing the mixture to the boil. As soon as the sauce bubbles, lift
  one crepe at a time with a fork and spread it in the sauce, turn it
  over and fold into quarters. Repeat with all the crepes. --

      Title: CREPES SUZETTE FROM RON' PLAICE IN BLACKPOOL:)
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 4 7/16 oz Flour
 1 7/16 oz Sugar, icing/confectioners
    1/2    Lemon, rind, grated
      2    Egg yolks
      1    Egg whole
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Cream, single
  1 3/4 oz Butter
           Butter for cooking
      3    Oranges
      1    Lemon
 1 1/16 oz Sugar, regular kind:)
  2 2/3 tb Grand Marnier or similar
    1/4 c  Brandy
     10    Sugar lumps
 
  This dish, above all others, evokes that French 'feeling' in foreign
  restaurants.  Easy to cook once you get the batter just right. The
  Grand Marnier can be substituted with any suitable orange flavored
  liqueur. Delicious made with Southern Comfort. An 'adult' dessert for
  a special occasion.  Bon appetite mon cherie! From Ron's Plaice in
  Blackpool for a sweet lady in the USA ;-)
  
  The Crepe: [Pancake] Mix the flour with the icing/confectioner sugar
  and grated rind of half a lemon in a bowl. Beat the egg yolks and egg
  with the milk and cream, and stir into the flour. Beat all to a
  smooth batter. Melt the butter and stir into batter mix. Cook in a
  very hot pan with a little of the butter for cooking. Each crepe
  should be very thin and about 6 inches across. Keep hot!
  
  The Sauce: Wash and dry the oranges and lemons. Rub the sugar lumps
  over the rind to extract the wonderful aromatic oils. [I can almost
  smell it from here:)] Squeeze the fruits to extract the juice.  Heat
  some butter in a large pan,add the sugar lumps and sugar [regular
  type as used in coffee]. Once melted, add the orange and lemon juice,
  and cook for a few minutes. While stirring, add the Grand Marnier.
  Heat the crepes, one by one in the sauce,turning several times;
  almost all the sauce should be absorbed by the crepes.  Roll up all
  crepes and return to the pan. Warm the brandy, pour it over the
  crepes in the pan, set it alight 'Whooof'! Flambe by leaving the
  crepes in the pan until the flames die down. Serve at once. Once
  consumed, you should turn down the lights, 'snuggle' up on the
  settee, and discuss the merits of French Cuisine in whispers. Bon
  appetite :-) From Ron's Place in Blackpool, just a whisper from your
  heart :-)

  separate bowl, combine the sherry and milk. Gradually add the dry
  ingredients to the eggs, alternately with the milk mixture. Beat
  until smooth. Let the batter stand, covered with plastic wrap, for 30
  minutes. Heat a crepe pan over moderate heat and lightly brush with
  melted butter. When butter is hot, add just enough batter to cover
  the bottom of the pan, tilting the pan and distributing the batter to
  make a very thin crepe. Cook until brown underneath and quickly turn
  and cook the other side. Continue cooking crepes until all of the
  batter is used, brushing pan with butter as necessary. Sauce: Reserve
  1/4 cup berries for garnish. In a bowl combine the berries with sugar
  to taste. Add the sherry and mix lightly. To serve, fill each crepe
  with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and 2 tablespoons of the
  sauce.  Fold the crepe into the desired shape and top with a small
  dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with a fresh berry. Serves 4 to 6.

  3 1/2    Chicken, cut into serving
           -pieces, breast cut into 4
           -pieces
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
      4    Garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves, crushed
      2    Bay leaves
      8 c  Chicken stock
      3 lg Russet potatoes, peeled,
           -cut into chunks
      6    Carrots, cut into 2-inch
           -pieces
      3 ct Of corn, cut into 3-inch
           -pieces
      1    Egg yolk, beaten
    1/2 c  Cream
      2 ts Arrowroot (optional)
      2 tb Minced parsley
      1 tb Minced cilantro
 
  This chicken and vegetable soup is an Argentinean classic. It is as
  thick as a stew and as creamy as a bisque.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F.
  
  Spread half of the onions in a large, deep baking dish. Place chicken
  on top.  Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle garlic, thyme and bay
  leaves over chicken. Spread remaining onions on top; drizzle with 1
  cup stock. Roast uncovered for 30 minutes, or until chicken turns
  golden around the edges.
  
  Place chicken (remove skin, if desired), onions, garlic and herbs in a
  6-quart soup pot.  Deglaze roasting pan with some water or stock and
  add to the pot. Add the remaining stock and the potatoes to the pot.
  
  Simmer for 15 minutes, then add the carrots and corn. Simmer for 25
  minutes.
  
  Using a wide fork, roughly mash at least 4 of the "falling apart"
  potato chunks to help thicken the soup.
  
  Beat egg yolk into the cream, then beat in 1/2 cup of the stock from
  the soup pot.  Blend in the arrowroot if you want a thicker soup.
  Pour the cream mixture back into the soup, stirring until
  well-blended.
  
  Just before serving, add the minced parsley and cilantro. Ladle into
  wide, deep soup bowls.  Make sure each bowl has a chunk of potato, a
  piece of chicken, a couple of carrots and a piece of corn.
  
  Serves 6.

      2 c  Brown sugar
      2    Eggs
  2 2/3 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Cloves

      1 c  Walnuts, chopped
      1 c  Raisins
    1/3 c  Milk
 
  In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar together.
  Add the eggs and stir vigorously until the mixture is well blended.
  In a small bowl, mix together all the dry ingredients except the
  raisins and walnuts. Then add the dry ingredients and the milk to the
  butter mixture, stir it in gently, and when it is all moistened, stir
  hard to mix it all together evenly. You should have a stiff batter.
  Fold in the raisins and nuts and mix them in well. Grease your cookie
  sheet, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Drop the dough onto the
  sheet by the spoonful. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the

      Title: CRISP FRIED POTATO LATKES
 Categories: Vegetables, Pancakes
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
  2 1/2 lb Potatoes; pref. baking type
           - such as Russet or Idaho
           - peeled
      1 lg Onion
      3 lg Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 ts Salt; or to taste
    1/8 ts Black Pepper, fresh ground
           - or to taste
    1/4 c  Matzo meal; about   -=OR=-
      2 tb -All-Purpose Flour, or more
           -Pref. unbleached

MMMMM-------------------------FOR FRYING------------------------------

MMMMM--------------------------TO SERVE-------------------------------
 
  Vegetable Oil Applesauce Sour Cream or Plain Yogurt
  
  Shred or grate the poatoes althernately with the onion to keep the
  potatoes from darkening.  (The size of the shreds is a matter of
  personal taste.) Coarse shreds produce lacier latkes with rough
  edges. Fine shreds or grated potatoes produce denser, smoother
  latkes.) Squre the excess liquid from the potato and onion shreds.
  Mix in the eggs, salt, pepper and matzo meal (or flour).  Let the
  mixture rest for about 5 mins., so that the matzo meal can absorb
  some moisture.  If the mixture still seems very wet, add a bit more
  matzo meal.
  
  In a very large skillet, over med.-high heat, heat oil that is about
  1/8-1/4" deep until it is very hot but not smoking. To form each
  latke, use a large spoon to transfer some of the potato mixture to
  the oil; then flatten the mixture slightly with the back of a spoon.
  The latkes will be irregularly shaped.  An alternative method (which
  makes more evenly shaped latkes) is to press some of the potato
  mixture into a large serving spoon; then carefully slide it off the
  spoon into the hot oil.
  
  Continue making latkes until the skillet is full, leaving a little
  room between each one.  Fry the latkes until they are well browned on
  both sides and crisp around the edges. Drain them well on paper
  towels. Repeat the process until all the latkes are fried.
  
  Serve the latkes as soon as possible for the best taste and texture.
  Accompany the latkes with applesauce, sour cream, and/or yogurt, as
  desired.

  than solid like most cheesecakes, however if you prefer a "normal"
  cheesecake raise the temp about 25 degrees and cook a little longer.

      Title: CRISP POTATO FLATBREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      1 lg Baking Potato; unpeeled
    1/2 c  Milk; heated to 110 degrees
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 ts Sugar
      1    Egg
      3 tb Butter; softened
  1 1/2 c  Bread flour
      3 tb Rosemary; chopped
           Olive Oil
           Coarse Kosher Salt
 
  :       Preheat the oven to 400d.
   Prick the potato all over with a fork and bake in the oven for one
  hour or until soft.
    Remove from the oven, peel and mash the potato until smooth with the
  paddle attachment of a heavy duty stand mixer.
   Allow to cool.
   Meanwhile, in a measuring cup, whisk together the milk, yeast, and
  sugar.
   Proof the yeast for 10 minutes until very foamy with the egg and
  softened butter.
   Gradually beat in the flour and the rosemary until smooth. The
  mixture will be more like a batter than a dough.
   Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature
  until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour.
   Stir down with a wooden spoon, cover and refrigerate overnite.
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly oil or spray a 13" by 9"
  baking sheet. Using oiled hands spread the dough evenly over the
  sheet.
   Set aside until doubled, about 45 minutes.
   Drizzle with a little olive oil and the salt.
   Bake for 25 minutes or until golden.
   Cut into wedges and serve.
  :       This recipe can be altered in many ways. Change the herb to
  one of your own choosing. You can add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of any of the
  following; chopped sundried tomatoes chopped green onions chopped
  Greek olives chopped roasted red pepper crumbled or shredded cheeses

      Title: CRISP QUESADILLAS
 Categories: American, Cheese, Mexican
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Flour tortillas (the biggest
           Thinnest ones you can find)
           Oil for frying
           Shredded cheddar, jack or
           Jalapeno cheese (or a
           Mixture)
           Salsa for spooning on the
           Above
 
  Heat the oil in a large skillet (it should be at least 1/4 inch
  deep). When the oil is very hot, but not smoking, place a flour
  tortilla in it. It will almost immediately puff up slightly and begin
  to brown. Turn and cook the other side, and when the tortilla is
  quite crisp, remove from the oil, and drain on paper towels. This may
  be done several hours in advance, if necessary.
  
  At serving time, top the tortilla with a generous handful of grated
  cheese, and pop it under the broiler until the cheese is just melted
  (this will only take a couple of minutes).
  
  To eat this, everyone breaks off a hunk, tops it with a little hot
  sauce or salsa, and eats.  I normally allow one 8-inch tortilla per
  person, or 1 12-14 inch tortilla for 2 people.

      Title: CRISP ROASTED PIG'S HEAD
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Head
 
      1    Pig's head, cleaned and
           -tongue removed
      1 ts 5-spice powder
      2 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Mien see (ground brown bean
           -sauce) or 1/2 cup oyster
           -sauce
    1/4 c  Bourbon
      1 c  Honey, combined with
      1 c  Boiling water
 
  Remove any hair on head by singeing over and open flame or plucking.
  Scrub well (using a vegetable brush, if desired) and then sprinkle
  with salt, rubbing it into the skin.  Rinse well with cool water; pat
  dry. Remove any excess fat.
  
  Place head in a colander in the sink and pour a kettle full of boiling
  water over.  Let cool.
  
  Combine the 5-spice powder, salt, bean sauce and bourbon. Slash the
  meat on underside of head and rub half of the spice mixture into the
  meat. Rub the remaining spice mixture onto the skin.  Place head
  upright on a rack in a large baking pan.  Bake at 375F for 1 1/2
  hours. Lower heat to 325F and continue cooking for an additional 2
  hours, or until the meat is cooked through, basting the skin well
  every 30 minutes with the honey-water mixture.  (Cooking time will
  depend on the size of the head.) If ears begin to brown too quickly
  during cooking period, wrap them with foil.
  
  When head is done, remove to platter and garnish with watercress or
  coriander.  Chop head into pieces and serve with sweet vegetable
  relish or plum sauce.
  
  [I'd definitely serve with spiced salt and Chinese mustard and minced
  green onions for dipping too.]

      Title: CRISP SHIP CRACKERS - GALLETAS MARINAS
 Categories: Mexican, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Jim vorheis
      4 ts Rounded  (about 1/2 oz)
      1 tb Heaped unsalted butter
           -crumbled cake yeast or 2
           -softened
           -rounded ts dry yeast
      1 tb Heaped lard; plus extra
      1 lb Unbleached flour; plus extra
           -for greasing trays; etc
           -for kneading
  1 1/4 c  Lukewarm water
  1 1/2 ts Sea salt
           -approximately 110 f
 
  Have ready 3 large, well-greased baking sheets. Stir the salt and fat
  into 1 cup of the water and keep stirring until the salt has
  dissolved and the butter melted. Put the crumbled yeast into a small
  bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the remaining water and work to a smooth
  cream with the back of a wooden spoon. Form the flour in a rough
  circle on your work surface, making a well in the center; pour the
  creamed yeast into it and begin to work in the surrounding flour,
  sprinkling the mixture with the salted, fatty water. Mix well and
  gather into a rough ball. Lightly flour the board and begin kneading
  until the dough comes to life and is smooth and elastic - about 3
  minutes.
  
   Roll the dough into a sausage shape about 2 inches in diameter and
  then cut with a plastic dough scraper into 25 pieces - if weighing,
  they should be just over 1 ounce each. Roll each piece of dough under
  your palms into a small ball about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place
  the balls of dough about 2 inches apart on the greased trays. Smear
  the inside of your hands with more lard or butter and spread the
  outside of the balls with a light coating so that the outside skin of
  the dough will not dry out. Cover the trays with greased plastic wrap
  and set in a war place, about 75 - 80 F, to ferment and rise to about
  half their size again - about 1 hour.
  
   Heat the oven to 325 F.  Again, lightly grease your hands and press
  each ball down firmly to make a circle of the dough about 2 1/2
  inches in diameter and about 1/4 inch thick. Cover with greased
  plastic wrap and set to rise at the same temperature for about 40
  minutes. At the end of this time they will have risen slightly and be
  soft and puffy on top.
  
   Bake, changing the trays from top to bottom of the oven halfway
  through the cooking time, until they are dry and crisp right through
  and a light biscuit color ~ about 1 1/4 hours.

      Title: CRISP SPLIT PEAS
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Yellow split peas
      2 ts Baking soda
           Vegetable oil
           -- for deep-frying
    1/2 ts Chili powder
    1/2 ts Ground coriander
      1 pn Ground cinnamon
      1 pn Ground cloves
      1 ts Salt
 
  Rinse and sort the peas, then place in a large bowl and add enough
  cold water to cover.  Stir in baking soda. Let soak overnight.
  
  Drain peas, rinse several times in cold water and drain thoroughly.
  Let stand at least 30 minutes, then spread out on paper towels and
  let dry thoroughly.  In a deep, heavy saucepan, heat about 2 inches
  of oil to 350 F (180 C) or until a 1-inch bread cube turns golden
  brown in about 65 seconds.  Add peas, a portion at a time, and cook
  until golden. (Be careful when cooking peas; even when completely
  dry, they often cause oil to bubble to top of pan.)  Remove peas from
  hot oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
  
  Turn cooked peas into a small bowl.  Sprinkle with chili powder,
  coriander, cinnamon, cloves and salt; mix to coat peas with spice
  mixture. Cool completely; store in an airtight container until ready
  to serve.
  
  Makes about 1-3/4 cups.

  sticking. Flip noodle cake over and brown other side. Transfer
  noodles to heat-proof serving platter and keep warm in oven at 200
  degrees. Reheat pan and add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable
  oil. Again, heat until very hot.  Add garlic and ginger-root and

      Title: CRISPY BOTTOM BASMATI RICE WITH LENTILS (HOT
 Categories: T v f n, Hot tamales
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 c  Basmati rice
      2 tb Sea salt -- plus 1 teaspoon
      4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
      1 lg Onion -- finely diced
      2 c  Brown lentils -- washed and
           Drained
      5    Garlic cloves -- minced
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Hungarian paprika
      1 bn Fresh basil leaves --
           Julienned
 
  Wash the rice in several changes of warm water until the water runs
  clear. Soak the rice for 6 to 8 hours or overnight, in cold water to
  cover, with 1 tablespoon of the salt. (Alternatively, to save time,
  soak the rice in lukewarm water with the salt for 30 to 45 minutes.)
  Heat a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add 2
  tablespoons of the olive oil and the onion. Cook until the onion
  becomes translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the lentils, garlic,
  pepper, and paprika. Continue cooking 2 minutes. Add 2 cups of water,
  cover, and cook until tender, about 45 minutes. Season with the 1
  teaspoon salt, or to taste. Stir in the basil. In a large saucepan,
  over mediumhigh heat, bring 2 1/2 quarts of water to a boil with the
  remaining 1 tablespoon of salt. Drain the rice from the soaking
  liquid and add it to the boiling water. Return to a boil and cook for
  10 to 12 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Test a grain of
  rice for doneness; it should be cooked entirely except for a small
  part in the center. Strain the rice in a colander and rinse with warm
  water. Drain well. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a
  large, wellseasoned or nonstick stock pot with a tight-fitting lid,
  over medium heat. Add about 2 tablespoons water and sprinkle the
  cooked rice evenly onto the bottom of the pot a spoonful at a time
  until twothirds of the rice has been distributed. Spread the lentil
  mixture evenly over the rice. Cover the lentils with the remaining
  rice, mounding it slightly in the center. Use the handle of a wooden
  spoon to poke about 5 deep holes in the rice from the surface of rice
  to the bottom of the pot to allow steam to escape. Cover the pot with
  a thick cotton dish towel and place the lid on tightly. Reduce the
  heat to mediumlow and cook for 35 to 40 minutes, turning the pot
  occasionally. Fill the sink with cold water 1 or 2 inches deep.
  Remove the cover from the rice and have a large, round platter ready.
  Place the pot in the sink for 1 minute, watching so that no water
  enters the pot. Remove the pot and dry off the bottom, then invert
  the rice cake onto the platter. It should unmold itself in one piece
  and be golden brown. Bring the platter to the table and serve family
  style. Cut individual wedges from the rice cake, similar to cutting a
  pie.

  layers together 'into a round shape. Flatten it into a long shape
  with a rolling pin.  Roll it up towards you, to form a tube shape.
  Place tube sideways on work surface, roll it flat and fold it from
  left to right in thirds.  Flatten it again. 5. Place some filling
  paste (approximate 1/3 tsp) on flattened dough. Roll it up into a
  ball, then flatten half of the ball lightly. Press a knife into
  flattened end to make indented lines forming five "fingers", folding
  one or two inwards. On back of "hand", draw a few lines across the
  surface. At thick end indent a hole with a chopstick. 6. Brush
  completed set of "hands" with egg yolk. Bake in an oven at medium
  heat for approximately 12 minutes until golden. (The peach garnish
  recipe is not included. It is steamed dough with colouring and
  decorative leaves and stem.)

 Categories: Low-cal, Cookies
      Yield: 36 Cookies
 
    1/3 c  Butter (margarine)
    1/3 c  Lightly packed brown sugar
    1/4 c  Warm water
      1 c  Flour, divided 1/4 cup aside
      1 c  Quick rolled oats
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Baking soda
 
  My note:  these keep fairly well in a covered container, and freeze
  well according to the cookbook. Try ginger (used in some Australian
  ANZAC cookies) instead of cinnamon.
  
  Cream butter and sugar together thoroughly, then beat in water. Set
  aside 1/4 cup flour for rolling.  Mix together the remaining dry
  ingredients, then stir them into the creamed mixture.
  
  Add the remaining flour gradually to the dough until it is stiff
  enough to roll.  Divide the dough into 3 lumps about the same size.
  Roll each lump of dough out about 1/8 inch thick and cut into 12
  pieces about the same size. This is much easier than trying to use a
  cookie cutter if you need to know cookies per serving.
  
  Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 F about 10
  minutes or until golden brown around the edges. Remove from pan,
  cool. Store in a covered container. Makes about 36 cookies.

      1    Rattlesnake; cut in strips
           Flour
           Salt & Pepper
           Crisco
 
  PREPARATION Cut rattlesnake into 8" strips about 1/4" thick. Salt and
  pepper lightly. Put flour into a container that can be covered. Add
  strips. Shake. Refrigerate for about two hours. This will allow the
  flour to become sticky and while the Crisco is heating in a deep
  fryer, pull the pieces apart and re-flour the pieces again. Add flour
  if necessary. When the Crisco shortening is hot, add only enough
  snake strips so that all pieces are covered by the hot grease.  Fry
  until golden brown. Dump into a container that has been prewarmed in
  the oven. Continue frying the rest of the rattlesnake strips.
  
  NOTE:  The fried rattlesnake strips will appear to be coiled!
  
  SERVING Use a basket lined with a cloth napkin. Add the fried, coiled
  snake pieces. Cover with the napkin.

 Categories: Misc
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Round steak
      2 tb Water
      1 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Cooking oil
      1    Egg
      1 c  Dry bread crumbs
    1/4 ts Ginger
           Dash of pepper
           ------------------------
           SWEET & HOT SAUCE
    1/3 c  Catsup
  2 1/2 tb Vinegar
    1/4 ts Dry mustard
  2 1/2 tb Sugar
  2 1/2 tb Soy sauce
    1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce
 
  Recipe Source: Cristel Morton, London, Ontario, Canada.
  
  Trim fat from steak.  Cut steak into 3/4 inch wide strips.
  
  Beat the egg in a bowl with water until well mixed.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix bread crumbs, salt, ginger and pepper.
  
  Dip strips in egg mixture, then roll through crumb mixture. Arrange
  strips on a baking sheet *SEE NOTE BELOW* Chill in refrigerator at
  least 15 minutes *SEE NOTE BELOW*
  
  Depending on the size of the steak and the thickness of the cut, more
  egg and crumb mixture may be necessary.
  
  Heat oil in a large fry pan until hot. Oil should be about 1/4 inch
  deep in the pan. Remove strips from refrigerator and fry in oil a few
  at a time for about 30 - 40 sec per side (top & bottom) turning once.
  Do not overcook.
  
  Remove strips and drain on paper towel.  Keep the strips warm.
  (Placing paper towel on a cookie sheet and placing in a 200F oven
  seems to work well.)
  
  SWEET & HOT SAUCE:
  
  Combine all ingredients for the sauce in a saucepan (or measuring
  cup) and stir together well. Heat on stove top, or in microwave until
  bubbly hot.
  
  Serve beef strips with hot sauce and french fries.
  
  NOTE: The steak can be cut and frozen so that the preparation time is
  greatly reduced. After the steak is cut, roll in flour and arrange so
  that the strips can be laid out to thaw in a single layer. If the
  strips are still chilled when it's time to cook them, just dip into
  the egg, roll in crumbs and place directly into the hot oil. The
  chilling process is to firm up the egg & crumb mixture so that they
  don't fall off the meat during the frying. If the meat is already
  sufficiently cold (from defrosting), the chilling in the refrigerator
  is not necessary.

  desired) mix until evenly colored. Add popcorn and toss until evenly
  coated. Spread popcorn mixture in a single layer on greased sheets of
  foil and allow to cool and harden. Break into bite-size pieces and
  mix with candy corn in a wide shallow bowl; set aside. To make
  spiders, cut licorice into 2 inch lengths. To make legs, starting at
  one end, make three 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch cuts to make four legs.
  Repeat cuts at opposite end. Leave about 1/2 inch in center uncut.
  Gently pull legs apart and curl down. Push wooden pick through center
  of body, leaving about 1/4 inch exposed on top. Push one gumdrop onto
  exposed pick to make a body. Using writing tip of decorating icing,
  squeeze two small dots of icing into gumdrops. Press jaw-breakers
  into icing to make eyes. Place"spiders" and worm-shaped candies in
  popcorn. Remove wooden picks before eating. Makes 4 quarts.

      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
 
  Place half of veggies in the pot, add chicken. Mix pepper and spices
  and sprinkle over meat. Add the rest of veggies and top with the
  soup. Sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce. Cover and cook on LOW 8 to
  10 hours, or until meat is very tender and veggies are done. I put it
  on in the morning and its ready whenever we are. The only bad part
  about this recipe is that you have to take the meat off the bones.
  Mine is usually cooked to the point where it falls off the bones but
  you still have that mess. If desired, potatoes may be omitted and the
  stew, when done, may be served with large macaroni cooked separately.
  Leftovers can be refrigerated all in the same pot and reheated in
  bowls in the microwave at 50% power.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Pot roast (or chuck)
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      3 lg Carrots, peeled and sliced
     16 oz Can diced tomatoes, with
           -their juice
 
  I prefer to brown the roast on top of the stove beforehand, although
  this is not necessary.  I just brown it on all sides in a little
  vegetable oil.
  
  Place the onion and carrots on the bottom of the crock pot (you'll
  need at leasta 4 quart crock pot for this recipe). Put the meat on
  top and season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the tomatoes over
  all and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, or on high for 4 to 5 hours.
  This is particularly wonderful served with noodles or mashed potatoes
  alongside. If you can manage to do the prep work the night before,
  it's a good meal for those times when you'll be out all day and
  wantto come home to something comforting.  Enjoy!

      1    Set of instructions
 
                          Breads & Cakes
  
  :    There are a few tricks to remember when "baking" in one of these
  pots. First, turn the control to HIGH (or to the setting which is
  equivalent to the HIGH used in the recipes). The LOW setting is too
  low to give breads and cakes the texture you expect. :
    With breads, remember to cover the container with a lid or foil.
  Tie the lid or foil onto the container and place the container on a
  meal rack or trivet inside the pot. If you don't have a metal rack or
  trivet to fit your slow cooker, crumple foil and place it in the
  bottom of the pot to support the baking container. Pour 2 cups of hot
  water around the container to provide steam for cooking the bread. :
    When using a deep fryer type of slow cooker, check frequently to
  make sure the water hasn't evaporated. Add more water if needed.
  :    In general, it is not a good idea to remove the lid or foil from
  the bread container during the first 2 hours of cooking. After that,
  check the bread by inserting a toothpick in the mixture. If the
  toothpick comes out clean, the bread is done.
  :    When using a standard cake mix, the procedure is slightly
  different. Cakes are "baked" in a pan set directly on the bottom of
  the slow cooker, similar to the way you would do it in an oven.  [You
  do??? --KL] :    It is not necessary to use a trivet or water.
  Instead of covering the uncooked cake mixture with foil or a lid,
  cover the top with four or five layers of paper towels.  Because
  there is more mosture in a slow cooker than in an oven, it is
  necessary to compensate for this with the paper towels to help absorb
  the moist top of the cake mix. Also, leave the lid of your slow
  cooker slightly open to let extra moisture escape. :    The type and
  kind of container to use for breads and cakes will depend on the size
  of your pot. The following containers hold equivalent amounts of
  batter, and so will substitute for each other:
  
  Coffee can, 2 lb                two coffee cans, 1 lb Mole, 6-7 cup
  capacity          baking dish, 1 1/2 quart Three vegetable cans, 16 oz
  
  Souffle dishes and springform pans also work, when they fit in the
  pot.

      Title: CROCK POT ROAST--KATHY PITTS
 Categories: Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Fairly lean pot roast
      1 pk Dehydrated onion soup mix
      1    Onion, thinly sliced
 
  Place half the onion in bottom of roast.  Rub the roast with the soup
  mix. Place roast in pot, and top with remaining onion. Cover and cook
  on low heat for at least 12 hours. Do not panic and add water--it
  will make its own juices.
  
  You can add carrots or potatoes to the roast.  Just be sure to place
  veggies in the bottom, so they will absorb the juices. Posted on

 Categories: Poultry, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Carrots, sliced
      1    Onion, quartered
      3    Celery stalks w/leaves
           - cut in 1-inch pieces
      6    Mushrooms, med size, sliced
      2    Garlic cloves
           - coarsely chopped
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Basil leaves
    1/2 c  Water, chicken broth,
           - or white wine
      1    Whole chicken, about 3 lbs
 
  Put carrots, celery, and mushrooms in bottom of crock-pot. Place whole
  chicken on top.  Place onions and garlic around chicken, placing some
  of each in cavity of the chicken. Top with the salt, pepper, and
  liquid. Sprinkle the basil over the chicken.  Cover and cook on LOW
  for 8 to 10 hours (using HIGH, 3 1/2 to 5 hours using 1 cup liquid).
  Remove chicken and veggies.  I serve this with rice, but you could
  also add some potatoes in the crock- pot (if you have room) and
  that'll work, too. FOR A GRAVY, I've used 4 tb of flour in the
  "drippings" and used a hand blender (it came out nicely)...  Or you
  can use 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup blended into the "drippings."

      1    Onion, medium; sliced
      1    Celery stalk w/leaves
           - cut in 1-inch pieces
      2 cn Tomato paste; 6 oz. each
           - 1 can w/garlic
    1/2 c  Chianti; or any wine
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 ts Creole seasoning
      1    Bay leaf
      6    Mushrooms, large; sliced
      3    Garlic cloves
    1/2 ts Basil
      2 ts Oregano
      1    Chicken, whole, about 3 lbs.
 
  Place sliced onion in bottom of crock-pot.  Add chicken -- you can
  either use a whole chicken or chop it up in pieces. Stir together
  tomato paste (as indicated, I used 1 can of "regular" tomato paste
  and 1 can with garlic), creole seasoning (I used Konriko brand),
  pepper, garlic, herbs, and 1/4 cup of wine.  I went against
  "tradition" and used a red wine. I like the way reds blend with
  tomato sauces.  In this case, I used a light Chianti. Pour over
  chicken.  Pour remaining wine over chicken as well. Cover and cook on
  LOW for 7 to 9 hours (HIGH 3 to 4 hours).  Serve chicken over hot
  buttered spaghetti, vermicelli, fettucini, or other pasta.

      Title: CROCKPOT APPLESAUCE WITH CRANBERRIES (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Dec., Crockpot
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     10    12 medium apples
      1    To 2 cups cranberry juice
    1/2    Lemon juiced
      2 tb Sugar, or up to 1/4cup if
           You want it sweet
    1/4    To 1/2 cup dried cranberries
           Or "craisins" (sweetened
           Dried
           Cranberries)
 
  Wash the apples and chop them up without peeling. Squeeze lemon juice
  over them as you cut them.
  
  Put apples in crockpot with cranberry juice -- use 1 cup if you want
  the applesauce thick, more if you want it thin. Stir in sugar to suit
  your taste.
  
  Let apples stew on low for 6-8 hours.  About an hour or two before
  serving, stir in cranberries or craisins. (All I found at my store was
  craisins--since they're sweetened, I used less sugar.)
  
  The applesauce is a very pretty pink and the cranberries & juice give
  it a nice zing.
  
  As you can see, the recipe is simple and forgiving -- let the apples
  stew a little longer or a little less ~- the longer you stew them the
  mushier the applesauce will be. It warms up nicely, or you can eat it
  cold.

 Categories: Crockpot, Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Round steak; lean
      2    Green peppers; sliced thin
      2 tb Dried onions; minced
      1 c  Beef broth
      2 tb Low sodium soy sauce
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
      1    Garlic clove; minced
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
 
  Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 8:00 * Use dried onions
  or finely chop about 1/2 of a fresh onion.
  
       1. Cut the steak into serving size pieces. If desired you can
  brown the meat in a little hot oil before adding to crockpot. Place
  the thinly sliced pepper rings in bottom of crockpot, reserving a few
  to place on top of meat if desired. (Vegetables cook better when
  placed on bottom of pot.) Arrange the meat on pepper, careful to not
  stack one piece directly on top of another. Mix all other ingredients
  and pour over meat and peppers.
       2. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for about 4
  hours. Serve with mashed potatoes and simply seasoned vegetables.

      Title: CROCKPOT BEEF CASSEROLE
 Categories: Casseroles, Crockpot
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      2 lb Stewing beef, cubed
           Seasoned flour
      1    Onion, thinly sliced
      4 oz Mushrooms, sliced
      1 cn 10 oz can, beef/oxtail
           -/tomato soup or
    1/2 pt Beef stock
           Salt and pepper
           Dried mixed herbs (opt)
           Oil or lard for frying
 
  Coat the meat with the flour.  Saute the onion in the oil and
  transfer to the slow cooker.  Brown the meat and place on top of the
  onions. Add the mushrooms and herbs, then pour over the soup or
  stock, and cook on High for 4 - 5 hours or on Low for 8 - 10 hours.
  
  Any beef casserole can be adapted for the slow cooker, remembering
  that less liquid is needed than with conventional cooking, and the
  vegetables must be placed in the bottom of the crockpot with the meat
  on top.

      Title: CROCKPOT BEEF STEW
 Categories: Main dish, Meats, Soups, Stews, Crockpot
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Beef, extra lean
      7    Carrots, 2" chunks
  2 1/2    Potatoes, cut in eighths
  2 1/2    Onions, sweet, cut in
           -1/4" slices, slices
           -cut in half and separated
           -into rings.
      1    Tomatoes, Italian-style
           -canned,stewed tomatoes,
           -undrained (or plain)
      2 tb Flour (or 3)
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Thyme
    1/4 ts Basil
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce (or 3)
 
  Layer the veggies and meat (in that order), mix flour and seasonings
  and sprinkle over each meat layer. Sprinkle with Worcestershire
  sauce, pour stewed tomatoes over all, cover and cook on Low 10-12
  hours.
  
  Variable amounts are for 3-1/2 or 5 quart pots.  I make mine up the
  night before and refrigerate.  My hubby (an early riser) puts it on
  about 7 AM and it cooks all day. There is lots of gravy, which may be
  thickened with cornstarch if de- sired. Sometimes instead of
  potatoes, I cook large elbow macaroni separately (Muellers Ready-cut)
  and put the >>>>>> leftover macaroni in the bowl with leftover stew
  to soak up the good gravy. I also add a drained can of cut green
  beans to the veggies (during the last 4 hours) in that case.

      Title: CROCKPOT BLACK BEANS & RICE
 Categories: Crockpot, Vegetables
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Dried black turtle beans
      1 lg Bell pepper (diced)
      1    Hot pepper (optional)
      4 ds Tabasco (optional)
      4 lg Onions (diced)
      6 cl Garlic (diced)
    3/4 c  Celery (diced)
    1/4 c  Parsley (minced)
      2 tb Oregano (minced)
      2 tb Basil (minced)
      2    Bay leaves
      1 pn Cloves (2 to 3)
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
      4    Beef boullion cubes
      2 tb Vinegar (add last)
      1 lb Lean bulk pork sausage
      1 lb Pork (boneless cubed)
      1 lb Stew beef chunks
    1/2 lb Ham, smoked (1/2" cubes)
  1 1/2 lb Smoked link sausage cut into
           1" to 2" lengths
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Beans: Wash and look for gravel then soak overnight in a bowl being
  sure beans are well covered with water. For cooking use a large crock
  pot.
  
  Meats: First, brown bulk sausage in a skillet and pour off excess
  grease. Add other meats and stir to brown. Add bell pepper, onion,
  garlic, celery, and spices. Salt and pepper moderately, taste after
  cooking several hours and add more if needed.
  
  Add beans and soak water. If necessary add more water to cover entire
  ingredients by at least two inches. Stir in four bouillon cubes.
  Cover and cook on crock pot high for three hours then turn to low for
  at least six hours.
  
  I like to use the crock pot and leave it cooking on low overnight. I
  stir it about twice and sometimes find it necessary to add water. If
  it gets too thin, take about 1/2 cup of beans and mash with a fork
  until pasty to add back as a thickener. About an hour before serving
  stir in vinegar.
  
  I enjoy hot and spicy foods so I like to add the hot pepper (jalapeno,
  habanero or whatever you like) and Tabasco. If you don't like it hot,
  then leave them out or serve the Tabasco at the table.
  
  Serve beans and meat over rice. I have found brown rice to be quite
  tasty but white rice is fine too. Serve in a soup bowl and top with
  fresh chopped onion.

 Categories: Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Brisket
  1 1/2 lb Green beans
      6    Potato; peel/quarter
    1/4 ts Marjoram; crumbled
           Salt & pepper; to taste
 
     1-   Wipe meat and place in large pot. Cover with about 2 cups
  water. Vegetables may be added to the meat in a crock pot along with
  seasonings and the whole thing cooked 1O hours.  2-  In a dutch oven,
  simmer 2 to 2 1/2 hours before adding vegetables, then continue until
  potatoes are done.
    3-  In a pressure cooker, bring brisket, water and seasonings to 15
  # pressure and cook for 3O to 4O minutes. Reduce pressure under cold
  water, open cooker, add vegetables, cover, bring to 15# pressure and
  cook 5 minutes, reduce pressure again.       However you cook it,
  remove meat, slice  thinly on the diagonal, serve with green beans
  and potatoes drenched with  cooking liquid. Do not thicken the
  natural gravy. It has a lovely flavor and should not be greasy. If
  your meat is not well trimmed, remove excess fat before cooking.
  Should you have leftovers, heat the remaining liquid and slice the
  meat for open face or French dip hot sandwiches.

 Categories: Crockpot, Brownies
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    CANNING JARS,
           -wide mouth (See note)
      1 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
      1 c  SUGAR
    1/2 ts BAKING SODA
    1/4 ts GROUND CINNAMON (optional)
    1/3 c  BUTTER or MARGARINE
    1/4 c  WATER
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
    1/4 c  BUTTERMILK
      1    EGG, beaten
    1/2 ts VANILLA EXTRACT
    1/4 c  WALNUTS, finely chopped
 
   Well grease two 1-pint straight-sided wide-mouth canning jars; line
  the bottom of each jar with waxed paper. Set aside.
  
   In a small bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking soda and
  cinnamon, if desired. Set aside.
  
   In a medium saucepan combine butter or margarine, water, and cocoa
  powder; heat and stir till margarine is melted and mixture is well
  blended. Remove from heat; stir in flour mixture. Add buttermilk, egg
  and vanilla; beat by hand until smooth. Stir in nuts.
  
   Pour mixture into the prepared canning jars. Cover the jars tightly
  with greased foil. (Place greased-side down on each jar).
  
   Place jars in a 3 1/2, 4, 5, or 6-quart crockery cooker with liner in
  place.  Cover; cook on high heat setting for 2-3/4 to 3 hours or until
  cakes spring back when touched and a long wooden toothpick inserted
  near the centers comes out clean. Remove jars from cooker; cool 10
  minutes. Unmold cakes; remove waxed paper. Serve warm or cool with
  ice cream. Makes 8 servings.
  
   WARNING: Use only CANNING JARS for this recipe. Others may not be
  tempered to withstand the heat. Do NOT use coffee or vegetable cans
  as most contain lead and are painted or sealed with materials that
  may give off toxic gases when heated.
  
   aken from "Better Homes and Gardens New Crockery Cooker"
  
   This recipe doesn't say you can seal them up and store them in your
  pantry but my Kerr Canning book recipe says you can; here's how:
  
   Remove jars from the oven one at a time, wipe rim of jar clean; put
  on lid and ring and screw on tightly.
   Jars will seal as the cake cools. Store like canned goods.
  
   If you'll be giving these as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth
  (about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid) and put it on top
  of the lid, then screw on the ring. Make sure you screw the lid on
  very tightly. I like to use pinking shears to cut the cloth out with.
  I've posted a recipe for baking the jars in the oven, it's posted on
  the Sweet Bread topic.

  fat. Add chopped garlic, lightly brown in oil^^. Add chili powder,
  tomato sauce, bring to simmer. (I do all of this the evening before

      Title: CROCKPOT CHILI VERDE
 Categories: Pork, New_mexican, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Onion; coarsely chopped
      1    Bell pepper, green; coarsely
           -chopped
      4    Garlic clove; minced
      1 tb Olive oil
      4 oz Green chile, canned diced
      1    Jalape#o; diced (opt)
      7    Tomatillo
      2 lb Pork, lean; trimmed & cubed
      2 ts Oregano
      2 ts Sage
      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Red pepper flakes
    1/2 c  Beer
 
  First, saute one onion and one green pepper, coarsely chopped, with
  three or four cloves of garlic, minced, in olive oil. Throw into the
  crockpot. Also throw in a small can of diced green chiles. Depending
  on your propensity for spicy food, you may add from one to three
  jalapenos, sliced. Then, throw some tomatillos in the pot. How many?
  Well, when I got fresh ones in San Diego, I'd get seven or eight.
  Peel off the husk and coarsely chop.  Now that I've moved to
  Pittsburgh (don't ask me why), I've had to use canned ones on
  occasion. How many? Well, I don't really remember, it was one medium
  sized can, I think. Pay attention: I mean tomatillos, not green
  tomatoes.  The Frugal Gourmet substituted celery and tomatoes. I
  haven't forgiven him yet.
  
  Take about 2 pounds of lean pork (I trim off all the excess fat I
  can), cubed, and brown in the pan that you sauteed the onion, etc.
  in. Into the pot.  Now, the seasoning mixture. I prefer to grind up
  in my mortar oregano, some dried red chile peppers, sage, and cumin
  seed. Perhaps also some black pepper.  I almost never put salt in
  anything, so I probably wouldn't here either, but you may want to.
  How much? Well, about 2 tsp each of the oregano and the sage.  1 tsp
  each of the cumin seed and dried red peppers. Salt and pepper to
  taste. I probably will add a dash of beer (about 1/2 cup) for obscure
  reasons.
  
  This crockpots all day, or could be simmered for probably about 2
  hours.
  
  Traditionally, this is served in bowls, with hot flour tortillas,
  salsa, and cilantro.  You can also have sour cream, grated cheese,
  olives, and pickled carrots and jalapenos around. Of course, you wrap
  all this up in the tortillas, making killer burritos.
  
  I throw one twist into this, a technique that comes from carnitas.
  After cooking, I separate the meat from the broth, crisp the meat
  under the broiler, and reduce the sauce in the pan. This adds a great
  texture to the meat, and keeps the burritos from being too soggy.
  This is not what the original requester would want to do.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2 lb Whole chicken
      3 lg Onions -- peeled and
           Chopped
      5 lg Tomatoes -- chopped
      1 md Orange -- unpeeled, seeded,
           Ch
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
    1/2 c  Water
      1    Chicken bouillon cube --
           Crumbled
      3 tb Currant jelly -- red, or
           Raspberry
    1/4 c  Sweet sherry
 
  In a medium skillet, over medium high heat, heat the oil and saute the
  chicken, turning often, until well browned all over. Remove the
  chicken to a plate. Saute the onion in the skillet until well
  browned. Turn into the crockpot.  Place the tomatoes, orange, sugar,
  salt and pepper in the pot and set the chicken on top. Rinse the
  skillet with the water and scrape into the cooker. Add the bouillon
  cube. Cover and cook on Low for 5 to 7 hours. Before serving, remove
  the chicken to a deep serving dish and keep warm. Turn the pot
  contents into a skillet, set the heat to high and simmer until thick
  enough to mound on a spoon. Stir in the jelly and the sherry and
  cook, stirring until the sauce boils. Do not overcook, lest the sauce
  lose its shiny quality. If you wish, add some sugar or sweet sherry
  to further brighten the taste. If sauce is not shiny enough, bring
  back to a very brisk boil and quickly stir in some jelly. Pour sauce
  over the chicken.

  This recipe doesn't say you can seal them up and store them in your
  pantry but my Kerr Canning book recipe says you can; here's how:
  
  Remove jars from the oven one at a time, wipe rim of jar clean; put
  on lid and ring and screw on tightly.
  
  Jars will seal as the cake cools.  Store like canned goods.
  
  If you'll be giving these as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth
  (about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid or as large as
  you'd like) and put it on top of the lid, then screw on the ring.
  Make sure you screw the lid on very tightly. I like to use pinking
  shears to cut the cloth out with.

  last 1 1/2 hour,put in the rice. The final ingredient is about 1/2
  cup of white wine. You can add this whenever.  It is optional, of

  pepper. Enjoy! Mary Mann from Dallas

      Title: CROCKPOT RICE PUDDING WITH FRUIT
 Categories: Crockpot, Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/2 ga Milk; * see note
      1 c  Rice
      1 c  Sugar
      3 tb Margarine; solid
    1/4 ts Salt; optional
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Dried apricots or peaches; m
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 3:00 * Use half nonfat
  and half whole milk, or all nonfat for lower fat content.
  
       Substitute canned milk for the regular milk for a very rich
  flavor. The cooking time will vary greatly, anywhere from 1-1/2 to
  3-1/2 hours. The longer it cooks the thicker it will be.
       It is important to have the dried apricots minced. Put all
  ingredients into crockpot. Stir to blend well. Cover and cook on high
  1- 1/2 hours, stir once after about 1 hour. Or, cook on high for the
  first 30 minutes, turn to low and cook as long as you desire. Check
  after the first 2 hours of low cooking and stir. If rice is not
  absorbing the milk quickly enough, turn the crockpot up to high
  again. Keep cover on at all times.
  
       Crockpot temperatures vary widely among different brands. Only
  experimentation can tell you the correct amount of time for cooking
  in your crockpot. Rarely will a crockpot recipe fail, though, as the
  long, slow cooking process does not require precise timing.

  Take frozen turkey breast right out of the freezer........throw it in
  the crockpot usually adding a little bit of broth, some salt, pepper,
  and sage. If you are not trying to watch your fat content too closely
  you can just rub the breast with a thin glaze of butter or margarine
  to help the seasonings adhere. Cook on low all day until you get home
  and are ready to eat.  The result is turkey so tender it falls right

      Title: CROCKPOT-BARBEQUE BEEF OR PORK
 Categories: Bbq, Beef, Meats, Crockpot
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------JONI'S KITCHEN----------------------------
      4 lb To 6 lb Beef or pork or
           -a combination of both.
      2 pk Onion soup mix
      2    12 oz Bot's Chili Sauce
    1/2 c  Brown sugar:more or less
    1/4 c  Black molasses';about
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce;or less
      4 c  -water;to cover meat.
 
  In Crockpot on High, place cut up pieces of Beef and pork if you want
  to combine them, or just one or the other. I use what ever beef is on
  sale trim as much fat off as I can. Cut in large chunks put in Crock
  with 1 to 2 packages of onion soup mix. I usually use a good 4 to 6
  lb roast we like to freeze it. Use enough water to cover. You can add
  additional onions and celery to give it more flavor. And cook until
  fork tender. Remove from Crock, put meat on platter to cool, and save
  a couple of cups of the juice it was cooked in. Put into the crockpot
  the Chili Sauce, brown sugar, Molasses(optional) Worcestershire to
  taste. I do not like it too hot so I don't use more than a couple of
  tablespoons. Now take your meat on a board and start to shred it with
  a fork and paring knife, how ever it is easy for you, I don't like it
  to fine so do not use my processor. Just cut in pieces and shred, OK.
  Now put it back in crock and add enough of the juice it was cooked
  in, with the onions from the mix also, it adds to the flavor.Add just
  enough juice to make it moist, save some of the juice for as it cooks
  on simmer you may have to add some more. If you use for a cookout,
  you can keep it plugged in, and keep a check for moistness, when it
  gets a little dry just add some more juice. I use hamburger rolls. or
  bakery Hamburger rolls, or Kaiser rolls. What ever you prefer. It
  goes a long way. Left over's I put in little freezer bags or in the
  margarine containers,1/2 lb size, and freeze. Just enough for two
  sandwich's for lunch. This is from memory, so if you have a question
  or doubt<G> ask away. From Joni's Kitchen For Diabetics' I take a
  small portion and just add everything but the sugar and use Twin
  Brown sugar. Does very well.

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 c  Milk
      1 tb Butter
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 pk Dry yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water
  2 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
      1 c  Butter; cold
 
  COMBINE MILK, first amount of butter, sugar and salt in a small pot
  and bring to a boil over high heat. Immediately remove from the heat
  and let stand to room temperature. In the meantime, dissolve the
  yeast in the water and add it to the milk. Place the liquid in a
  mixer and add the flour. Using the dough hook, mix until the dough is
  elastic. It will be sticky. Place in a bowl, cover and let rise until
  double in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Place in refrigerator and chill
  for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, soften the remaining cold butter by
  pounding with a rolling pin. Roll the dough on a floured board to
  form a 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Spread the butter over 2/3 of the
  rectangle closest to you. Fold the unbuttered third over the center
  third. Then fold the bottom 1/3 over the doubled portion. Swing the
  dough around a quarter turn, that is, bring east to south. Roll it
  again into a 1/4-inch thick oblong. Fold again in thirds. Cover the
  dough and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours. When the dough is
  chilled, remove from the refrigerator and repeat the folding and
  turning twice more. Then roll the dough to 1/4-inch thickness again.
  Cut the dough into 3-inch squares and cut the squares on the bias to
  form two triangles. Roll each triangle beginning with the wide side,
  then shape the rolls into crescents. Chill for 30 minutes in the
  refrigerator before baking. Preheat oven to 400F. Bake for 10
  minutes. Reduce heat to 350F and continue to bake another 15 minutes.

           Yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water (105 to 115)
  2 3/4    To 3 cups all-purpose flour
      1 c  (1/2 pound) butter,
           Softened
      1    Egg yolk
      1 tb Milk
 
  Heat 1 cup milk, oil, sugar, and salt in a saucepan; cool to lukewanm.
  Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Add milk mixture and 1
  cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make
  a soft dough. Turn dough onto a floured surface; continue to work in
  flour until dough can be kneaded. Knead until smooth and elastic
  (about 5 minutes). Shape dough into a ball and place in an oiled
  bowl; turn to oil top of dough. Cover; let rise in a warm place until
  double in bulk (about 45 minutes). Punch dough down. Roll out on
  floured surface to form a rectangle about l/4 inch thick. Cut butter
  in slices (just soft enough to spread but not melted). Spread over
  center one-third section of rectangle. Fold each extending side of
  butter, pressing together the open edges to seal. Roll out again
  until rectangle is 3/8 inch thick. Turn dough occasionally, flouring
  surface lightly to prevent sticking. Fold in thirds again to make a
  squarish rectangle. Roll dough and fold again in the same manner.
  Wrap dough in waxed paper or foil; chill 30 minutes. If at any time
  dough oozes butter and becomes sticky while rolling, chill until
  butter is more firm. Roll and fold again 2 more times exactly as
  directed before. Chill dough again another 30 minutes. Roll dough
  into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Cut into strips 6 inches wide.
  Cut triangles out of each strip to measure about 6x8x6 inches. Roll
  up each triangle of dough from a 6-inch edge, pinching tip to seal.
  Shape each roll into a crescent. Place, point down, 1 1/2 inches
  apart on ungreased baking sheet. Cover; let rise until double in bulk
  (30 to 45 minutes). Brush each roll with mixture of egg yolk and 1
  tablespoon milk. Bake at 425F 15 minutes, or until brown. Remove from
  baking sheet and cool on wire rack. Serve warm.

           -custard filled(from the
           -bakery or home made)
    1/4 c  Icing sugar
 
  The Croquembouche pyramid must be assembled quickly, or the syrup
  used to assemble it will harden and have to be reheated. Therefore,
  be sure to read the recipe through thoroughly before starting to
  work. And have all ingredients near the stove, so you dip the puffs
  and set them in place quickly.
  
  Cut a 9-inch circle from cardboard, and cover with foil. Set the
  circle on a board near the stove.  Have the filled cream puffs close
  at hand.
  
  Cook corn syrup in the top of a double boiler over high heat until
  candy thermometer reaches hard-ball stage(240F), or until a small
  drop of the syrup forms a soft ball in coldwater. Set pan over
  boiling water.
  
  To build the pyramid, lightly dip the bottom oof a cream puff in
  syrup and set on the edge of the circle, syrup-side down. Repeat with
  9 more puffs, forminga ring. For the secong row,arrange a slightly
  smaller ring of puffs overthe spaces between the puffs in the first
  row, inclinin g the second row slightly inward. Fill in the center
  with more puffs for support.
  
  Continue building the pyramid in decreasing rings, filling in cent er
  for support as needed, until you have completed 8 rows.
  
  Top with one puff,. Sprinkles the Croquembouche lightly with 1/4 cup
  siftedicingsugar. To serve, lift one ortwo puffes at a time off the
  pyramid, starting from the top. Serves 8 - 10.
  
  Note: If syrup starts to thicken before puramidis completed,add a
  teaspoon of water and  stir over low heat. Do not let syrup burn.

  till dough is smooth. Butter and flour cookie sheets and drop by
  small teaspoonfuls 2" apart and bake 16 minutes until brown and
  puffed. Put a little slit in each one, put them back in oven for 10
  minutes more. Cool completely. Fill them from bottom with whipped
  cream. Refrigerate till ready to assemble. Make the caramel and pile
  puffs into a pyramid using caramel as glue - dip bottoms. Make th
  chocolate and dribble it over all. CARAMEL FILLING: Bring to a simmer
  ~ swirl pan till sugar dissolves.  Cover, bring to boil, when bubbles
  are thick, uncover and swirl till light brown - remove from heat.

  on the bottom of the pan.)  Cool slightly, and add eggs, one at a
  time, beating vigorously. Using a pastry tube with a 1/2 inch
  opening, form 1-inch-high mounds, 3/4 inch in diameter, on
  parchment-lined baking sheet. Glaze and smooth the tops.  Bake for 20
  to 25 minutes, until puffed and golden. Cool on racks. To make the
  mocha cream, beat the egg yolks, gradually adding the sugar, until
  mixture is thick and pale yellow.  Beat in the flour, Scald the milk
  and add in dribbles, reserving 1/2 cup for thinning. Return to clean
  pot and stir vigorously over high heat until mixture boils and
  thickens. If it seems too thick to pipe, add reserved milk. Remove
  from heat. Add the butter, 1 Tbsp at a time. Melt the chocolate and
  add to mixture with the expresso.  Just before assembling
  croquembouche, inject the cream into the puffs with a 1/4-inch pastry
  tip. To make the caramel, bring sugar, water, and corn syrup to a
  boil over high heat. Do not stir. Cover pan until steam dissolves any
  crystals. Uncover and boil 5 minutes, or until syrup is amber. Remove
  from heat. Dip the bottoms of the puffs, one by one, into the caramel
  and arrange in a pyramid Cut the tip from a balloon whisk, dip into
  caramel, and whirl strands of caramel around croquembouche to form a

      Title: CROQUEMBOUCHE (4)
 Categories: Desserts, French
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------PUFFS (PATE A CHOUX-------------------------
  1 1/2 ea Sticks unsalted butter
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      6 ea Large eggs

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1 ea Egg beaten with 1 tsp water
      1 ea Pastry Cream (Creme Patissie
      6 ea Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Sifted flour
      2 c  Milk, scalded
      3 tb Butter
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Cognac
      1 ea Pinch salt

MMMMM---------------------------NOUGAT--------------------------------
      2 c  Sugar
      1 ea Juice of 1/2 lemon
  1 1/2 c  Toasted finely ground almond

MMMMM--------------------------CARAMEL-------------------------------
      2 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Water
      2 tb Corn syrup
 
  Use Pastry Cream (Creme Patissiere) for filling. Preheat oven to 425
  degrees.  To make the puffs, melt the butter in the water with salt
  and sugar over low heat. Remove from heat and beat in flou with a
  wooden spoon until completely mixed.  Return to heat and stir
  vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes.  Mixture will form a mass, and a film
  will form on bottom of pan. Remove from heat and, one by one, add
  eggs, beating vigorously after each addition. Using a pastry tube
  with 1/2-inch opening, form puffs on a buttered baking sheet. Glaze
  each puff with the beaten egg and water, using a pastry brush Smooth
  the top of each puff. Put in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove from
  oven and pierce each puff with a sharp knife. (This allows the steam
  to escape so that the interior of the puff is not soggy.) Return to
  the oven for 10 minutes more. Cool puffs on a rack. While cooling,
  prepare pastry cream. To make the cream, beat the egg yolks,
  gradually adding the sugar, until mixture is thick and pale yellow.
  Beat in the flour. Add the hot milk in dribbles, reserving 1/2 cup
  for thinning. Return to pot in which milk was scalded, and stir
  mixture over high heat until it comes to a boil.  It will become
  lumpy first and then will smooth out with vigorous stirring.  Be
  careful not to scorch the bottom of the pot. The cream should be
  thick, bu add milk if too thick to pipe. Add the butter, 1 Tbsp at a
  time. Flavor with vanilla, cognac and salt. Cool completely. Inject
  the pastry cream into the puffs with a 1/4-inch pastry tip. To make
  nougat, melt the sugar with the lemon juice in a heavy pot. Do not
  stir. Boil together until a thick amber syrup is formed. Stir in the
  almonds and spread the mixture on an oiled marble slab while warm.
  Cut wit a sharp knife into a round for the base, and into small
  triangles for decoration. Keep nougat warm in a 250 degree oven. (It
  cannot be cut or shaped if it hardens.) To make the caramel, bring
  the ingredients to a boil over high heat. Do no stir. Cover pan
  (allowing steam to dissolve any crystals that might form). Uncover
  pan and boil several more minutes, until syrup is amber.  Reduce heat
  to keep syrup from hardening. Dip the filled cream puffs, one by one,
  into the caramel syrup and arrange on the nougat base, forming a cone
  resembling a pyramid.  The caramel holds the cream puffs together.
  Note: Assemble the croquembouche the day of the party, as it cannot
  be refrigerated. However, the cream puffs, pastry cream, and nougat
  can be prepared in advance.

      Title: CROQUETAS DE JAMON (HAM CROQUETTES)
 Categories: Appetizers, Cuba, Update
      Yield: 45 Servings
 
    1/4 lb (1 stick) salted butter
      7 ts All-purpose flour
      2 c  Milk, scalded
      2 c  Finely chopped cooked ham
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
      3 ts Fresh lime juice, plus
           -extra for sprinkling
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh parsley
      2 c  Very fine bread crumbs
      1 lg Egg, lightly beaten
           Peanut or vegetable oil for
           -frying
      1 ea In a large skillet over low
           -heat, melt the butter.
           -When it begins to
 
  foam, blend in the flour, then gradually whisk in the milk until the
  mixture thickens into a smooth paste. Do not overcook or it will get
  lumpy. Add the ham, salt, pepper, nutmeg, lime juice, and parsley,
  and continue cooking over low heat for 2 minutes, stirring constantly
  with a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat. 2. Spoon the mixture into
  a pan or platter and let it cool thoroughly. (After it has reached
  room temperature, it can be refrigerated.) 3. Sprinkle a light layer
  of bread crumbs on a work surface. Scoop up 1 tablespoon of the
  cooled ham mixture and shape it into a cylinder about 1 1/2 inches
  long and 3/4 inch in diameter. Dip it in the beaten egg and then in
  the crumbs, and repeat with the remaining mixture, renewing the
  crumbs when necessary. (The recipe can be prepared to this point one
  day ahead of time and refrigerated overnight.) 4. Preheat the oven to
  250 degrees. In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or deep fryer over
  medium-high heat, heat 2 to 5 inches of oil to 375 degrees, or until
  a drop of the mixture sizzles when it touches the oil, and fry 5 to 6
  croquettes at a time until golden on all sides, turning with a
  slotted spoon. Do not fry too many at once, or the oil temperature
  will fall and they will be soggy rather than crisp. Transfer them to
  a paper-towel-lined platter to drain, keep warm in the oven until you
  have finished frying the rest, and serve sprinkled with fresh lime
  juice. Makes 45 To 50 Croquettes Mary Urrutia Randelman "Memories of

  well mixed. Keep mixture in the food processor.
  
  In a heavy, 1 quart pot, combine couscous, tomato juice and red wine.
  Stir & bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover and simmer for 2-3 minutes
  until the couscous has absorbed all the liquid.  Let sit 5 more
  minutes. Add cooked couscous to chickpea mixture along with remaining
  ingredients except oil. Mix well, stopping the processor and scraping
  down the sides once or twice, until smooth.
  
  Lightly oil your hands. Shape 2 to 3 Tb of chickpea mixture between
  your hands to form a ball. Repeat with remaining mixture until you
  have 24 balls. Flatten balls to form patties about 2" wide and 1/2"
  thick. Brush croquettes with olive oil and place on a lightly oiled
  baking tray. Bake for 15 minutes, turn the croquettes over, brush
  with oil and bake another 10-12 minutes.
  
  These may be served in a sandwich, as an appetizer or as a main dish
  with pasta and tomato sauce.

MMMMM-----------------PASTA FROLLA ALLE MANDORLE----------------------

MMMMM-------------------SWEET DOUGH W/ALMONDS------------------------
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Ground blanched almonds
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 pn Salt
      5 tb Cold unsalted butter
      1    Egg

MMMMM--------------------FOR THE STRAWBERRIES-------------------------
      3 pt Ripe strawberries
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Strawberry jam
           Confectioners' sugar
           - for finishing
 
  Use a sharp knife to cut the crostata to keep the berries from
  toppling and lessening the elegant symmetry of the dessert.
  
  FOR THE PASTA FROLLA: Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix
  well. Rub in the butter until it is absorbed. Make sure the mixture
  remains cool and powdery and does not become pasty. Beat the egg and
  stir in with a fork. Continue stirring until the dough holds
  together, then knead it smooth, briefly. Shape into a disk, wrap in
  plastic and refrigerate at least
        1    hour, or until firm.
  
  FOR THE STRAWBERRIES: Rinse and hull berries. Choose the best ones to
  border the tart (draw a 9-inch circle on wax paper and arrange berries
  inside to see how many you need). Slice remaining berries into a
  bowl; add sugar and lemon juice. Toss to combine and cover with
  plastic wrap. Refrigerate the sliced and whole berries until ready to
  assemble the crostata. Preheat oven to 350F and set a rack in the
  middle level. To form tart base, roll three-quarters of the dough on
  a floured surface to a 9-inch disk. Transfer to a cookie sheet lined
  with parchment or buttered wax paper. Place a 9-inch disk, like a
  spring- form bottom, on dough and trim to a 9-inch diameter. Pierce
  the dough all over with a fork at 1/2-inch intervals. Combine the
  scraps with the remaining dough and roll it into a thin cylinder,
  about 30-inches long. Moisten the edge of the base with water and
  arrange the cylinder of dough on it, to form sides on the tart shell.
  Press the cylinder with fingertip to make it adhere and mark a series
  of diagonal lines on it with the back of a small knife. Bake about 25
  minutes, until the dough is an even golden color and feels firm when
  pressed with fingertip. Cool the tart shell on a rack on the pan.
  Place cooled shell on a platter. Spread bottom evenly with jam.
  Arrange a row of the whole strawberries inside the edge. Drain sliced
  berries well; pile in center. Dust with sugar.

      Title: CROWN ROAST OF FRANKFURTERS WITH BAKED BEANS
 Categories: Meats, Holidays
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3    (16 oz.) cans baked beans
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
    1/3 c  Packed dark brown sugar
      2 ts Dijon mustard
      3 pk (12 oz. ea.) frankfurters
           (about 21 total)
 
  Preheat oven to 400F.  IN a medium saucepan, combine baked beans,
  onion, brown sugar and mustard.  Stir until well mixed. Cook over
  medium heat, stirring occasionally, until beans are hot, 10 to 15
  minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, rinse frankfurters and blot dry with paper towels. Spear 3
  hotdogs together by pushing a toothpick horizantally thorugh upper
  third of franks. Repeat with remaining weiners.
  
  Place a 6-inch-tall 1 1/2 to 2 quart baking dish about 4 1/2 inches in
  diameter (such as a bean pot) on an ovenproof serving platter. Lean
  frankfurters, skewered ends up, around outside edge of bean pot. Tie a
  piece of kitchen string around center of franks to secure them in a
  circle. Remove toothpicks.
  
  Transfer hot beans from saucepan to pot in center of franks and place
  platter and all in oven.  Bake until weiners are golden brown and
  beans are bubbly, about 25 minutes. To serve, spoon beans directly
  form pot and use tongs to remove frankfurters.
  
  This is sure to be a kid pleaser at celebrations where adult food
  would not be appreciated.  I can remember, when I was a kid, my
  grandmother for New Year's Day celebrations would always serve
  Lutefisk - (which I hated - it just stood there on the platter - a
  gelatinous - fish smelling opaque mess that shook like a live
  jellyfish and we kids were expected to eat it). I would far rather
  have had hot dogs!

  roasting for 45 minutes.
  
     Sausage and Herb Stuffing:  In a large frying pan over medium-low
  heat, melt butter. Add onion and celery and saute, stirring
  occasionally, until soft, about 15 minutes. Add garlic and sausage
  and cook, stirring, until sausage is browned, about 10 minutes
  longer. Using a slotted spoon, transf sausage mixture to a bowl.
  Discard the fat in the pan.
     Add bread crumbs and egg to sausage mixture. Add enough chicken
  stock j to moisten the stuffing, then season to taste with salt and
  pepper. Mix we
     Mound stuffing in center of crown roast and return roast to oven.

  away from bone registers 150~ or a chop is pale pink when cut in the
  center, about 3 minutes longer. (Check periodically and cover the rib
  ends with foil if th brown before the meat is done).

  immediately, or store in an airtight container in the freezer for up
  to 1 year.

      Title: CROWN ROAST POTATOES
 Categories: Vegetables, Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    Baking potatoes (medium)
    1/4 ts Celery salt
    1/4 ts Onion salt
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
      1 ts The herb mix you are using
           -on the roast
 
  Now: Potatoes (around the roast)-- say, 4 servings. I know, you are
  two people but *I* eat like two people all by myself! If you really
  feel you both eat like birds-- halve everything for 2-3 servings.
  
  Diresctions:  Wash and peel the potatoes (you can just scrub them if
  you wish); cut potatoes lengthwise-- 8 wedges. Figure you add them 1
  1/4 -2 hrs before the roast is done; overlap potaoes as little as
  possible and dot with butter/margarine. sprinkle with the herbs and
  the onion & celery salts. Add a little ground peppper if you like.
  Check potatoes and remove when tender and be sure to turn and baste
  them with those great pan drippings once or twice while cooking!

  Allow to cool in the liquid. -- To serve, split the trotter in two
  the long way and roll in melted butter and dried breadcrumbs mixed
  with a pinch of allspice. Heat slowly under a broiler, or in the oven
  at 350 F, until hot and crisp on the outside. Serve with mustard and
  horseradish for those who like such things....and LOTS of wet wipes
  and paper towels. . Basic brine for trotters: . 12 1/2 cups water:
  3/4 lb sea salt: 3/4 lb brown sugar: 2 oz saltpeter (optional):  1 t
  juniper berries: small piece ungrated nutmeg: 1 bay leaf:  3 sprigs

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Brown sugar

  To quote the author, "If you use pat-in pastry to make a pie, you
  won't have a top crust. A crumb topping is a great substitute. Golden
  and crumbly, it looks irresistible, has a warm, buttery flavour, and
  is easy to make. It can used to make with any fruit pie and some
  others as well."
  
  Blend the sugar, flour and butter until crumbly, then add nuts.
  Sprinkle evenly over pie filling in the pie shell and bake as your
  recipe directs. If the crust topping starts browning before the
  filling is baked, put a piece of foil over it.

      Title: CRUMBLY SWEET PASTRY (PATE SABLEE) WITH ALMONDS
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter,
           Softened
      1 c  Plus 6 tablespoons
           Confectioner's sugar, sifted
      1    Egg
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 c  Ground almonds
 
  In an electric mixer, cream together butter and sugar until light and
  fluffy.  Add egg and salt and beat until combined.  Stir together
  flour and almonds and add to butter mixture.  Slowly mix just until
  flour is evenly moistened.  Do not let it form a ball. Remove dough
  from bowl onto a lightly floured work surface and form into 2 balls.
  Flatten each ball into a disk, wrap well, and refrigerate a minimum
  of four hours or as long as 4 days .
  
  Yield: 2 9 to 10 inch tart shells
  
  These two different pastry doughs have very different textures.  The
  first is flaky due to the incorporation of butter in small pieces: as
  the dough cooks, the butter melts and the water in it turns to steam
  and puffs up the dough.  The second dough is tender and crumbly: the
  butter is well creamed as for a cookie; the confectioner's sugar adds
  tenderness due to the cornstarch it contains; the ground almonds,
  which can be substituted for some of the flour in any pastry dough
  recipe, add an interesting graininess.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 qt Water
      2 oz Yeast
    1/2 lb Potatoes
    1/2 oz Salt
           Flour
 
  MUFFINS: Wash, peel & boil the potatoes, rub through a colander, add
  the water (just warm enough to bear the hand in it without
  discomfort); then dissolve the yeast & salt in it, & stir in
  sufficient flour to make a moist paste. Beat it well in a deep bowl &
  then clear off the paste from the hands; cover over with a clean
  cloth & leave it to rise in a warm place. When it has well risen, &
  is light & spongy, turn it out on the table, dredge over with flour,
  & then divide it off into pieces about 3 oz in weight, roll them up
  into round shapes, & set them on a wooden tray, well dusted with
  flour to prove. When light enough, see that the hot plate is hot, &
  then carefully transfer the muffins from the tray, one at a time,
  using a thin tin slice for the purpose, taking particular care not to
  knock out the proof or the muffins will be spoilt. When they have
  been properly cooked on one side, turn over with the slice & cook the
  other side. When the muffins are done, brush off the flour, & lay
  them on a clean clothe or sieve to cool. To toast them, divide the
  edge of the muffin all round by pulling it open to the depth of about
  1 inch with the fingers. Put it on a toasting fork & hold it before a
  clear fire till one side is nicely browned, but not burnt; turn, &
  toast it on the other. Do not toast them too quickly, otherwise the
  middle of the muffin will not be warmed through. When done, divide
  them by pulling them open; butter them slighlty on both sides, put
  them together again, & cut them into halves. Pile on a hot dish &
  send quickly to table. Time: 25 to 30 minutes to bake. Sufficient for
  about 2 dozen muffins. CRUMPETS: Proceed exactly the same as directed
  for Muffins (above), but stir in only half the quantity of flour used
  for them, so that the mixture is more of a batter than a sponge.
  Cover over, & leave for 1/2 an hour. At the end of that time take a
  large wooden spoon & well beat up the batter, leave in the spoon,
  cover over, & leave for another 1/2 an hour. Then give the batter
  another good beat up. This process must be repeated 3 times with the
  intervals. When completed, see that the hot plate is quite hot, lay
  out some crumpet rings rubbed over inside with a little clean lard on
  a baking tin, & pour in sufficient of the batter to make the
  crumpets. When cooked on one side, turn over with a palette-knife, &
  when done take off on to a clean cloth to cool. Muffins & crumpets
  should always be served on separate dishes, & both toasted & served
  as quickly as possible. Time: about 20 minutes to cook. Sufficient
  for about 2 dozen crumpets.

      Title: CRUMPETS ANYONE? INFO
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  From Womans Day Encyclopedia of Cooking, Vol IV pg 520
  
  CRUMPET--A small, patty-cake-shape, unsweetened, leavened bread made
  of flour, milk, butter, salt, yeast, and egg. The word comes from the
  Middle Eng- lish word for "wafer." Crumpet dough is stiff but can be
  spoon-beaten and spoon- dropped for shaping. Crumpets are cooked
  twice, first on a griddle until well risen and browned on both sides;
  then they are split and toasted to complete the cooking. They are
  served hot with butter and jam.
  
  The British dote on them for tea and, when away from home, they wax
  soulful at the thought of fresh, hot buttered crumpets eaten before
  an open fire. Although they are similar to their English-muffin
  cousins, crumpets are softer in texture with surface holes appearing
  during the pan cooking; these holes enable them to absorb great
  quantities of butter.
