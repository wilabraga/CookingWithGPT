      Title: CORNED TONGUE
 Categories: Beef, Jewish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Tongue, beef
           Water, as needed
      1    Salt, kosher; as needed
      1    Egg, in shell
    1/2 c  Sugar, brown, dark
      2    Bay leaf; crumbled
    1/2 ts Allspice, whole; bruised
    1/2 ts Peppercorns; bruised
      2 ts Coriander seeds; bruised
      1 ts Mustard seeds; bruised
      2    Garlic clove; peeled
 
  Select a ceramic, glass or enameled crock or bowl large enough to
  hold both the tongue and enough brine to cover the tongue by two or
  more inches. Be sure the container will fit in the refrigerator. To
  determine the brine quantity needed, enclose the tongue in a plastic
  bag and run cold water into the container to cover the bagged meat by
  two to three inches. Remove the tongue. Stir kosher salt gradually
  into the water, dissolving thoroughly each time, until an egg will
  float in it. (This will run about a cup and a half of salt.) Remove
  the egg once it's served its purpose and pour the brine into a pot.
  Stir all the other ingredients into the brine and bring to a boil,
  then simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Let brine cool completely.
  Remove the tongue from the plastic bag and prick it well all over
  with a skewer or larding needle. Return to the crock. Once the brine
  has cooled, pour it over the tongue. Cover with Saran, then add a
  plate (weighted, if need be) to keep the meat well under the surface.
  Cover the whole crock with Saran and refrigerate for 10 days to 2 1/2
  weeks (allow three days a pound curing time).  Turn the meat every
  few days, and be sure to keep it always sunk in the brine. To cook:
  Put the tongue in a pot with water to cover by several inches, two or
  three carrots coarsely chopped, a whole onion or two (peeled), a few
  tablespoons of vinegar, and simmer, partly covered, until the meat is
  very tender. Remove from the stock, and slit the skin and peel it
  away. Serve hot or cold.

      1 pn Salt
      1 c  Lard
      1 c  Cold water approximately
           FILLING:
      8    Ox cubed beef stew meat
      2 md Potatoes peeled & diced
      1 lg Finely chopped onion
 
  Pastry:
  
  Salt and pepper to taste Approximately 2 teaspoon cornstarch
  
  PASTRY:
  
  Combine flour and salt in a large bowl and cut in lard until mixture
  resembles fine bread crumbs. Add water slowly, a little at a time,
  until mixture binds into a soft dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and
  refrigerate at least an hour, a day or two is even better. There will
  be pastry left over which can be frozen, or make a pie while the oven
  is on for the pasties.
  
  FILLING:
  
  Mix together half the beef, half the onion, and one potato for each
  filling. Season to taste with salt and pepper and sprinkle mixture
  with 1 teaspoon of the cornstarch. When ready to make pasties, remove
  pastry from the refrigerator and prepare filling. Preheat oven to 425
  degrees. Roll out pastry as for pie crust and cut out two large
  circles 10 inches in diameter. Place filling in center. Brush edges
  of pastry with water and fold one half of circle over to meet the
  other, creating a half-moon shape. Press edges of pastry together
  lightly. Turn edges over about half an inch and crimp so it won't
  open during baking. Make two half-inch slits near the top of each
  pastry and place on a piece of baking parchment on a baking sheet.
  Brush the pasties with milk and bake 15-20 minutes. Reduce heat to
  375 degrees for about another 45 minutes, or until pasties are golden
  brown.

      Title: CORNISH PASTY
 Categories: Pies/pastry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -For the pastry:
      1 lb (by wt.) flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      8 oz Margarine/lard
           -about 6 T. ice water
           -milk for glaze
           -For the Filling:
      1 lb Lean, finely chopped beef
      8 oz Finely chopped potatoes
      1 sm Piece grated turnip or
           -swede turnip
      3    -4 T. cold water
           -salt and plenty of pepper
 
  Here is a recipe for Cornish type pasties...we lived there for several
  years and enjoyed them a lot! First make the pastry by sifting the
  salt and flour, then rubbing in the fat with the fingers until it is
  coarse like breadcrumbs.  Add enough water gradually to make a stiff
  dough kneading lightly with your hands until it is smooth. Wrap in
  cling film and chill 30 min. Trim the meat very well, taking out fat,
  bone or gristle, then cut into very small slivers.  Peel the veg and
  coarsely grate or chop and mix all together with about 3-4
  tablespoons water and season very well. Roll out the pastry on a
  floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick and cut into 4 circles about
  8 inches in diameter. Divide the mixture between the 4 circles
  filling only 1/2 of the circle. Dampen the edges with cold water,
  fold over to cover mixture and press with a fork or the fingers to
  make it secure.  Brush over with milk and make a small slit on top.
  Put onto baking sheet and bake in a hot preheated, 425 degrees for 15
  minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees for about 35-40 minutes. If
  getting too brown, the cover the top loosely with foil.

  Fitzgibbon (I took the liberty of 'translating' some of the British
  cooking terms and measurements)

 Categories: Breakfast, Side dishes
      Yield: 16 Cakes
 
      1 c  Water
  1 1/4 c  Plus 3/4C Milk
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
      1 c  Flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Butter - melted
      2 lg Eggs - slightly beaten
      1 ts Oil - optional
 
  Place water, 1 1/4C milk and sugar in heavy bottom medium saucepan and
  bring to a simmer. When liquid just comes to a simmer slowly sprinkle
  in cornmeal, whisking continuously, so no lumps form. Slowly simmer,
  stirring frequently adjusting heat as necessary to prevent
  splattering, until cornmeal is cooked and tender, about 4 minutes.
  Pour into large bowl to cool to room temperature; stirring
  occasionally to prevent skin from forming.
       Meanwhile, sift together flour, baking powder and salt in small
  bowl. Set aside.
       When cornmeal mixture has cooled stir in melted butterr and eggs,
  mixing until smooth. Stir in flour mixture. Stir in remaining 3/4C
  milk. Batter should be fairly smooth.
       Heat griddle over medium heat until water drops splatter. If not
  using non-stick griddle brush lightly with oil. For each pancake,
  ladle 1/4c batter onto heated griddle and cook until pancakes turn
  lightly puffy and a couple of bubbles appear on surface, (this type
  of pancake has few bubbles compared to regular ones) and underside is
  lightly brown. Turn and cook on other side.
  
  NOTES: Make sure cornmeal is completely cooked. To test, taste small
  amount to be sure it is tender and has no crunch to it. You could
  also replace half of melted butter with melted strained bacon fat.

  Here's a way to make the cornstarch paste called for in many of our
  recipes.
  
  Our recipes call for cornstarch paste as the thickening agent without
  specifying the exact proportions of cornstarch and water. This recipe
  is offered as an approximate guide until you find what works best for
  you. Some cooks prefer the thin paste, some prefer thick.
  
  Thoroughly mix together cornstarch and cold water. Always stir mixture
  again just before using because the starch settles.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Vanilla

      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate

MMMMM---------------------FOR BANANA PUDDING--------------------------
      2    Bananas, chopped

MMMMM------------------FOR BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING-----------------------
           Brown sugar instead of white
           -1 T extra butter
 
  Blend sugar, flour and salt.  Gradually add milk, mixing well. Cook
  and stir until smooth, thickened and clear. At this point, add any
  ingredients necessary for variations.
  
  Stir a little of the pudding into beaten egg, then return to pudding.
  (If you heat the egg too quickly, it'll cook a little. It's
  unsightly, but it'll still taste pretty good.)
  
  Add butter and vanilla, mix well, and chill in fridge. This is
  delicious hot, too!

      Title: CORNUCOPIA
 Categories: Christmas, Easter, Holidays, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 cn Soft-breadstick dough
      1 lg Egg, beaten with:
      1 tb Water

MMMMM------------------ASSORTED RAW VEGETABLES-----------------------
           Sugar snap peas, red and
           Yellow cherry tomatoes,
           Baby carrots, baby squash,
           Cauliflower and broccli
           Floretts.
 
  1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly spray a cookie sheet, at
  least 17"x 14", with non-stick cooking spray.
  
  2. Tear off a 30"x 18" sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil. Fold in 1/2
  to 18"x 15".  Roll diagonally to form a hollow cone, about 18" long
  with a diameter of 5" at the widest end (Cornucopia opening). Fasten
  end with clear tape.  Stuff cone with crumpled regular foil until
  form is rigid. Bend tail of cone up then down at end. Spray outside
  of cone with non-stick cooking spray.  Place on cookie sheet.
  
  3.  Open and unroll first  can of breadstick dough on work surface.
  Seperate breadsticks.  Begin by wraping one breadstick around tip of
  cone. Brush end of next breadstick with Glaze and press to attach to
  end of first breadstick.  Continue spiral-wrapping cone, slightly
  overlapping dough until there are 3 breadsticks left.
  
  4.  Pinch one end of the 3 breadsticks together, then braid. Brush
  bread around opening of Cornucopia with Glaze. Gently press on braid.
  Brush entire Cornucopia with Glaze.
  
  5.  Bake 45 minutes in preheated oven or until bread is a rich brown.
  (If parts start to darken too much, cover them with poeces of foil.)
  
  6.  Remove from oven and let cool completely on cookie sheet on a wire
  rack.  Carefully remove foil when cool. (If freezing, leave foil in
  bread for support. Remove when thawed.)
  
  7.  Fill Cornucopia with the assorted raw vegetables directly on
  table and let them spill out of opening
  
  NOTE-- To prevent this center-piece from absorbing atmospheric
  moisture, the baked Cornucopia cone can be sprayed with shellac or
  clear enamel. If treated in this manner, the Cornucopia will be
  inedible but can be preserved and re-used.

  1 1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/8 ts Black pepper
      1 c  Soft bread crumbs

           -egg substitute)
      1 c  Shredded emmentaler or other
           -Swiss cheese
 
  NOTE: You may use green peppers, but I like the way red and yellow
  ones look and they're slightly sweeter. Choose peppers that will
  stand without tipping over. -- Lee Bailey
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Slice off the stems of the peppers, and remove the seeds and
  membranes. Put the peppers in a pot of boiling water and boil for
  about 5 minutes, to soften. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, in a
  medium skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Saut the minced
  onion and celery until wilted, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a bowl
  and add the corn and tomatoes. Toss, then toss again with the salt
  and black pepper. Toss in the bread crumbs and then the eggs. Stuff
  the peppers, mounding the tops.
  
  Place in a baking pan containing about 1/2" of hot water. Top with the
  shredded cheese and cover with aluminum foil (oil the underside).
  Bake for about 1 hour, uncovering for the last 10 minutes.

           -hotter, if you like, with
           -ground ancho chilies or

  1 C pinto beans, soaked overnight and drained 1 lb tomatoes, fresh or
  canned, peeled, seeded, and chopped, juice reserved 3 ears corn
  (about 1 1/2 C kernels)
        1 t  cumin seeds 1 t oregano 1 inch piece of cinnamon
        3    cloves 1 large onion, cut into a medium dice 2 cloves
  garlic, finely chopped
        1 T  paprika 2 C bean broth or stock (If you make the stock
  yourself, she suggests one made with carrots, zucchini, onion,
  potato, parsley, garlic, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin
  seeds, cardamom pods, and salt.) 3 C pumpkin or winter squash, peeled
  and cut into 1 inch cubes 2 serrano chilies, seeded and finely
  chopped Cilantro or parsley, chopped, for garnish
  
  Cook the beans in water and 1/2 t salt for about 1.5 hours or until
  beans are tender. Drain and reserve the cooking liquid. Warm a small
  heavy skillet and toast the cumin seeds until their fragrance
  emerges; then add the oregano, stir for 5 seconds, and quickly
  transfer the spices to a plate or bowl so they don't burn. Combine
  them with the cinnamon and the cloves, and grind to a powder in an
  electric spice mill.
  
  Heat a wide skillet (with water or some sauteing liquid) and saute the
  onion briskly over high heat for 1 minute; then lower the heat to
  medium. Add the garlic, the spice, the paprika, and 1 t salt. Stir
  well to combine; then add 1/2 C reserved bean broth or stock and
  cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft. Next add the
  tomatoes and cook 5 minutes. Then add the pumpkin or winter squash
  along with another C of bean broth or stock. After 20 to 30 minutes,
  or when the pumpkin is about half-cooked -- soft but still too firm
  to eat -- add the corn, the beans, and the fresh chilies. Thin with
  the reserved tomato juice, adding more broth or stock as necessary.
  Cook until the pumpkin is tender. Check the seasoning, and add more
  salt if necessary. Serve garnished with the chopped cliantro or
  parsley.
  
  Even though there is corn in the stew, corn bread or tortillas make a
  good accompaniment.

      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      2    Lemons; grated zest only
      6 lg Eggs; separated
    2/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 lb Whole-milk ricotta
           Unsalted butter
           Flour for pan
           Confectioners' sugar
           Fresh fruit; garnish
 
  1. Heat oven to 325'F. Blanch lemon zest in boiling water briefly and
  plunge into cold water; drain well. Beat egg yolks, sugar and vanilla
  extract in bowl of electric mixer at high speed until thick and
  lemon-colored, about 3 minutes.
  
  2. Cream ricotta cheese in food processor fitted with metal blade
  until smooth. Gradually incorporate ricotta and lemon zest into egg
  yolk mixture, beating on low speed. Beat until smooth.
  
  3. Beat egg whites in bowl of an electric mixer at top speed until
  stiff but not dry. By hand, whisk 1/3 of egg whites into cheese
  mixture and combine thoroughly. Gently fold in remaining egg whites
  with rubber spatula. Do not overmix, but be sure that mixture is well
  blended and no streaks of white remain.
  
  4. Pour batter into buttered and floured 9-inch springform pan. Place
  pan in center of oven; bake until cheesecake is a deep golden brown,
  pulls away from sides of pan, and a toothpick inserted in center
  comes out clean, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack to
  cool.
  
  5. Once cooled, cover cheesecake with plastic wrap; refrigerate. (The
  cake can be made 1 day in advance.) To serve, release sides of
  springform pan, leaving cheesecake on pan base. Sprinkle top with
  confectioners' sugar and garnish with fresh fruit.

      Title: COTECHINO CON LENTICCHIE - FRESH SALAMI WITH
 Categories: Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Onion, sliced
    500 g  Lentils
  1 2/3 l  Hot water
      2    Cloves garlic
           Fresh mint
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Cotechno salami
           Olive oil
 
  Cotechino can be found in any good Italian delicatessen. Ideally,
  cook it with the lentils. However, like all sausages, it is fatty, so
  the instructions that follow are (sigh) healthier.
  
  In a little olive oil, cook 1 onion, sliced, until transpar- ent. Add
  500 g Lentils and 1.7 L hot water. Add 2 cloves garlic and some fresh
  mint. Cover the pan and simmer gently for about 1 1 1/2 hours or
  until the lentils are cooked and little liquid remains. Season with
  salt and pepper.
  
  Meanwhile, prick the cotechino in several places with a fine skewer,
  put it in a saucepan, cover with cold water and simmer slowly for
  about the same time (or follow label instructions). Tip the lentils
  into a serving dish, slice the cotechino thickly and arrange on top.
  Serve.

      Title: COTES DE VEAU FLAMBES (FLAMED VEAL CHOPS)
 Categories: French, Veal, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  By now, the only thing left of the side of veal is the chops, though
  fortunately you should have some left-over veal stock (it can be
  frozen as ice-cubes). Here is a very simple, low-fat recipe from
  Larousse Light French Cooking (McGraw-Hill.  1981) which is
  unfortunately long out of print.
  
  Beat together one egg yolk with half a tablespoonful of evaporated
  skim milk.
  
  Slice 375 g of mushrooms.  Measure out 30 ml of brandy or whisky.
  Juice half a lemon.  Have ready about 4 tablespoons of veal stock.
  Chop 2 tablespoons of parsley. Trim any fat From 6 veal chops and rub
  it over a large non-stick pan with a lid.  If there is no fat, brush
  on a little olive oil.
  
  Heat the pan and brown the chops on both sides, then add the stock.
  Meanwhile heat the cognac in a small saucepan, ignite it and pour it
  over the chops.  Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and
  cover.
  
  Cook just until the mushrooms have exuded their juices. Remove the
  chops to a warm serving dish.
  
  Reduce the cooking juices a little, then add a spoonful or two of the
  juices to the egg yolk mixture, stirring. Remove the frying pan from
  the heat and tip the egg yolk mixture into it, stirring. Return the
  pan to a very gentle heat and stir until the sauce thickens. It must
  not boil or it will curdle.  Add a dash of lemon juice and parsley,
  correct seasoning and spoon sauce over the chops.
  
  Larousse advises serving the chops with any dish of zucchini.

 Categories: Breads, Rolls
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 pk Yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water
      3 c  Smooth cottage cheese
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Warm water
      6 c  Or more flour
 
  Dissolve yeast in warm water till foamy. Heat till warm, the cottage
  cheese, sugar, salt, baking soda and 1/2 cup water. Add the yeast
  mixture and 1 cup flour and beat smooth with electric mixer.Gradually
  stir in by hand more additional flour to knead into a smooth , soft
  but elastic dough. Place in an oiled bowl, cover and let rise until
  double and light in volume. Punch down and shape into 24 pieces or as
  large or small you want them. Roll each piece into a ball shape.
  Place balls side by side in greased pan ( pans ) and let rise until
  light and double in volume in a warm place.Sprinkle tops of rolls
  with flour prior to baking for a bakery look. Bake in a preheated 350
  degree oven about 20 minutes or golden. I bring these to parties and
  bake in those disposable aluminum pans.
  
  Comment: I use small curd cottage cheese which blends more easily
  than the large curd and gives these rolls a wonderful flavor and
  texture.

 Categories: Pasta, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 lb Cottage cheese (may use
           -low-fat)
      1    Egg, lightly beaten

           -(optional)
           COTTAGE-CHEESE FILLING:
      1 lb Dry cottage cheese
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
           Salt
 
  Source: The Good Cook - Pasta, 1980 (Traditional Ukrainian Cookery)
  Serves: 6
  
  NOODLES:
  
  Dough: First mix flour with the salt. Combine the egg, milk and
  cottage cheese in blender.  Stir combination into the flour and salt
  and knead to make a soft dough. Cover and let the dough stand for 10
  minutes.
  
  Filling: In a bowl, combine the cottage cheese with the egg, and
  season to taste with salt. The filling should be thick enough to hold
  its shape in a spoon.
  
  Roll the dough quite thin on a floured board. Cut rounds with a large
  biscuit cutter or with the rim of a glass. For speedier work, the
  dough may be cut into 2 - 2 1/2 inch squares. Put a round or square
  of dough on the palm of your hand. Place a spoonful of the cheese
  filling on the dough, fold it over to form a half circle or triangle,
  and press the edges together with your fingers. The edges should be
  free of filling. Be sure that the edges are sealed well to prevent
  the filling from running out. Place the vareniki on a floured board
  or a kitchen towel (don't crowd them), and cover with a kitchen towel
  to prevent drying.
  
  Drop a few vareniki at a time into a large quantity of rapidly boiling
  salted (optional) water. Do not attempt to cook too many at a time.
  
  Stir very gently with a wooden spoon to separate the vareniki and to
  prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Continue boiling
  for 3 4 minutes. Vareniki are ready when they are well puffed. Remove
  them to a colander and drain thoroughly. Place in a deep dish,
  sprinkle generously with melted butter, and toss very gently to coat
  them evenly with butter. Serve in a large dish without piling or
  crowding them. Top with bread crumbs. The traditional accompaniment
  is sour cream or crumbled bacon, or both.
  
  An additional egg or egg yolk, or some thick sour cream, may be used
  in the filling if the cottage cheese is very dry.

      6 oz Grated carrot
      6 oz Fresh brown breadcrumbs

  Mince the meats fairly finely, grate the carrot and chop the onion and
  green pepper very finely.  Mix all the ingredients very thoroughly
  with your hands and season well with salt and pepper. Fry a small
  nugget to check seasoning and adjust to taste.  Oil a 2 lb loaf tin,
  line with greaseproof paper and oil again. Pack the mixture into the

  enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the loaf tin.
  Bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for 1 hour. Reduce temperature to
  325 F (160 C) gas mark 3, remove foil lid and bake for a further
       30    minutes.
  
  Cool the cooked meatloaf for 30 minutes, then tilt the tin and pour
  off the juices.  Set aside in a cold place overnight before serving
  to allow flavours to blend and mature.

           - cleaned and dressed
      2    Whole bay leaves
      2    Stalks celery (include tops)
      2 qt Water
      2 lg Yellow onions; peeled
           - coarsely chopped
      2 lg Sweet green peppers; cored,
           - seeded & coarsely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves
           - peeled and crushed
    1/4 c  Olive or other cooking oil
    1/3 c  Minced parsley
      1 c  Dried currants or raisins
      1 tb Curry powder
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      2 ts Salt
      2 cn (1 lb, 12 oz) tomatoes
           - with their juice
      3 c  Reserved chicken stock
      1 c  Toasted slivered almonds
           -(topping)
 
  REMOVE ALL BODY FAT from the cavity of the bird, then place the bird
  and giblets in a large kettle. Add the bay leaves, celery and water,
  cover, and simmer 10-to-15 minutes; remove the liver and reserve.
  Re-cover the chicken and simmer 1-to-1 1/2 hours or until tender.
  Lift the chicken from the kettle and cool, strain the stock and
  reserve. In the same kettle, stir-fry the onions, green peppers and
  garlic in the oil 8-to-10 minutes over moderate heat until the onions
  are golden. Add all remaining ingredients except the almonds and
  simmer, uncovered, 45 minutes, stirring now and then. Meanwhile, skin
  the chicken, remove the meat from the bones, and cut in bite-sized
  pieces; also dice the giblets and reserved liver. Add the chicken,
  giblets and liver to the kettle and simmer, uncovered, for 15
  minutes. NOTE: At this point, you can cool the mixture to room
  temperature, ladle into 1-quart freezer containers, filling to about
  1-inch of the top. Snap on the lids, label and date, then set in a
  zero-degree freezer and freeze until firm. The Country Captain can be
  made several weeks--even months--ahead of time. When ready to serve,
  place the blocks of frozen Country Captain in a large, heavy kettle,
  set over low heat, cover and bring slowly to serving temperature,
  stirring now and then, taking care not to break up the chunks of
  chicken. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Serve the Country Captain
  over fluffy boiled rice (you can cook the rice while the Country
  Captain reheats) then sprinkle each portion with some of the toasted
  slivered almonds. Makes 6 to 8 Servings

 Categories: Canning, Fruits, Harned 1994, Relishes, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  1 1/4 lb Parsnips
      1 lb Apples (3 md.)
           -peeled, cored and sliced
    1/2 lb Onions (2 md., abt. 1 cup)
           -peeled and chopped
    1/2 lb Ripe tomatoes (2 md.)
           -peeled and finely chopped
           -- (about 1 cup)
    1/2 ts Dried cracked ginger or
      1    1" piece dried whole ginger
      1 ts Mustard seed
  2 1/4 c  Cider vinegar
      1 c  Dark brown sugar; packed
      1 c  Dried currants (4 oz.)
           -- lightly packed
    1/2 c  Pitted dates (4 oz.)
           -- finely cut
    1/4 c  Crystallized ginger; packed
           -finely diced (abt. 2 oz.)
      1 ts Table salt
      1 lg Pinch cayenne
 
  The author writes: "This relish is based on a prize-winning English
  recipe of more than a generation ago. It is less sweet than
  traditional chutneys; most of its sweetness comes not from sugar, but
  from apples, dates, and parsnips.  I generally use Winesap apples but
  any well-flavored, crisp eating apple will do."
  
  Cook unpeeled parsnips 30 to 40 minutes in boiling water, to cover,
  in a saucepan or skillet wide enough to permit them to lie flat. They
  should be soft enough to mash. When the parsnips can be pierced
  easily with a fork, drain and cover with cold water until cool enough
  to handle. Peel and mash.
  
  Simmer the apple slices with 1/2 cup water  in a covered 1 1/2-quart
  saucepan for 12 to 15 minutes, or until soft enough to mash. Do not
  drain.
  
  Place the mashed parsnips and apples in a wide 4-quart saucepan. Add
  onions and tomatoes; tie ginger and mustard seed loosely in a double
  thickness of dampened cheesecloth or place in a metal tea ball and
  add to the pan, along with vinegar.  Bring to boil over medium heat
  and simmer slowly 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
  
  Add remaining ingredients and simmer 1 hour more, or until thick. Stir
  occasionally to prevent sticking. The chutney will darken
  considerably. Remove from heat and spoon at once into hot, sterilized
  half-pint or pint jars; seal.  Store at least 1 month before opening.
  
  Yield: About 7 cups.

      Title: COUNTRY HAM
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      1    Country ham (12-15 lb)
           - scrubbed,
           - soaked 1 to 2 days,
           - changing water after
           - 4 hours, then daily
     10 sl Ginger (size of a quarter)
      1 ts Peppercorns
    1/2 ga Apple cider
      1 ga Water
      1 c  Chunky applesauce
      3 tb Dijon mustard
      1 tb Prepared horseradish
      1 c  Dark brown sugar
      1 c  Bread crumbs
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Place ham in a large pan, fat-side up. Add
  sliced ginger and peppercorns, then add enough cider and water to
  come 2-to-3 inches up the side of the ham. Save remaining cider-water
  to add to pan as liquid evaporates. Cover and place in oven. Cook
  about 20 minutes per pound or until internal temperature registers
  160F. Remove from oven halfway through cooking and turn ham over.
  Replace and continue cooking. Remove ham to broiler rack and let sit
  10 minutes to cool. Remove skin and fat. Taste, and if it's very
  salty, it may safely be immersed in more apple cider and water to
  draw out more salt. Taste again and proceed. You may refrigerate
  until ready to glaze. Increase oven temperature to 400F. Mix the
  applesauce, mustard, horseradish, and 1/2 cup of the brown sugar.
  Spread over ham. Bake 20 minutes or until ham is heated through and
  sauce is bubbly. Remove from oven and turn on broiler. Mix together
  remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar and bread crumbs and spread on ham.
  Broil 5 minutes or until crisp.

  1 1/3 c  Warm Water; 110/115F degree
      4 tb Honey
      4 pk Active Dry Yeast
      8 c  Bread Flour; or less
      1 c  Cornmeal; not cornmeal mix
  1 1/3 c  Whole Wheat Flour

MMMMM---------------------FILLING FOR DOUGH--------------------------
    1/2 c  Country ham; minced and
           -fried until crisp
      1 lg Onion; White, 1/4" dice
    1/3 c  Chile Pulp;Anaheim, seenote
      6 tb Molasses
    1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg; lightly beaten
      1    14oz can of Yellow Hominy
      2 tb Oat Bran; dust on top
 
   seenote: Dried Chiles, reconstitute 6 to 8 Anaheim or Numex Peppers,
  scrape the flesh from the inside of the skin, discard the skin. using
  a sturdy fork mash the pulp until smooth. Use any other method for
  mashing chiles. NOTE,NOTE,    Use only recipe amount of this mixture.
   seenote: Hominy, drain 14 oz. can of hominy, rinse slightly and chop
  a little. Until the hominy is in 1/3 hominy size.....
    Lightly grease a baking sheet. Sprinkle with 1 tb cornmeal. Set
  aside.
   Chop the Ham and Onion separately, into small dice or large mince,
  fry the ham in a dry hot pan to crisp the edges of the ham. Remove
  ham from pan.
   Add onions to the same pan, stir over medium heat for 8 to 10
  minutes. Cook the Onions until golden brown, DO NOT brown until
  crisp. Mikenote: Pay attention to stirring at this step. NO crisping.
   Combine onions, ham, and hominy and stir to mix well, let this cool.
   In a 4 cup measuring cup, stir the honey into the water and sprinkle
  the yeast on top, stir until dissolved. Set aside.
   Use the dough hook for this project. In the mixing bowl of a heavy
  duty stand mixer, combine bread flour, 1 cup of cornmeal, whole wheat
  flour, molasses, vegetable oil, salt and egg. mix on low speed for 1
  minute. Add the water/honey/yeast mix, Onion, chopped Hominy, Ham,
  Chili Pulp, and enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough.
  Mix on low speed for 2 minutes. Knead on low speed, adding additional
  flour as needed, for 8-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and
  elastic and no longer sticky.
   Cover the mixing bowl and let rise until doubled, 1 to 2 hours.
   I usually freeze half of this dough for a later loaf. Divide dough
  into two balls, freeze in a non stick sprayed, gallon plastic bag.
  Continue this recipe with remaining dough.
   Punch down the dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough
  into a 14" circle, fold it in half, overlapping, slightly off center,
  so the top layer is set back about 1" from the bottom edge. With a
  sharp knife,or dough scraper, make 4 or 5 equally spaced cuts from
  curved edge to folded edge, about 2/3 the way across the loaf
  (cutting through both layers). Separate the cuts slightly so the loaf
  opens up and is crescent shaped. Place on the prepared baking sheet
  and let rise until doubled in volume, about 45
  minutes...............Preheat the oven to 375F degrees.
   Let rise in warm room for 45 minutes, place in 375F degree oven for
  45 minutes, or until it is nicely brown on top and the interior
  temperature is 200+F degrees.
   Remember this bread is fairly wet, and it will go against some of the
  rules of breadmaking. Use a flour sifter/duster to lightly flour the
  dough on the board if it seems too sticky to handle.
   Brush the loaf with the melted butter and sprinkle the remaining 1
  tb of Oat bran over the loaf. Bake for 40 minutes or until done.
  Remove to a wire rack and let cool completely.

 Categories: Pork, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea COUNTRY HAM, ANY SIZE
 
     SCRUB OR CUT OFF ANY MOLD THAT IS ON HAM WHEN PURCHASED. THEN
  RINSE IT WITH A MIXTURE OF EQUAL PARTS OF WHITE VINEGAR AND WATER.
  HANG IN THE HAM IN A COOL PLACE TO STORE IT. IF MOLD REOCCURS. THE
  HAM WILL CONTINUE TO AGE WHILE IT IS STORED. THE COOLER THE
  TEMPERATURE THE LESS IT WILL AGE.
     COUNTRY HAMS ALWAYS TASTE SALTY. YOU CAN REMOVE SOME OF THE SALT
  AND ADD MOISTURE BACK TO THE CURED HAM BY SOAKING IT IN WATER FOR 24
  HOURS. SALT CONSCIOUS PAOPLE SOMETIMES SOAK THEM UP TO 72 HOURS. IF
  YOU DO THIS, CHANGE WATER DAILY. THIS REMOVES SOME OF THE SALTY
  TASTE, BUT NOT ALL.
     COOK THE HAM ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRY HAM WITH BROWN SUGAR COATING
  DIRECTIONS.
     ONCE THE HAM IS COOKED IT WILL KEEP IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR UP TO 6
  WEEKS IF IT IS TIGHTLY WRAPPED IN BROWN PAPER OR ALUMINUM FOIL. DON'T
  USE PLASTIC WRAP AS IT HOLDS TO MUCH MOISTURE AND SPEEDS SPOILAGE.

    1/4 c  Brown Sugar
           Black Pepper
           Corn Meal
           Brown Sugar
 
  It is the custom in some parts of the U.S. to hang hams, after special
  processing, for several years, after which time, of course, they
  develop a heavy exterior mold.
  
  To prepare one of these old hams, soak it in cold water to cover for
  24 to 36 hours.  Then scrub it well, using a brush and yellow soap,
  if necessary, to remove the mold. Rinse thoroughly and place in a
  kettle of simmering water, skin side down.  Allow 20 minutes to the
  pound until the meat reaches an internal heat of 150. Add to the
  water before last 1/4 of cooking time:  cider and 1/4 cup of brown
  sugar.
  
  Drain when the cooking time has elapsed.  Remove the skin while the
  ham is still warm, being careful not to tear the fat. Trim the fat
  partially. Dust the ham with a mixture of black pepper, corn meal,
  and brown sugar.
  
  Put in a 425 oven long enough to glaze it.  If you want more of a
  baked quality allow the ham to reach an internal heat of 160 to
  165. Serve hot or cold.  Be sure to slice very, very thin.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2    To 3-pound chicken, cut
           -into serving pieces
      1    Envelope Lipton Savory Herb
           -with Garlic Recipe Soup Mix
      2 tb Water
      1 tb Olive or vegetable oil
 
  Here's a recipe that harkens back to one of culinary America's
  mainstays, Lipton Soup.  Along with hamburgers, "soup cooking" may
  well be the US' major contribution to the world's cuisines. I have
  not tried this yet, but I will.  It appeals to my red, white and blue
  lil' ol' heart... And how bad could it be with herbs and garlic,
  anyway?
  
  Preheat oven to 375F.  In 13 x 9-inch baking pan, arrange chicken. In
  small bowl, combine remaining ingredients; brush on chicken. Bake for
  45 minutes or until chicken is done.
  
  Makes about 4 servings.

      Title: COUNTRY PATE
 Categories: Appetizers, Pork, Meats
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Boneless pork, ground fine
           -twice
      1 lb Boneless veal, ground fine
           -twice
    3/4 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Brandy
      2 tb Oil
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 lg Onions, sliced thin
      2 sm Cloves garlic, halved
      1 lb Fresh pork fatback, sliced
           -thin
      1    Cornichon pickle for garnish
 
  Servings: Makes about 3 lbs From: Sallie Krebs
  
  DIRECTIONS: In a large bowl, combine the pork and veal. Mix the wine,
  brandy and oil with salt and pepper to taste, and pour the mixture
  over the meats. Scatter the onions and garlic on top. Cover the bowl
  tightly and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375-F. Discard the onions, but put the garlic
  through a press and knead it into the meats together with the wine
  mixture. Break off a small piece of meat and fry it in a lightly
  oiled skillet over moderate heat for 3 or 4 minutes, or until its
  juices run clear, without a trace of pink. Taste the piece and, if
  you like, add more garlic, salt and pepper. (Pork is unsafe to eat
  uncooked; do not taste the meats raw.)
  
  Slightly overlapping the slices, line the bottom and sides of a
  2-quart terrine mold or a 7 1/2 x 3 1/2 x 2 1/2 inch loaf pan with
  the fatback. Pack the meat mixture into the mold, and arrange the
  remaining slices of fatback on top of it. Fit foil over the mold, or
  cover the meat mixture with foil and a lid. To let steam escape,
  pierce a hole in the foil with a skewer. If you are using a lid,
  insert the skewer through its hole to puncture the foil.
  
  Set the mold on a rack in a large pan or dish. Place them all in the
  oven, and pour enough almost-boiling water into the pan to cover 2/3
  of the mold. Bake for 2 hours or until the pate shrinks slightly from
  the sides of the mold and the surrounding fat and juices are a clear
  yellowish white with no traces of pink. Or insert a meat thermometer;
  it should register 160-F when the pate is done.
  
  Take the pate from the oven, but leave the foil in place. Set the
  pate on a rack to cool to room temperature. Then put another pan with
  a heavy can or weights inside it, or even a brick, on top of the pate
  to compact the meats. Chill the pate thoroughly (overnight is best)
  with the weights in place. Before serving, cut the cornichon into a
  fan shape, slicing lengthwise through the pickle 4 or 5 times to
  within 1/2 inch of one end. Spread the slices into a fan, and garnish
  the pate with it.

      8 c  Milk
      3    Egg Yolks
      1 c  Whipping Cream (or 1/2-1/2)
      1 ts Chervil, dried
      1 ts Basil, dried
      1 ts Tarragon, dried
      3 tb Parsley, chopped fresh
 
       Nutmeg, salt, white pepper Saute onion in butter in heavy skillet
  until onions become soft and transparent, then add garlic and cook a
  few minutes more. Stir in the flour and cook for about 3 minutes
  more--careful not to scorch!  Pour the milk in and immediately wisk
  to blend. Add the herbs and bring to boil stirring to avoid lumps.
  Simmer for at least 15 minutes.  Season to taste with nutmeg, salt,
  pepper. Before serving, whisk the egg yolks into the cream then whisk
  the mixture into the soup. You can substitute milk for the cream if
  you want a lighter soup. * This soup is an excellent base for a wide
  variety of soups. I like to add fresh herbs and sometimes some cheese
  to the soup. Chopped ham, turkey, or chicken (leftovers), or any
  diced begetables can make an even meatier soup. If you add pureed
  vegetables you might want to reduce the amount of flour to keep the
  soup from getting too thick. * You can saute chopped vegetables
  separately and add right after the milk is poured in for wonderful
  vegetable cream soups.  Cabbage and Brussels Sprouts are two that
  work particularly well. * The original of this recipe is from
  Francois Kissel who had the Brasserie Pittsbourg in Seattle--an
  outstanding restaurant!

           Chopped
      1 md Carrot -- finely chopped
      3 tb Olive Oil
      1 lb Lean -- ground beef
      1 c  Chicken Or Beef Broth --
           (canned consomme is
      1 c  Dry White Wine
      4 c  Canned Peeled Italian
           Tomatoes -- roughly cut,
           Undrain
      1 sm Can Tomato Paste
      1 ts Salt
           Freshly Ground Pepper
      1 tb Oregano
      1 ds Red Pepper Flakes
    1/4 ts Nutmeg -- freshly grated
 
  In a small skillet or frypan, fry the bacon.  Drain off the fat as it
  accumulates in the pan.  Remove from skillet when bacon is leathery
  but not yet crisp. Distribute bacon on one or two paper towels, roll
  them up, and give them a good squeeze so the paper absorbs most of
  the remaining bacon fat.  Set aside.  Heat the oil in a deep, heavy
  non-aluminum kettle (an enameled cast iron casserole or large skillet
  will do) and add the vegetables.  Cook, stirring, over low heat until
  the onions are translucent and the vegetables are softened. Add the
  beef, using a wooden spoon to break up any lumps. Cook only until the
  meat loses its raw red color. Do not let it brown.  Add the cooked
  bacon, broth, and wine, raise the heat, and cook until the sauce
  thickens a little. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper,
  oregano, pepper flakes, and nutmeg, and stir well. Taste and adjust
  the seasonings. When the sauce begins to bubble, lower the heat and
  simmer very slowly, partly covered, for about 4 hours. Stir
  occasionally to prevent sticking. Before serving, taste again for
  seasoning and adjust.
  
  This sauce freezes well and keeps for about a week in the
  refrigerator. If you cannot find lean ground beef, pick out a round
  steak or some sirloin and have the butcher trim and grind it for you.

      Title: COUNTRY-STYLE GREENS
 Categories: Creole, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 bn Fresh collard, turnip, or
           -mustard greens
      1 tb Lard or rendered bacon fat
      1 md Onion, minced
    1/4 lb Smoked slab bacon or ham *
      2 c  Water
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper, to taste
        ds Of Louisiana-style hot sauce
 
  * cut in 1/2-inch dices or 1/2 pound ordinary sliced bacon or ham
  
  Contrary to rumor, greens do not need hours of boiling in a sea of
  liquid, as this Mississippi recipe proves. What they do need,
  however, is the flavor of smoked slab bacon or ham; if you must
  substitute ordinary bacon or ham, you'll need twice as much.  Greens
  are the traditional accompaniment to pork or ham; they also pair up
  well with corn bread or candied yams.
  
  1.  Trim away and discard the tough stems of greens. To loosen grit,
  place the leaves and the remaining tender stems (you should have
  about 2 quarts) in a large bowl, cover with lukewarm water, and soak
  for 5 minutes. Rinse several times in lukewarm water to wash away any
  remaining sand.
  
  2.  Melt lard in a large, heavy, nonreactive pot with a lid. (Do not
  use an aluminum pot; if possible, use one with an enamel coating.)
  Add onions and bacon. Fry together over medium-high heat, stirring
  often, until onions wilt and bacon starts to brown (about 5 minutes).
  
  3.  Add greens and the water and bring to a boil over high heat.
  Cover, lower heat to medium, and cook until greens are tender, with
  just a little crunch (about 20 minutes).
  
  4.  Uncover, raise heat to high, and boil off some of the excess water
  (about 5 minutes).  Add salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste, and
  serve hot (dish should be slightly soupy).
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: COURGETTE 'MEATBALLS'
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------MEATBALLS------------------------------
  1 1/4    Courgettes
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Fresh hot green chilli,
           -finely chopped
      3 tb Finely chopped onion
    1/2 ts Peeled and very finely
           -grated fresh ginger
      2 tb Finely chopped fresh green
           -coriander
  1 1/2 oz Graham flour
           Vegetable oil 4 deep frying

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      5 tb Vegetable oil 4 deep frying
      2 md Onions, peeled and very
           -finely chopped
    1/4 ts Ground tumeric
   1/16 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 ts Ground cumin seeds
      2 ts Ground coriander seeds
    1/2 lb Tomatoes (about 2 tomatoes)
           -peeled and finely chopped
      8 fl Single cream
    1/2 ts Garam masala
    1/2 ts Ground roasted cumin seeds
    1/3 ts Salt
 
  Wash, trim and grate the courgettes.  Put them into a bowl and
  sprinkle them with the salt.  Set them aside for 1/2 hr. Squeeze as
  much liquid as possible our of the courgettes by pressing handfuls
  between your two palms. Save this courgette liquid for the sauce. Dry
  off the bowl and put the courgettes back in it.  Add the chopped
  chilli (you may want to use more than 1 chilli depending on your
  taste - i use about 4 hot ones!), onion, ginger and coriander.  Sift
  the gram flour over this vegetable mixture. Mix well and form 16 neat
  balls (i find throwing them from one hand to the other is easiest).
  In a frying pan, wok or other utensil for deep frying, heat about
  1.5" /4cm of oil over a medium flame (a wok should have 1.5"/4cm at
  its centre). When hot, put 5 or 6 of the balls, or as many as the
  utensil will hold easily in one layer. Fry for about 1.5 min.s, or
  until the balls turn a rich, reddish-brown colour. Turn the balls
  every now and then as they fry. Remove them with a slotted spoon when
  they are done and leave to drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.
  Do all the 'meatballs' this way.
  
  To make the sauce, remove 5 tbsp of the oil used in deep frying and
  put this in a 10"/25cm frying or saute pan. Heat the oil over a med.
  flame. When hot, put in the onions. Stir and fry for 7 - 8 min.s or
  until the onions begin to turn brown at the edges.  Take the pan off
  the heat for a couple of sec.s and add the tumeric, cayenne, ground
  cumin and ground coriander. Stir once and put the pan back on the
  fire. Stir for another 5 sec.s and then add the chopped tomatoes.
  Stir and fry on med. heat for 5 min.s.  Add the courgette juice (you
  need 8 fl oz, if you have less, add some water).  Bring to the boil.
  Cover, lower heat and let the sauce simmer for 15 min.s (this much of
  the recipe may be prepared several hours ahead of time). Add the
  cream, garam masala, ground roasted cumin and the salt. Mix well,
  bring to a simmer and cook for 1 min. Now put in the 'meatballs'.
  Spoon the sauce over them. Cover and simmer very gently for 6 - 7
  min.s. Spoon the sauce over the 'meatballs' a few times during this
  cooking period.
  
  These 'meatballs` turn very soft when cooked in the sauce, so handle
  them gently and serve immediately.
  
  Makes 16 'meatballs' and serves 4(normal) - 6(feather-weights).

 Categories: Barry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Courgettes
      2 oz Butter
      2    Eggs
      2    Spring Onions (optional)
        pn Majoram
        pn Thyme
        pn Salt
        pn Black Pepper
 
  Wash and trim the courgettes and cut them into slices about half an
  inch thick. Melt half the butter in a pan and cook the courgettes in
  it gently for about 10 minutes, until they become just soft but not
  pulpy. Put them in a food processor. Put the remaining butter into
  the pan, break in the eggs and soft scramble them. Add a couple of
  trimmed and chopped spring onions, if liked, and mix them in with the
  scrambled eggs. Add the eggs to the courgettes in the food processor
  with the majoram and thyme and a genorous seasoning of salt and
  pepper - otherwise this can be a very bland dish. Process for a few
  seconds, scrape the sides down and process again. The end result is a
  beautiful gold and green flecked puree. If you are not using a
  processor, mash everything together with a fork really well. Pour the
  puree into a souffle dish and chill for two hours until the butter
  and eggs have set. This pate remains soft, so you can cut it with a
  spoon. but it is also spreadable, deliciously light and delicate.

 Categories: Vegetables, Vegan
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    450 g  Courgettes; coarsely grated
           Olive oil for frying
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
      4 tb Parsley, chopped
      3 tb Crotons (see below)
           Salt and pepper

MMMMM--------------------------CROTONS-------------------------------
           Thin slices of bread
           -(day-old, not fresh)
           Vegetable oil for frying
 
  Grated courgettes make a delicious dish tossed in olive oil with
  garlic and parsley. Topped with crunchy crotons, all this needs to
  complement it is some fresh bread and a crisp side salad.
  
  Toss the grated courgettes in the olive oil until just tender and very
  lightly browned. Add the garlic and parsley and heat through. Season
  with salt and pepper. Cook for a further 1-2 minutes and serve at
  once, sprinkled with crotons.
  
  To make the crotons, cut the crusts off the bread and cut the slices
  into tiny cubes. Heat the oil in a frying-pan - put in a generous
  amount since the bread soaks it up liberally! Toss the bread dice in
  the oil, turning until they are golden all over, and crisp. Remove
  from the pan with a slotted spoon, and dry on paper towels.
  
  For garlic crotons add a little crushed garlic to the oil before
  frying.
  
  For special occasions, try cutting the bread into different shapes:
  heart-shaped or tiny triangles, for example.

  topping of grated cheese, make a wonderful combination with sliced
  courgettes.
  
  Saut the courgettes in the butter or sunflower margarine until

 Categories: Vegetarian, Low fat, Salads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    250    Grammes (about 1 cup)
           Cous-cous
      2    Beef tomatoes
        sm Bunch spring onions
           (scallions)
      1    Tin red kidney or other
           Beans
      1 sm Tin sweetcorn
    1/2    Red sweet (bell) pepper,
           Chopped
           Lemon juice
    1/2 tb Olive oil (optional)
           Seasoning
 
  Soak the cous-cous in about double its volume of boiling water, until
  all the water is absorbed.  Peel and chop the tomatoes and onions,
  and drain the sweetcorn and beans (you will probably want to rinse
  the latter). Mix everything together, season and dress with lemon
  juice, and possibly 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil for the flavour - it
  makes so much salad that it really doesn't up the % CFF too much.

      Title: COUSCOUS
 Categories: Lamb, Moroccan
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Dried chickpeas
      3 tb Olive oil
      2 lb Lean, boneless lamb shoulder
    1/2 c  Chopped white onions
      5 c  Boiling water
      3 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/2 c  Ripe tomatoes
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
      1    Bay leaf
      2 ts Crushed dried mint
      1 ts (scant) salt (or to taste)
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      4    Medium-sized carrots
      3 sm Turnips
      2 c  Couscous
      3 sm Zucchini
      2    Italian sweet peppers
 
  1.  Soak the chickpeas overnight in four times their volume of water
  in a noncorrisble bowl.
  
  2.  Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed 5- to 7-quart pot.
  
  3.  Cut the lamb into 1-inch cubes.  Brown them (in batches, if
  necessary) on all sides over moderate heat. Transfer the meat to a
  warm platter.
  
  4.  Reduce the temperature to low and saute the onions for 2 minutes,
  stirring frequently.
  
  5.  Add the lamb, boiling water, lemon juice, tomatoes, cinnamon,
  nutmeg, bay leaf, mint, salt, and pepper. Stir, cover, and simmer the
  mixture vfor 20 minutes.
  
  6.  Drain the chickpeas and stir them into the lamb mixture. Simmer
  the ingredients, covered, for 45 minutes.
  
  7.  Begin this step 5 minutes before step 6 is completed. Peel the
  carrots and turnips.  Cut the carrots into 3/4-inch long segments and
  the turnips into 3/4-inch cubes.  When step 6 is completed, stir
  these ingredients into the pot containing the lamb. Simmer, covered,
  for 15 minutes.
  
  8.  Begin this step as soon as the carrots and turnips start
  simmering in step 7.  Put the couscous pellets in a 2- to 3-quart
  pan. Pour cold tap water into the pan until it reaches a depth of 1
  inch above the pellets. Soak the pellets for 10 minutes.
  
  9.  Pour the couscous into a sieve, discarding the water. Return the
  couscous to its soaking pan.  Slowly strain two cups of the broth
  from the large pot into the couscous. Bring this mixture to a simmer.
  Cover, and cook for 5 minutes over low heat.
  
  10.  Slice the zucchini into 3-inch cuves and the peppers into 1/4
  inch-thick rings.  When step 7 is completed, stir in both ingredients
  and simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 minutes.
  
  11.  It should be time to turn off the heat under the simmering
  couscous pellets as soon as the zucchini-and-pepper mixture starts
  simmering in step 10.  Fluff the pellets, cover the pan, and let it
  stand for 8 minutes. Then pour off any remaining liquid.
  
  12.  Mound the couscous pellets in the center of a warm, large serving
  platter.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat and vegetables from
  the pot and neatly arrange them around the mound.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

      Title: COUSCOUS & GROUND TURKEY
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -==========================
           -(serves 4)
 
  Ingredients:
  
  1 lb      of ground turkey dash(es) of ground allspice dash(es) of
  ground cinnamon 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped carrots, sliced
  lenghtwise, and ~3 in long green onions asparagus butter olive oil 5+
  cups prepared couscous
  
  Double Mustard Sauce:
  
  I made this by making up a thick white sauce, replacing about 1/2 the
  milk with a grey mustard, and adding mustard powder to taste. I then
  adjusted the thickness with milk. Brown the meat, and add spices to
  taste.
  
  Steam the veggies, then saute briefly in butter and oil.
  
  I found the timing worked best if I started the couscous and sauce
  ahead of time, then did the meat and veggies almost simulatneously,
  since they both go fairly quickly.
  
  Serve by putting a bed of couscous on the plate, pour a line of sauce
  down the center, and meat over the sauce. The veggies go on either
  side of the plate.
  
  I think I ended up using between one and two cups of couscous
  (cooked) per serving.  Depends on how hungry you are I guess.

      Title: COUSCOUS (1)
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -============
 
  Ingredients: 2 lb of couscous 1 cup chick peas (soaked) 1 chicken 1
  lamb shoulder 1 onion 4 carrots 2 turnips 1 bunch of coriander leaves
  1 pinch of ground saffron 1 pinch of ground cinnamon 1-2 tsp of
  harissa sauce 1 lb of pumpkin 2 red bell peppers 4 small tomatoes 5
  small zucchini water Harissa sauce: Soak a few dried hot chilies in
  cold water for an hour. Split the chilies and remove the stems and
  seeds. Pound in a mortar with 2 or 3 tablespoons of caraway seeds, a
  garlic clove and some coarse salt until it forms a paste.  Mix in
  enough olive oil to make the paste fluid. Refrigerate. Spread 2
  pounds of couscous on a tray and sprinkle with enough water to
  moisten them. Rake through the couscous with your fingers until all
  are moistened.  Let sit for about 15 minutes, then rake through them
  again. Continue sprinkling with water and rubbing the pellets between
  your palms until all are saturated and have doubled in size.
  
  Drain 1 cup chick peas that have soaked in water overnight, and
  simmer them in fresh water for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until they are
  tender. Drain and setr aside.  Cut up a chicken and a lamb shoulder
  into large pieces. Chop an onion.  Peel 4 carrots and 2 turnips and
  cut them into large chunks. Rinse a bunch of coriander leaves.
  
  Fill the bottom section of a couscoussier about halfway with cold
  water and drop in the prepared meat, vegetables and coriander leaves.
  Add a pinch each of ground saffron and cinnamon, and stir in a
  teaspoon or two of harissa sauce.
  
  Bring the water slowly to a boil; remove any scum from its surface
  and cook the stew at a bare simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes.
  Heap the couscous lightly in the top section of the couscoussier. Set
  the top section on the lower one and cover the couscoussier with its
  lid.
  
  Raise the heat so the liquid boils and produces steam to cook the
  couscous. After about 30 minutes, the pellets will lump together. To
  separate them, lift off the top section, leaving the stew to cook in
  the bottom. Tip out the couscous onto a tray.  Sprinkle cold water
  over the couscous. Gently rake through pellet with your fingers to
  break up any lumps. Set aside.
  
  Peel and slice 1 pound of pumpkin into chunks.  Cook them separately
  as not to over cook them.  Put the pumpkin chunks into a small pan
  and cover them with liquid ladled from the stew. Set pan aside.
  
  Broil 2 red bell peppers until the skins blister.  Let cool, covered
  by a damp cloth, then peel and seed them. Immerse 4 small tomatoes in
  boiling water; peel halve and seed them. Cut 5 small zucchini into
  large pieces. Add these vegetables to the stew.
  
  Return the couscous to the top section of the couscoussier, replace
  the top section on the lower one. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the
  peppers and zucchini are tender and the couscous is soft and fluffy.
  Meanwhile, simmer the pumpkin gently for 10 to 15 minutes until
  tender.
  
  To serve, pile the couscous on a serving platter, arrange the meat and
  vegetables on top and around the couscous. Ladle broth over. Serve
  with the rest of the broth and harissa sauce.

           -(4 servings)
 
  Ingredients:
  
  1 lb      Ground turkey 2-3 medium-small carrots 4-6 cups cooked
  couscous 1 cup     double mustard sauce asparagas butter or olive oil
  cinnamon ground allspice Sorry, but a lot of this is very approximate.
  
  Brown the turkey, drain, add spices to taste and mix, simmer 2-3 min.
  For me "to taste" is uasually about 1/8th tsp. allspice, 1/4-1/3 tsp
  cinnamon.
  
  Cut the veggies into ~3" pieces, slice the carrots into 1/4s length
  wise. Steam the veggies, then saute briefly in olive oil or butter.
  
  Double mustard Sauce:
  
  A standard thick white sauce, with 1/2 the normal amount of milk
  replaced the same amount of grey mustard, plus about 1 Tbs. mustard
  powder (adjusted to taste, of course.)
  
  Spread couscous (1 to 1 1/2 C) on a plate, dribble mustard sauce in a
  think line down the center.  put the ground turkey over that. Veggies
  go on either side of the plate, and your ready to eat.

      Title: COUSCOUS PANCAKES
 Categories: Breakfast, Pancakes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Couscous
      1 tb Couscous
      6 tb All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 ts Ground coriander
    3/4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/4 ts Ground white pepper, or to
           -taste
      3    Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 c  Milk
  1 1/2 tb Melted unsalted butter, plus
           -additional for cooking the
           -pancakes
 
  This is a light dish from "What's for Dinner" by Michael Roberts
  (Morrow) that is worthy of main-course status. Top them with
  ratatouille or grilled vegetables.
  
  Combine the couscous, flour, coriander, baking powder and 1/4
  teaspoon each of the salt and pepper in a bowl. Add the eggs and
  milk, mixing well. Stir in the butter, cover and set aside to rest
  for 20 minutes.
  
  To cook the pancakes: Place an 8" skillet over medium heat and brush
  with a little melted butter. Stir the batter to recombine. Then spoon
  2-3 tablespoons of batter per pancake into the skillet, making 3
  pancakes at a time. Cook until bubbles rise to the surface of the
  pancakes and break, about 1-2 minutes. Using a spatula, flip the
  pancakes and cook for 2 minutes. Remove pancakes from the skillet,
  cover and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, using as
  little butter as possible without allowing the pancakes to stick to
  the bottom of the pan.
  
  To serve, warm the pancakes in a hot oven, if necessary. Arrange the
  pancakes on individual plates, and mound the ratatouille or grilled
  vegetables next to them. Spoon any vegetable juices around, and serve

      Yield: 30 Patties
 
     10 oz Couscous
      6    Green chillies
      1    1" piece of ginger
           Salt; to taste
      2 ts Vegetable oil
      1 ts Mustard seeds
    1/2 c  Urad dahl
      3    Dry red chillies
           Curry leaves (2-3 sprigs)
      2 tb Coconut (optional)
 
  Save about 2 tsp of urad dahl and soak the rest of the urad dahl in
  water for about an hour. After an hour, grind the urad dahl, green
  chillies and ginger to the consistency of pancake batter and keep
  aside. In a pan, heat the 2 tsp veg oil and add the mustard seeds, 2
  tsp urad dahl (that was saved), the curry leaves and the red chillies
  (after cutting them into fine pieces). When the mustard seeds start
  spluttering and the urad dahl starts turning golden brown, add 3 1/2
  cups of water and the urad dahl batter, mix well and close the pan.
  When the water starts boiling, add salt. (The batter already added
  will tend to form clusters- Don't worry - Can be fixed later) Add the
  couscous and mix thoroughly (use a potato masher and get rid of any
  clusters by mashing them well). After the mixture has solidified,
  (This should not take more than 5-10 minutes) take the pan out of the
  heat and let cool. After the mixture has cooled, take a small portion
  of the mixture and make into a patty and set aside. (You can use some
  water and/or oil to make the patties if the batter is too sticky) The
  amounts mentioned in this recipe should yield about 30 patties. Serve
  with sphaghetti sauce or any spicy chutney.

  and tender, about 10 minutes.  Slip the garlic cloves from their
  skins and trim the tough ends.
  
  In a blender or food processor, combine lemon juice, olive oil,
  mustard, sugar and the roasted garlic; blend until smooth. Season
  with salt and pepper.
  
  Fluff the couscous with a fork.  Add scallions, parsley and the diced
  tomatoes.  Drizzle with the lemon dressing and toss lightly to coat.
  Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve within 2 hours.

      Title: COUSCOUS WITH SPICY CHICK PEA STEW
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      3 c  Couscous
    1/4 c  Olive Oil
      2    Onions Chopped
      3 md Carrots Sliced
      2 ts Each Ground Cinnamon,
           Ground Cumin,
           Ground Coriander
    1/2 c  Corn Kernels
    1/2 lb Zucchini Diced
  1 1/3 c  Dried Chick Peas Cooked
           OR
      2 cn (14-Oz) chick peas, drained
      1 qt Water
    1/4 c  Tomato Paste
  2 1/2 c  Warm Water
           Freshly Ground Black Pepper
 
   1.  Spread Couscous Out on a Large Deep Plate and Pour the Warm Water
  Evenly Over It.  Then Rub the Couscous Lightly With Your Fingers To
  Separate the Grains. Set the Plate Aside. 2. Heat Half the Oil in a
  Large Saucepan, add the Onion and Carrots and Saute Gently for 10
  Minutes. Stir in the Spices and Cook for a Further 2-3 Minutes,
  Stirring. 3. Stir in the Corn, Zucchini and Chick Peas (May Use Fava
  Beans instead). Then add the Water and Tomato Paste.  Bring To a
  boil, Then Turn the Heat Down So That the Chick Pea Stew Simmers. 4.
  By Now, the Couscous Will Have Absorbed the Water.  Put It Into a
  Metal Sieve, Metal Colander or Steamer Saucepan, Breaking It Up a Bit
  With Your Fingers Again as You Do So. If Your Container Has Large
  Holes, You May Prefer To Line It With a Piece Of Cheesecloth To
  Prevent the Grains from Falling Through, But I Never Found this
  Necessary. 5. Put the Steamer, Colander or Sieve Over the Vegetable
  Stew, Cover With a Lid or Plate and Cook Gently for 25-30 Minutes. 6.
  Season To Taste With Pepper.  Stir the Remaining Olive Oil Into the
  Couscous, Then Put the Couscous on a Large, Warmed Serving Dish,
  Garnish With the Coriander and Serve Immediately.Serve With a Green
  Salad.

  tomato mixture to beans and continue cooking uncovered, over a low
  flame for 1 hour or until beans are very tender. Makes about 3
  quarts. They used to say a cowhand would work from sunrise to sunset
  "for a dollar a day and a plate of beans." Now, either he liked his
  work or the beans were pretty good. And they tasted even better when
  the cook built a bean chili by adding bacon, tomatoes and hot
  peppers. From "Famous Chili Recipes From Marlboro Country".

      Title: CRAB ALFREDO SAUCE
 Categories: Sauce, Alfredo, Red lobster, Kathy
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter or margarine
      4 tb Flour
      2 c  Half-and-half (heavy cream
           If you REALLY feel wicked)
           About 1/2 cup (or more to
           Taste) grated Parmesan
           Cheese
           Salt and white pepper to
           Taste
           Few grains cayenne pepper
           (optional)
      6    8 oz. cooked snow crab meat,
           Cut into chunks
 
  Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Stir in the flour, and cook briefly
  until the mixture looks sandy.  Do NOT let it color. Wisk in the
  half- and-half, and stir until the mixture forms a thick sauce. Stir
  in the cheese, and season to taste.  Simmer for a few minutes to
  blend the flavors, and stir in the crab meat.  Cook JUST until the
  crab is heated through. Serve over cooked linguini, with additional
  Parmesan cheese and hot red pepper flakes on the side.
  
  Before some purist jumps me, I KNOW this isn't a classic Alfredo, but
  it is a very good dish, and remarkably easy to make.
  
  This may be varied by substituting cooked lobster meat for the crab,
  or by adding 36 cooked, peeled and deveined medium shrimp, and about
  a quarter of a cup of chopped cooked broccoli instead of the crab
  meat.

      Title: CRAB CASSEROLE IN A CLAY POT
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Fresh whole crab,
           -preferably live
      2 tb Peanut oil
      5    Unpeeled garlic cloves,
           -crushed
      2    Unpeeled fresh ginger
           -slices, 1/4 inch thick
      3    Whole scallions, cut into
           -2-inch pieces
      3 tb Fermented black beans
      2    Fresh red chili peppers,
           -seeded and shredded
      3 tb Rice wine
      2 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 c  Rich Chicken Stock
 
  Well here it is, in all its glory.  I've included Hom's method for
  making stock both because it's good and to give more of a feel for
  the book. Honk Kong is an extremely, almost excessively dynamic city
  and this is reflected in the food.  The book is interesting because
  he has a finger on the development of the "new" Hong Kong cuisine and
  notes traditional recipes from which the ones in the book spring.
  
  BTW, Michael++my roommate++and I were talking about this dish last
  night as we were munching up a plain old steamed Dungeness crab. He
  said he *really* liked this recipe. I found it too heavy on the black
  beans and spices. Here it is.  You be da judge...  ;-}
  
  Here is an interesting, innovative technique employed by Hong Kong
  chefs. The clay pot traditionally is used for the long simmering and
  braising of foods; nowadays, however it is as often used to infused
  intense flavors over high heat in a short length of time, as in this
  recipe. the classic Cantonese dish is given a new twist; the fresh
  crab is stir-fired with aromatic seasonings and then quickly finished
  over high heat in the covered clay pot.  The pungent black beans
  permeate the rich crab meat, enhancing it and adding to its subtle
  flavors. This delicious casserole is quite easy to prepare and turns
  an ordinary dinner into a special occasion.
  
  If you are using a live crab, prepare it according to the technique
  on page 77.  [Rinse, scrub and steam for ten minutes. S.C.] Cut the
  body into quarters and lightly crack the claws and legs.
  
  Heat a wok or large skillet until it is hot and add the oil. Add the
  garlic, ginger, and scallions and stir-fry to flavor the oil. Then
  add the black beans, chilies, and crab. Stir-fry for2 minutes and add
  the chicken stock.  Turn the contents of the wok into a clay pot or
  casserole, cover, and cook over high heat for 5 more minutes or until
  the crab shell turns bright red.  Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

   In this recipe Quebec snow crab is combined with brocolli,
  oven-poached and served on a sauce, nouveau cuisine fashion. This
  appetizer is the creation of Chef Denis Pelletier of Moulin de St.
  Laurent, a contemporary French restaurant located in an old stone
  mill in the village of St. Laurent on Ile d'Orleans. Ramekins can be
  filled ahead and oven poached at the last minute, or you can reheat
  the cooked flan in a microwave oven for about 2 minutes at Medium (50
  percent).
  
    Cook brocolli florets in boiling salted water just until
  tender-crisp; drain. Generously brush 6 to 8 ramekin or custard cups
  with melted butter.
    Divide crab meat with brocolli among the ramekins. In a bowl, whisk
  together the eggs, cream and milk; season with salt, pepper and
  nutmeg. Fill ramekins three-quarters full with the custard and set in
  a shallow pan of hot water. Oven poach for 1 hour at 325F or until
  set. (A knife inserted in centre should come out clean.)
    Make Lemon Butter Sauce and pour onto 6 to 8 serving plates. Run a
  knife around the edge of each ramekin and unmold onto sauce.
  
  Lemon Butter Sauce:
    In small saucepan, heat wine and chopped shallot. Bring to a boil
  and reduce over medium-high heat until only 2 tablespoons of liquid
  remain. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, a few pieces at a
  time, until sauce is smooth and all the butter is incorporated. Whisk
  in cream and lemon juice. Keep warm in the top of a double boiler set
  over hot water until serving time. MAKES: about 1 1/2 CUPS SAUCE
  
  SERVES: 6-8 as an appetizer

      Title: CRAB RICE
 Categories: China, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2    Green onions, chopped
      1    Piece fresh ginger, 2-3 cm,
           -grated
      4 tb Dry sherry
      3 tb Light soy sauce
      3    Blue crabs
    400 g  Glutinous rice
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Oil
      1 ts Sugar
 
  The Chinese have comfort food, too, and this dish qualifies. You will
  need a large steamer; if you don't yet have one, they can be bought
  cheaply in large Chinese or Vietnamese food stores where you can also
  pick up the glutinous rice. The dish takes considerably longer to
  cook than the previous recipes but little more of the cook's time. By
  the time the rice is cooked, it is saturated with crab flavour.
  
  Finely chop 2 green (spring) onions and grate 2-3 cms of fresh ginger.
  Combine them with 4 tablespoons dry sherry and 3 tablespoons light soy
  sauce. Prepare three green blue swimmers crabs. Chop two of them into
  several pieces with a large knife or cleaver and crack the hardest
  pieces of the shell with a hammer. Crack the third crab thoroughly
  all over but do not chop up. Pour the sherry-soy sauce mixture over
  the crabs and leave to marinate for an hour. Wash 400 grams glutinous
  rice in several changes of water until the water runs clear.
  
  Put the rice into a saucepan and pour over it 1.5 L water. Bring to
  the boil and boil for 5 minutes. Drain.
  
  In the bottom of a heatproof dish at least 12 cm deep and of a size
  to fit into your steamer, pack in the chopped crab pieces, reserving
  the marinade. Pour the rice over the top and pack it down. Press the
  intact crab into the top of the rice. To the marinade, add a further
  tablespoon soy sauce and a tablespoon oil, teaspoon salt and 1
  teaspoon sugar. Pour over the crabs and rice.
  
  Put the dish in the steamer over boiling water and steam for 35-40
  minutes. Serve. Diners deal first with the top crab, now half buried
  in rice, then fish around, for the rest of the crab pieces in rice.

      Title: CRAB-A-LEEKIE CREPES
 Categories: Fish*shell
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------LEMON CREPES-----------------------------
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Sugar [optional]
      2    Egg yolks
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Lemon juice, fresh
  1 1/2 ts Vegetable oil
    3/4 c  Milk
      2 ts Lemon rind, grated
      1 c  All-purpose flour

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Crab or Imitation crab
      1 c  Dry curd cottage cheese
      1 sm Leek, thinly sliced
    1/2 sm Tomato, finely diced
      1 sm Lime - juice only
      1 tb Balsamic vinegar
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Seafood seasoning

MMMMM----------------------WHITE WINE SAUCE---------------------------
      3 tb Butter
      3 tb Flour
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Sour cream, or heavy cream
    1/2 c  White wine
           Salt & White pepper
 
  Ingredient note: Imitation crab, has several commercial names but
  generally consists of processed pollack with natural and imitation
  flavouring. It is processed so as to resemble crab meat - a white
  mean with a red exterior. This product is less expensive than natural
  crab and makes an excellent substitute.
  
  Lemon Crepes: Combine eggs, egg yolks, and lemon juice. Beat the
  mixture to thoroughly combine ingredients and incorporate air into
  the mixture. Add the milk and whisk again.
  
  Sift flour, salt, sugar [if using]together in a separate bowl then
  gradually incorporate into egg mixture. Add vegetable oil and blend
  thoroughly. Batter should be very smooth and creamy. Do not allow
  lumps to form [don't strained out lumps - they should be passed
  through a sieve so as to break them down.)
  
  Add grated lemon rind and allow the mixture to rest for one hour. If
  mixture thickens during this period, 1-2 Tb of milk may be added. It
  is important that the crepes do not become pancakes.
  
  Use a large hot crepe pan [or lg round frying pan]. Add vegetable oil
  to pan and swirl to coat. Gently pour in only sufficient batter to
  coat the whole surface of the pan swirling to get a thin and even
  coating. The crepe should be turned when the top is set and the
  bottom is lightly browned. Only cook the other side until the desired
  colour is achieved. Remove and set aside to cool.
  
  Filling: Chop the crab, or imitation crab, into bite size chunks and
  place in large mixing bowl. Thinly slice the white of 1 small leek.
  Slicing should produce thin rounds. Press out the rounds so as to
  separate the slice into small rings. Add to mixing bowl along with a
  finely dice half of a small tomato.
  
  To the mixture, add approx. 1 c of dry-curd cottage cheese, the
  balsamic vinegar and the juice of one small lime. Add seasonings.
  [The seafood seasoning is a commercial preparation available at most
  stores.] Combine all ingredients in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap
  and allow to stand in fridge for up to 2 hrs.
  
  Remove from fridge and toss lightly. Scoop out sufficient filling to
  fill the centre of each crepe. Do not overfill. Roll the crepes up
  into packages and place in a microwave dish, seam side down. Allow to
  stand while making sauce.
  
  Sauce: In top of double-boiler, over medium-high heat, melt butter
  and add the flour. Cook, stirring constantly until thickened. Add
  liquids. Whisk while simmering gently; until mixture is the desired
  consistency. Reduce heat.
  
  Microwave the stuffed crepes. Time will vary according to quantity.
  For eight filled crepes allow approx. 6 minutes. Heat until very warm
  throughout. Adjust time if necessary according to microwave
  capability.
  
  Allow one crepe per person for entree, two crepes per person if
  serving with a garden salad, or three per person in serving alone
  with sauce. Pour a generous amount of the hot sauce over the top just
  before serving.
  
  Foot-note: the quantity of leek, the balsamic vinegar and the lime
  juice should not be eliminated from this recipe [at least not without
  trial]. The combination of textures between the crepe, the seafood
  and the barely cooked leek are a treat. The subtle flavour variations
  created by the short marination of the filling ingredients in the
  juice and the vinegar, are quite delightful and work well with this
  sauce.

      Title: CRAB-APPLE HOT PEPPER JELLY
 Categories: Fruits, Preserves
      Yield: 6 Jars
 
      2 lb Crab apples (1 kg)
  1 1/2 c  Water
           Red wine vinegar
  3 3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Sweet green peppers
    1/3 c  Hot peppers
 
  Crab apple pectin gives a good set to this hot pepper jelly. Mix and
  match hot peppers for colour and degree of heat. Banana peppers range
  from piquant to medium-hot. Cherry peppers and long, skinny green
  chili peppers are fiery. (Original recipe indicated 1 cup of hot
  peppers - recommend 1/3 cup if using fiery variety).
  
  When chopping hot peppers, wear gloves and don't touch your face or
  eyes.
  
  In Dutch oven, combine apples with water. Cover and bring slowly to
  simmer; cook until apples are very soft. Pour into colander lined
  with square of dampened muslin and placed over deep bowl. Weight down
  with saucer and heavy can. Let stand until dripping stops. Discard
  pulp.
  
  Pour collected juice into liquid measure; add enough vinegar to make 3
  cups. Combine in saucepan with sugar. Bring to boil, stirring. Add
  peppers; boil briskly for 8-10 minutes or until set (*). Stir for 7
  minutes to prevent floating peppers.
  
  Pour jelly into hot, sterilized 8-oz sterilized preserving jars. Seal
  with two-piece canning lids. Let cool and refrigerate. For long-term
  unrefrigerated storage, process in boiling-water bath for 5 minutes
  immediately after sealing jars.
  
  Makes six 8-oz jars.
  
  (*) to test for set: remove pan from heat, dip cold metal spoon into
  liquid and hold well above steam. Turn spoon sideways and let liquid
  run off; when it forms two drops that run together and drip from edge
  of spoon, jelling point is reached.

  Crepes:  Place eggs, milk and butter in blender; add flour and blend

  as long as 12 hours before making crepes. To cook crepes, pour 3
  tablespoons batter into greased, heated crepe pan or small skillet;

  both sides). To assemble crepes, blend half the Crab Filling with the
  Swiss Cheese Sauce; correct seasoning.  Place a large spoonful crab

  uncovered in preheated 400'F. oven 20 minutes, until hot and bubbly.
  This dish may be frozen or refrigerated before serving; if chilled,
  remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.
  
  Crab Filling:  Melt butter in skillet; stir in green onions and
  crabmeat. Mix lightly and cook a few minutes; add seasonings. Add
  vermouth and boil rapidly until liquid is almost evaporated.  Scrape
  from skillet into bowl; reserve.
  
  Swiss Cheese Sauce:  Blend cornstarch and milk; reserve. Put vermouth
  in same skillet that filling was cooked in; boil rapidly until
  vermouth is reduced to 2 tablespoons. Remove from heat; stir in
  cornstarch and milk mixture.  Return skillet to low heat and add
  cream slowly, along with salt and pepper; cook several minutes until
  slightly thickened. Stir in cheese and cook until melted and
  well-blended; correct seasoning.

      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      2 c  Warm milk
      1 c  Wheat bran cereal (All-Bran,
           -Fiber 1, or 100% Bran)
    1/2 c  Warm water
      2 tb Yeast
    1/3 c  Honey
      2 tb Olive oil or vegetable oil
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Cracked wheat
      3 c  Whole wheat flour
  2 1/2 c  To 3 1/2 c bread flour (or
           -all purpose flour)
 
  In a large bowl, add wheat bran cereal to milk and soak 15-30 minutes.
  Proof yeast in warm water.
  
  Add yeast mixture, honey, olive oil, salt, and cracked wheat to milk
  mixture and mix well. Add the whole wheat flour, one cup at a time,
  mixing well after each addition. Then add bread flour 1/2 c at a
  time, mixing well after each addition. When dough gets very stiff,
  turn out onto a well-floured surface and knead in enough remaining
  flour to make a good soft dough.
  
  Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let
  rise until doubled. Punch down, divide in half, and form each half
  into a loaf and place in a 8.5x4.5 inch or 9x5 inch bread pan and
  cover. Let rise until doubled in bulk.
  
  Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes, remove from pans
  and continue to bake for another 10-15 minutes until bread sounds
  hollow on bottom. May need to cover tops with aluminum foil during
  final 10-15 minutes of baking if top is browning too much. Let cool
  on racks before slicing.

      2 c  Bisquick
    2/3 c  Real buttermilk
 
  Work together Bisquick and buttermilk to smooth dough. Dip hand in
  just enough Bisquick to kneed dough in bowl until smooth and elastic.
  Shape dough into 16 thin patties, placing1 atop another forming 8
  biscuits in greased 9" round baking pan. Bake at 450~ 16 to 18
  minutes or until golden. Wipe tops at once in butter. They split
  easily because of the way you formed them with the 2 pieces. To make
  BONANZA Copycats, add 4 ts sugar. Shape into 6 patties, 1" thick, 3"
  round. Place close together in greased round baking pan. Wipetops in
  soft butter. Bake 450~ 18 minutes or until brown. Cool 10 minutes
  before serving. Split with thumbs instead of cutting with knife.
  These do not keep well. Right out of oven wipe tops again with dabs
  more butter to keep surface soft and tender. Source: Gloria Pitzer's

      1 ea HINTS AND TIPS
 
  Here are a few tips for baking your own crackers: 1. If you have
  cracker dough stored in the freezer, it's like money
    in the bank for spur-of-the-moment entertaining. 2. Baking sheets
  lined with parchment paper make easy work of
    cleanup. 3. Keep an eye on the oven because baking time may vary
  with each
    batch, depending on the heat and placement of the sheets. 4.
  Crackers store well in airtight containers, but last even better
    if frozen. 5. Homemade crackers usually are not as crispy as
  commercial
    varieties.  If they get a little limp hours or days after baking,
    revive them by heating in a 275 degree oven. 6. To reheat or crisp
  crackers, bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350
    degrees for 3-4 minutes.

      Title: CRACKLING RICE VEGETABLE SOUP
 Categories: Chinese, Rice, Soups, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Cooked rice
      1 c  Deep-frying oil
      1 c  Dried soybeans
      8    Nami black mushrooms
      1 md Onion, quartered
     10 c  Cold water
      2 ts Thin soy
      2 tb Sherry
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts MSG (opt)
      1    Clove garlic
     10    Fresh snowpeas
      1 lg Carrot
 
  Rice Cakes:  Work with cooked leftover rice that is slightly moist and
  sticky.  If too dry, reheat with sprinkling of water until sticky.
  Spread rice in frying pan or pie tin, 1/2" thick. Pack rice into firm
  cake: this is important to make sure rice holds together. Place in
  oven on low heat, and dry to slightly brittle texture; break into
  pieces. Ten minutes before combining with soup, deep-fry rice pieces
  until lightly brown. Strain, place in soup tureen, and keep hot in
  oven. Avoid holding fried pieces more than 10 minutes, as they tend
  to acquire a rancid taste and become overly dry.
  
  Vegetarian Soup:  Wash, then soak soybeans overnight in enough water
  to cover.  Wash and soak Nami mushrooms in 1 cup warm water for 1
  hour. When mushrooms are soft, separate caps from stems.  In large
  soup pot, combine water, beans, mushrooms (and stems), onion and
  garlic. Bring to boil, lower heat, and simmer 2 hours. Strain and
  reserve stock until ready to finish. Save mushroom caps and 1/2 of
  beans for soup.
  
  To finish soup, thinly slice mushroom caps, combine with strained
  stock, cooked soybeans, soy sauce, sherry, sesame oil, salt and
  sugar. Peel carrot and make thin flower slices (or use flower
  cutter); add to soup. Bring soup to just under the boil.  Add MSG and
  snowpeas. Cook for 2 minutes.
  
  To serve, seat your diners, place soup tureen of freshly fried, hot
  rice pieces on table and pour hot soup over them. If rice and soup
  are very hot, rice will sizzle and crackle to everyone's joy and
  amusement!

  seconds. Don't over-process though.
  
  Spread the mixture into the prepared tins, making sure the tops are
  even, and bake for about 25 minutes. Towards the end of the time,
  check to see if the cakes are done by pressing your fingertip gently
  on the middle of each cake. If the fingermark vanishes, it's cooked,
  otherwise leave for another 4 to 5 minutes.
  
  Let the sponges rest for a minute or two, then turn them out onto a
  wire rack and leave to cool. Whip the double cream, and when the
  cakes are quite cool, spread one half liberally with jam and the
  whipped cream and carefully put the othe half on top.

 Categories: Appetizers, Poultry, Hot
      Yield: 1 Appetizer
 
MMMMM-------------------GRAIG GARDINER KNHT09A------------------------
      1 c  Cajun hot sauce
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      1 tb Vinegar (more in proportion)
           Chicken wings; trim tips
           Flour
           Salt/pepper
 
  Combine hot sauce, with oil and vinegar.  Trim the wing tips and then
  poke each wint in 3-4 places with a a heavy kitchen fork. Marinate
  wings in sauce for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, covered. When ready
  to cook, drain in a colander, reserving liquid. Shake wings in a bag
  of flour seasoned with salt and pepper, and arrange on a lightly
  oiled heavy baking sheet. Bake 1 hour at 350 degrees, turning several
  times until done and crispy. Drain on paper towels.  They can be done
  on a rack but not under the broiler because the flour will burn.
  Don't try deep frying them because the moisture content is too high.
  They are good cold and also reheat well.
  
  You can bring the hot sauce to a full boil and save for reuse, but
  not more than once because it weakens in flavor. This is just a
  different approach but I thought you might find it interesting. Craig

MMMMM------------------------FOR THE CAKE-----------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Macadamia nuts
    1/4 c  Cake flour
      6    Egg yolks
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3 dr Vanilla
      1 ts Kirsch
      7    Egg whites
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
      2 c  Macadamia nuts
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3 tb -Water
      2 tb Corn syrup
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Whipping cream

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE ICING----------------------------
      2 c  Flaked unsweetened coconut
      1 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Sugar; to taste
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  For the CAKE: Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan. Toast the
  nuts in a preheated 325 F oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they
  smell nutty. Cool. Grate the nuts fine with a hand nut grater and
  stir in the flour, or grind them fine with the flour in a food
  processor. Beat the egg yolks with half the sugar, the vanilla, and
  the kirsch to a 3-second ribbon. Warm the egg whites over hot water
  or swirl them over a gas flame until barely warm, then beat them with
  the salt and the cream of tartar to soft peaks again. Spread the yolk
  mixture over the whites and sprinkle with a quarter of the nuts.
  Fold until partially mixed, sprinkle with another quarter of the
  nuts, and fold. Repeat until all the nuts have been folded in. Be
  careful not to overwork the batter and deflate the eggs. Pour into
  the prepared pan and bake in a preheated 325 F oven for 30 to 40
  minutes, or until the sides of the cake just begin to pull away from
  the sides of the pan. Cool. For the FILLING: Toast the nuts in a
  preheated 325 F oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they smell nutty.
  Cool and chop coarse. Shake the nuts in a coarse strainer to remove
  any dusty particles. Put the sugar in a small non-corroding saucepan,
  add the water, and cook over medium heat until light gold.  Remove
  from the heat and carefully add the corn syrup, butter, and cream.
  Stir over low heat until the caramel has dissolved, then stir the
  caramel into the nuts to bind them. Slice the cake into two layers
  and spread the warm filling between them. For the ICING: Toast the
  coconut in a preheated 325 F oven for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring often
  until pale golden brown.  Cool.  Whip the cream with the sugar and
  vanilla until it holds soft peaks and is just stiff enough to spread
  on the cake. Ice the cake with the cream and press the coconut all
  over the surface of the cake.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT FILLING----------------------------
      8 c  Apples thinly sliced
    1/2 c  Cranberries, fresh or frozen
           (or use cranberry sauce)
    1/3 c  Brown sugar - light
    1/4 c  Raisins - golden
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Apple juice concentrate
           (thawed)

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
    2/3 c  Quick-cooking oats
      3 tb Flour
    1/4 c  Brown sugar - light
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
      2 tb Apple juice concentrate
           (thawed)
 
  1. To make the topping, in a small bowl, combine the oats, flour,
  sugar and cinnamon and stir to mix well. Add the juice concentrate
  and stir until moist and crumbly. Set aside.
  
  2. In a large bowl, combine the filling ingredients and toss to mix
  well. Coat a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
  Place the filling mixture in the dish and sprinkle with the topping.
  
  3. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes. Cover the dish loosely with
  foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the filling is
  bubbly and the topping is golden brown. Serve warm.
  
  NOTES: I doubled the amount of topping at the request of my family
  (it is that good!) Also, you can put just about anything into this. I
  added jars of baby food fruits once when I didn't have cranberries
  and raisins and it was wonderful.

           Cranberry sauce
      1    Egg white, lightly beaten,

  for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to about
  1/8 inch thick.
  
  With a cookie cutter or a small glass, cut the dough into 2-inch
  circles. Prick all the way through each circle with a fork in 2 or 3
  places. Bake for 10 minutes. Brush the tops with egg white and
  continue baking another 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned
  and crisp. Cool the crackers on a wire rack. Yield: 50-60.
  
  VARIATIONS: For a crunchier cranberry cracker, add 1/4 cup Grape Nuts
  cereal or chopped, toasted walnuts with the flours. If necessary, add

      Title: CRANBERRY FRITTERS
 Categories: Desserts, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz Cranberry jelly, canned
      5 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Sugar
      5 tb Water
           Vegetable oil
           -- for deep-frying
           Flour; for dredging
 
  Cranberry tartness suggests the original Chinese ingredient, a firm,
  gelatinous jelly flavored with the hawthorn berry (or 'shan dza',
  which in northern China is pureed to make a delicious tart, thick,
  cooling drink). Enclosed within a light, deep-fried batter, the
  strips of jelly become hot and soft or, in the case of cranberry,
  almost liquid. Buy the "jellied cranberry sauce", not the whole-berry
  type.
  
  This recipe makes three to four small servings.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Cut the jelly crosswise into three round
  slices, 1/2 inch thick. Cut each slice into three strips,
  approximately 1/2 x 1/2 x 2-1/2 inches.
  
  Prepare a batter by blending the flour, baking powder, sugar, and
  water.
  
  Heat oil for deep-frying; after it is hot, keep the heat around
  medium-high.  Dredge the cranberry jelly strips lightly in flour,
  making sure all sides, including the ends, are dusted. Then dip them
  in the batter to coat completely, and immerse them in the oil until
  golden brown. Fry only a few at a time.  Drain on paper toweling, and
  eat while hot.

      Title: CRANBERRY FRITTERS FROM LOREN MARTIN
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits, Cyberealm, Ethnic
      Yield: 9 Dozen
 
      1 c  Fresh cranberries, washed &
           Drained well
      3 c  Flour
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Milk, plus 2 tb
      3 c  Shortening or oil for deep-
           Frying
 
  Place the cranberries on paper toweling and dry well. Sift together
  the dry ingredients and mix in the milk, a little at a time, to make
  a stiff dough. Flour your hands well, pinch off a small piece of
  dough (about 1 teaspoon), place a cranberry in the center, and roll
  into a ball with the cranberry inside.  The balls should be about the
  size of large marbles. Place the shortening or oil in a deep, heavy
  kettle, and heat till it registers 375F on a deep-fat-frying
  thermometer. Drop the fritters into the hot fat and fry, turning,
  until deep golden brown on all sides. Drain on paper toweling.  This
  really works best as a two-person operation, with one shaping the
  fritters and the other frying them.

  baking soda, and cloves. Add cranberries or cherries, blueberries or
  raisins, and hazelnuts or pecans.
  
  In a medium mixing bowl, beat eggs; stir in brown sugar, orange

      Title: CRANBERRY HONEY MUSTARD
 Categories: Mustard, Condiments
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
    3/4 c  Yellow mustard seeds
  1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
  1 1/4 c  Dried cranberries (available
           -in health-food and gourmet
           -stores
      3 tb Honey
      1 ts Salt
 
  As the dried cranberries soak with the mustard and vinegar, their
  bright red color leaches out into the vinegar. The resulting mustard
  is a pretty, cranberry-tinted pink.
  
  In a non-aluminum pot or jar, combine the mustard seeds, vinegar and
  cranberries; cover and soak for 48 hours, adding additional vinegar if
  necessary to maintain enough liquid to cover the seeds.
  
  Scrape the soaked seed-and-cranberry mixture into a food processor and
  process until the mixture turns from liquid and seeds to a creamy
  mixture flecked with seeds and bits of cranberry. Add honey and salt.
  The process takes at least 3-4 minutes, so be patient. You may need
  to add additional vinegar as necessary to create a nice creamy
  mustard; keep in mind that it will thicken slightly upon standing.
  
  After about one week of aging, the cranberry flavor seems to settle
  into this mustard and make it all the better, but it is perfectly good
  immediately. Makes about 3 1/3 cups.

           -chopped
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
     12 oz Fresh cranberries
           Confectioners' sugar
 
  Place flour in bowl of food processor.  With processor running, drop
  in chunks of the cream cheese and butter. Process until dough is
  formed.
  
  (Alternatively, mix the cream cheese and butter in a large mixing
  bowl by hand or with electric beater. Slowly blend in flour until
  dough is formed.)
  
  Wrap dough in wax paper or plastic wrap.  Chill for at least one hour.
  
  While the dough is freezing, make the cranberry mixture:
  
  Place the water and vinegar in a 3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil
  and let boil 5 minutes.
  
  Add the jalapeno peppers and the sugar.  Return to a boil and let
  boil 5 minutes.
  
  Mix in the cranberries.  Return to a boil and let boil
        5    minutes.
  
  Remove from the heat and pour onto jelly roll pan. Chill for at least
  one hour.
  
  When ready to assemble the cookies:
  
  Dust work surface with confectioners' sugar.  Working with a small
  chunk of dough, roll dough to about 1/4" thick. Cut dough into 2"
  squares. You can re-use the dough scraps.
  
  Place dough squares on cookie sheet sprayed with vegetable oil spray
  (do not *grease* the pan or you'll have a real mess!).
  
  Put about 1 t cranberry-jalapeno relish in the center of each dough
  square. Bring 2 corners of the dough-square up and seal well. (Cookie
  should be shaped something like this:

        | \  / |<--- Dough
        | /  \ |
         \   / <--- Cranberry exposed here
  :       \ /
  
  Bake 12 minutes at 350 degrees.  If cookies unfold during baking,
  press them back into shape while warm.
  
  Cool on rack.  Dust lightly with confectioners' sugar.

      1 tb Unfl.gelatin or 2 tb.freezer
 
  Wash and pick over cranberries, discarding any that are soft. Place
  in a deep saucepan and add fruit juices. Cover and simmer for about
  20 minutes, until fruit is soft. Mash to break up any berries left
  whole.
  
  Strain in food mill to remove seeds.  Return to saucepan and heat to
  boiling.  Add pectin, glycerine and gelatin, stirring well. Boil for 1
  minute. Remove from heat. Skim and pour into hot, sterile pint jars,
  leaving 1/2 inch at top.  Cap with hot sterile lids. Process in
  boiling water bath for 5 minutes after water returns to boiling. If
  any jars fail to seal, refrigerate and use within 10 days or freeze
  for later use. Makes 3 1/2 cups.
  
  VARIATION:  You can substitute 1/2 cup low-methoxy pectin solution
  and 2 1/2 tsp calcium solution for the liquid pectin and glycerine,
  but add calcium after removing from heat. If you plan to freeze the
  jelly, be sure to use the full amount of gelatin.

      1 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  (2 sticks) butter, softened
      4    Large eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 c  Fresh or frozen cranberries,
           -chopped
    1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
      1 c  Confectioners' sugar
           Candied Orange Peel and

           -follows; opt.)
           Fresh mint sprigs and gold
           -ribbon (opt.)
 
  1. Using a grater, finely grate the rind from 1 orange and set aside.
  If making Candied Orange Peel, with vegetable peeler, remove orange
  part of peel in strips from the remaining 2 oranges. Whether peeled
  or not, cut all oranges in half and ream in juicer or squeeze to get
  about 1 1/4 C juice. Set juice aside.
  
  2. Heat oven to 350'F. Grease and flour a 10-inch Turk's-head mold or
  tube pan. In small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda,
  and salt.
  
  3. In large bowl, with electric mixer on medium speed, beat granulated
  sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time,
  beating well after each addition. Beat in grated orange rind and
  vanilla until combined.
  
  4. Reduce mixer speed to low and alternately beat in flour mixture
  and 1 C orange juice (beginning and ending with flour mixture) until
  batter is smooth. Fold cranberries and walnuts into batter; spoon
  batter into prepared pan.
  
  5. Bake cake 55 to 60 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center
  of cake comes out clean. Cool cake in pan on wire rack 10 minutes.
  Remove from pan; cool completely on rack.
  
  6. Meanwhile, in small bowl, with electric mixer or spoon, beat
  confectioners sugar and 1 T  orange juice until well mixed (icing
  should be smooth and just thick enough to drip from a spoon). If
  necessary, add more juice, 1 t  at a time, to reach desired
  consistency. Prepare Candied Orange Peel and Cranberries, if desired.
  
  7. Transfer cake to serving plate. Spoon icing over top of cake,
  allowing it to slowly drip down the side. If desired, top with
  candied peel and 5 cranberries; decorate with mint sprigs tied with
  gold rib- bon and remaining 2 cranberries.
  
  Candied Orange Peel and Cranberries: Cut reserved orange-peel strips
  into 1/8-inch-wide strips. Drop strips into s@all saucepan of boiling
  water and blanch 1 minute. Drain strips in strainer. Repeat with
  fresh boiling water to blanch orange strips again. Drain and return
  strips, plus 7 fresh or frozen cranberries, to sauce-pan. With fork,
  stir in 1 T sugar and heat until sugar dissolves and coats peel and
  cranberries. Cool to room temperature.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
    1/2    - 3/4 cup sugar
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    3/4 c  Orange juice
      1 tb (or more!) grated orange
           -zest
           Equivalent of one egg (1/4 c
           -fat-free egg substitute)
      2 tb Nonfat yogurt, OR 2 Tbsp
           -applesauce
      6 oz Fresh cranberries (chopped),
           -OR 1 cup dried cranberries
    1/2 c  Nuts (optional!)
 
  Mix dry ingredients (1st group) in med-large bowl. Mix wet
  ingredients (2nd group) separately. Combine both groups, then add in
  fruit, and nuts if desired. Bake in LIGHTLY greased/Pammed muffin pan
  at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, or till firm to touch and light brown
  on top. Makes 12 muffins.
  
  This basic recipe is very flexible.  A few days ago I took out 1/4 cup
  flour and added 1/2 cup wheat bran - worked fine. I've also used lemon
  juice, lemon zest, and raisins instead of the cranberries. The nuts
  can be varied or just plain omitted (my husband likes the nuts - but
  to adhere to the rules of this list, you'd probably want to forgo
  them). Any kind of fruit can work - raisins, chopped dates, currants,
  dried cherries, dried apricots, etc.  The amount of sugar depends on
  the fruit used and your individual taste - cranberries are on the
  tart side. Experiment - this recipe seems to be fairly forgiving!
  
  I'll try to remember to bring in some other muffin recipes - like
  banana wheat-bran, and oat-bran raisin.

    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
      4    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Sugar
 
  From "The Family Circle Christmas Treasury."
  
  Combine the water, 3/4 cup sugar and the jelly in a medium-size
  saucepan. Place over medium heat until the jelly melts and the sugar
  dissolves. Bring to boiling. Add the cranberries and the pear. Cook,
  uncovered, over medium heat until the cranberries pop and the mixture
  thickens slightly, for 10-15 minutes. Cool completely.
  
  Preheat oven to 375'F. Cut the butter into the flour in a medium-size
  bowl with a pastry blender, until crumbly. Mix the 1/4 cup sugar,
  walnuts and cinnamon. Add the egg yolks. Mix lightly with a fork just
  until the pastry holds together and cleans the side of the bowl.
  Press the dough over the botton and up the sides of a 9" tart pan
  with a removeable bottom. Prick the bottom with a fork. Refrigerate
  for 30 minutes.
  
  Bake the shell in a preheated oven 12-15 minutes, or until golden
  brown. Cool completely. Spoon the cooled cranberry filling into the
  cooled pastry shell. Reset the oven to 400'F.
  
  Beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar in a medium-size bowl
  until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the 1/2 cup sugar until
  stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Spread half the meringue over top of
  the tart. Pipe the remaining meringue in a lattice pattern.
  
  Bake in the 400'F. oven for 3-6 minutes, or until the meringue is
  golden brown. Decorate with additional cranberries, if desired. Makes

  Here's a filling that should work nicely with cranberries. You may
  want to adjust sugar--the filling is tart, but you might like it
  sweeter. This recipe is enough for a 10-inch tart, about 1-inch deep.
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Whisk together eggs, sugar, zest and vanilla.
  Add the flour until well mixed. Set aside. In a small saucepan, heat
  the butter over high heat until foamy and brown. Pour the butter in a
  steady stream over the egg mixture, beating to incorporate. Add the
  cranberries and pour the mixture into your tart shell. Bake for 45 to

 Categories: Relishes
      Yield: 4 Cups
 
     12 oz Pkg fresh Cranberries
    1/2    Pineapple (Fresh) -OR-
      1 sm Can of canned Pineapple
      1    1" long piece of fresh
           -Ginger Root
      1 sm Hot Chili Pepper
      1 md Lemon
      2    Whole Cloves (opt)
      2    Allspice Berries -OR-
    1/8 ts Ground Allspice
      1    Stick Cinnamon -OR-
    1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon
    1/4 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Dark Brown Sugar
    1/2 c  Raspberry Vinegar
      1 pn Salt
 
  1.  Rinse and pick over  Cranberries, discarding stems or blemished
  berries.  Peel, core and finely chop the Pineapple. Peel and grate or
  mince the Ginger.  Seed and mince the Chili. Remove two strips of
  zest from the lemon with a vegetable peeler and extract the juice
  from the fruit. Tie the Lemon zest and spices (if using whole spices)
  in a piece of cheesecloth, or just add them to the pot.
  
  2.  Combine all ingredients in a saucepan.  Because of the
  Cranberry's high acidity, they should not be placed in an aluminum or
  cast iron pan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer the chutney
  for 8-10 minutes, or until the Cranberries begin to pop. Correct the
  seasonings, adding more sugar, vinegar and lemon juice as needed; the
  Chutney should be a little sweet a little sour and a little spicy.
  Refrigerate at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.  Remove the
  cheesecloth bundle. Submitted By RHOMMEL <RHOMMEL@IX.NETCOM.COM>  On

 Categories: Sauces, Fruits
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      3 c  Fresh cranberries (1 12-oz.
      3 c  Water
      1 tb Low-calorie raspberry gelati
      1 x  Artificial sweetener = 1 cup
      1 x  (aspartame or liquid sweeten
      1 x  Blue food coloring (optional
 
     In a saucepan, heat the cranberries and water to the simmering
  point. Simmer for 15 minutes, until the berries have burst and the
  liquid takes on a syrup-like consistency. Strain mixture through a
  sieve; discard berry skins.
    To hot liquid, add gelatin, sweetener, and 1 or 2 drops blue food
  coloring, stirring until dissolved. Pour into a 3-cup gelatin mold and
  chill overnight.
    Makes 12 (1/4-cup) servings.  Each serving is 1/4 fruit,
  approximately 11 calories.
    NOTE:  The reason for the blue food coloring is that without it,
  this cranberry sauce is very RED.  If you want it to look more like
  the canned stuff (a purplish hue), just add a drop or two of the
  blue).

      2 ea Med. apples, pared and chopp
      1 c  Orange juice
      1 ds Ground cloves
 
  Combine all, bring to a boil, stirring.  Cook over medium heat
  stirring constantly, about 8 mins - berries will `pop' and sauce will
  thicken. Chill. If you want it sweeter, you might want to try apple
  juice instead of orange juice.  We also like it with a handfil of
  chopped nuts - pecans preferrably, with walnuts a second choice. I
  have also thrown coconut (unsweetened) in it - although others liked
  it, we weren't that crazy about it. We eat cranberry sauce year
  around. I buy 15 - 20 bags during the holidays and pop them in the
  freezer for later use. Cook 'em frozen. They are great in
  bread/muffins, too.

      2    Package Raspberry Jello
           -(3 oz size)
  2 3/4 c  Water (1 1/2 cup boiling)
 
   Use the boiling water to disolve the packages of raspberry jello.
  Add cold water ( 1 1/4 cups) to help it set up. Let it set (in fridge
  is okay) until it's good and syrupy. Meanwhile, use blender to blend
  cranberry sauce and sour cream thoroughly. Blend jello in carefully
  (it makes for a FULL blender!). Pour into dishes, mold, whatever!
  Sets in about 7 hours or so, but is best made a day ahead.
  
   I also served this at a Christmas get-together in Dayton, and they
  asked for the recipe!! I'll let that be my recomendation for it!

      Title: CRANBERRY SWEET BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Nonfat milk
    1/2 c  + 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
      1    Envelope yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water, 105-115 degrees
    1/4 c  Nonfat egg substitute
           -equivalent to 1 egg
      1 ts Vanilla
    3/4 ts Salt
  2 1/2    To 3 cups flour
      1 c  Cranberries, coarse chopped
      2 ts Melted butter
 
  Heat milk and 1/2 cup sugar in saucepan to scalding, then cool to
  lukewarm. Combine yeast and warm water in mixing bowl, stirring until
  yeast is dissolved. Add cooled milk mixture to yeast mixture in
  mixing bowl. Stir in egg substitute, vanilla and salt.  Beat in 1 cup
  flour. Beat in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. 	Knead
  about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Put dough into greased
  bowl. Let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  	Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over chopped cranberries.  Let stand
  while bread rises. Drain excess liquid off cranberries.  Knead
  cranberries into dough. Shape into round. Spray baking sheet with
  non-stick cooking spray, or grease lightly. Place dough round on
  baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
  Brush top of bread with butter. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2
  tablespoon sugar. Bake at 375 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, until
  golden brown. Let cool to warm. Makes 8 servings.
  
  Notes:
  
  1. It is important to let the milk and sugar mixture cool completely
  before adding it to the yeast.  Or else you will kill the yeast and
  end up with flat bread.
  
  2. If after draining the liquid from the cranberries and kneading in
  the dough is moist and sticky, just add a little more flour.

      2 lb Cream cheese; at room
           -temperatue, cut into
           -8 pieces
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      4    Eggs; at room temperature
      1 pt Sour cream; at room temperat
 
   1. In a medium nonreactive saucepan, combine the cranberries and 3/4
  cup water. Bring to a boil over moderate heat and boil, stirring
  occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the mixture reduces to
  1-1/4 cups, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/3
  cup of the sugar until dissolved. Strain the mixture through a coarse
  sieve and let the puree cool completely.
    2. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Butter and flour a
  9-by-2-3/4-inch springform pan. In a large bowl, using an electric
  mixer, beat the cream cheese with the remaining 1 cup plus 2
  tablespoons sugar and the vanilla at low speed until smooth. Beat in
  the eggs one at a time, beating until just blended. Stir in the sour
  cream.
   3. Spoon half of the cream cheese mixture into the prepared pan.
  Drop 8 or 9 rounded teaspoons of the cranberry puree randomly over
  the top. Spoon half of the remaining cheesecake mixture evenly over
  the first layer and dot with half of the remaining puree. Repeat with
  the remaining cheesecake mixture and puree. (Avoid dropping puree in
  the center of more than 1 layer.) With a blunt knife, cut through the
  batter in a swirling motion to distribute the cranberry puree.
   4. Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake in the lower part of the
  oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in for 1
  hour longer. Transfer the cake to a rack and let cook to room
  temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight before serving.

      Title: CRANBERRY-APPLE STRUDLE
 Categories: Desserts, Fruit, Rcrockett
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      6    Granny Smith apples
      6 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Plus 1 tablespoon sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
        pn Allspice
        pn Nutmeg
    3/4 c  Sweetened dried cranberries
  1 1/2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in 2
           TB cold water
      5    Sheets (14-by-18-inch)
           Phyllo dough
 
  Peel, core and quarter the apples. Cut each quarter in half and then
  each wedge into three pieces (you will have apple chunks).
  
  In a heavy-bottomed 12-inch frying pan, melt 3 tablespoons of the
  butter over medium-high heat. Add the sugar and cook, stirring, until
  the butter and sugar melt together, turn light brown and have the
  consistency of peanut butter. Add the apples car efully (the sugar
  mixture is very hot). With a wooden spoon, mix the apples carefully
  with the caramel. The caramel will harden; don't worry, it will melt
  again. Mix together the cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg and sprinkle
  evenly over the apples. Cook the apple mixture, stirring often, until
  the caramel melts and the apples soften and start to look cooked.
  
  Stir in the cranberries and the cornstarch mixture. Cook for 2 to 3
  minutes, until the juices in the pan thicken and take on a glossy
  appearance. Transfer the apple-cranberry mixture to a shallow dish
  and let cool.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet that has a
  raised rim all around with parchment paper.
  
  Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Lay a sheet of phyllo on
  the prepared baking sheet. Brush the phyllo sheet lightly with the
  melted butter. Place the next sheet of phyllo on top and brush it
  with butter. Repeat with the remaining sheets, but do not butter the
  top sheet. Reserve a bit of melted butter to brush on top of the
  finished strudel. Place the apple-cranberry mixture in a strip along
  the long side of the phyllo, about 1 inch in from the edge. Using the
  parchment to help keep th ings together, roll up the phyllo to form a
  long log. Adjust the roll's position on the baking sheet so it is not
  touching the sides of the sheet. The roll will leak while it cooks,
  so make sure it is on the parchment paper. Brush the top of the roll
  with the reserved melted butter. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to
  30 minutes, until the roll is nicely browned. Let it sit at least 15
  minutes before serving.

      Title: CRANBERRY-JALAPENO SAUCE
 Categories: Condiments
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
     12 oz Cranberries, fresh or frozen
      1    Orange
      2 tb Tequila
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 md Jalapeno pepper
 
  Rinse the berries and discard any that are brown and soft. Finely
  grate the zest only of the orange peel, then cut the orange in half
  and squeeze out the juice. Add enough water to the orange juice to
  make one cup of liquid.
  
  Combine the berries, grated orange peel, juice and water, tequila, and
  sugar in a large non-reactive pot, and bring it to a slow boil,
  stirring occasionally as the sugar dissolves. Trim the jalapeno,
  discard the seeds, and chop it finely.
  
  When the berries begin to pop, add the chopped jalapeno and boil
  everything together for about 5 more minutes, stirring with a long
  wooden spoon. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little more water.
  
  Remove the sauce from the heat and allow it to cool, stirring now and
  again to prevent a skin from forming. Spoon it into a pretty dish,
  and chill if you like.
  
  This delicious, slightly spicy sauce is perfect alongside tamales,
  with cheese-stuffed crepes, or any similarly rich-flavored dish, or
  even with your Thanksgiving turkey.

      Title: CRANBERRY-ORANGE MUFFINS
 Categories: Muffins, Low-cal
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Natural bran
    3/4 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Sugar (Diabetic try 1/4 cup)
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
  1 1/3 c  Cranberry sauce
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
    1/3 c  Soured milk (1/2 tb lemon j)
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 ts Grated orange rind
 
  You may use commercial or home made cranberry sauce but not
  artifically sweetened sauce (muffins will not rise.) . Original
  recipe in The Lighthearted Cookbook by Anne Lindsay published in 1988
  in Canada used whole-wheat flour, and 1/2 cup buttermilk or low-fat
  plain yogurt rather than sour milk.
  
  1/12 original recipe - 156 calories, 1 starch, 1 fat, 1 fruit choice 5
  grams fat, 2 grams protein, 27 grams carbohydrate, 23 mg cholesterol,
  126 mg sodium   NOTE: listed ingredients & variations would be
  slightly different.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 F and spray at least 12 muffin cups lined with
  paper baking cups.  Low-fat muffins tend to stick even to non-stick
  pans.
  
  Measure 1/2 tbsp lemon juice in a measuring cup, fill to about 1/4
  cup mark with fluid milk and add some skim milk powder to make it a
  little thicker. Set aside.
  
  Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.
  
  Add remaining ingredients of your choice and stir until they are just
  combined.  Bake about 20 minutes or until lightly browned and firm to
  the touch. Adjust time if muffins are made smaller.
  
  VARIATIONS, substitute for cranberry: Banana-Date - use 1 cup mashed
  banana and 1/2 cup dates or raisins. If 2 bananas are not quite 1 cup,
  concentrated orange juice or orange/pineapple may be added. (Tested
  Jan 94 by Elizabeth Rodier, family member ate 2 warm ones.)
  
  Apple-Raisin - 1 cup applesauce plus 1/2 cup raisins, or coarsely
  chop an unpeeled apple in a food processor.
  
  Zucchini - 1 cup grated unpeeled zucchini plus 1/2 cup raisins.
  
  May be made as 16-18 small muffins or 9 inch square cake cut in the
  desired number of pieces.  For a diabetic meal plan, reduce the
  amount of sugar to 1/4 cup or 1 tsp. per serving (recommended
  guideline of American Diabetes Assoc.)
  
  This recipe is typical of healthy heart recipes with reduced sodium,
  cholesterol and fat but more sugar than a typical diabetic recipe.

  overwhelmed by the sweetness of the sugar.

 Categories: Dessert, Fruit
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        1 c  water -- plus
        2 TB cold water
        2 c  cranberries
      1/2    envelope unflavored gelatin
      1/4 c  honey
        1 c  fresh orange juice
  :          MUCH LATER:
        2 c  skim milk
        1    egg white -- at room
  :          temperature
  
  "This rich pink dessert is similar to sorbet but lighter in texture."
  (Untried)
  
  In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup of water to a boil, add the
  cranberries, and reduce the heat. Simmer the fruit until it is soft,
  about 10 minutes. Put the cranberries through a food mill to remove
  the skins, or press through a sieve; keep warm.
  
  Meanwhile, put the remaining 2 tablespoons of cold water in a large
  bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over it, and let the gelatin soften for 3
  to 5 minutes. Stir in the hot cranberries and the honey and mix well
  to melt the gelatin and distribute it evenly throughout the fruit.
  
  Let cool to room temperature and stir in the orange juice. Cover the
  bowl and refrigerate until well chilled. (From 4 to 8 hours)
  
  Beat in the milk, pour the mixture into a shallow metal dish, and
  freeze it until solid. Break it into chunks, transfer them to the
  bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, and process
  until smooth. Alternatively, puree the mixture with a hand-held mixer.
  
  Beat the egg white until it is stiff, fold it into the slush, and
  return the mixture to the freezing pan. Freeze the dessert for at
  least 30 minutes more. If it has frozen solid, transfer it to the
  refrigerator to soften for about 15 minutes. Serve in chilled
  goblets. Serves 4 at 170 cals each.

      6 c  Raspberries (3 pints)
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
      3 c  Cranberries (12 oz. bag)
    1/4 c  Fresh orange juice
           Grated zest of 1 orange
 
  Stir together the raspberries and 1 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl
  and let stand for 1 hour. Stir the cranberries and the remaining
  sugar together in a nonreactive shallow preserving pan and place over
  high heat. Stir constantly so the sugar does not burn until the
  cranberries begin to release juice, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking
  until all the cranberries have popped and the mixture is syrupy and
  comes to a boil. Skim off any foam that forms on top and continue to
  cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes more. Add
  the raspberries and all their juice and cook for 10 minutes more.
  Stir in the orange juice and zest. Remove a small amount of the jam
  to a saucer and place in the freezer for 5 minutes. If the mixture
  wrinkles when pused to one side, it is ready. If not, continue
  cooking for 5 minutes and retest. When the preserves are the right
  consistency, turn down the heat to a simmer and ladle into hot
  sterilized jars. Wipe the rims clean with a damp towel and seal with
  new lids and metal rings.  Process in a hot-water bath for 5 minutes.
  Remove, cook, check seals, label, and store. Makes 4 one pint jars.

      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 lb Tomatoes - canned, drained
           -(reserve liquid)
      1    Bay leaf - or 2
      1 ts Thyme
           Salt, pepper and Tabasco to
           -taste
           STOCK:
           Shells and claws for peeled
           -crawish, NOT the heads
      4 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Brandy - or Cognac
      1 c  White wine
           Water
      1    Carrot - cut into large
           -pieces
      1    Rib celery - cut into large
           -pieces
      3    Green onions - cut into
           -large pieces
      3    Sprig parsley - whole
      2    Clove garlic
      1    Bay leaf
      1 pn Thyme
 
  Number of Servings:   8
  
  Make stock first.  Ten pounds of boiled crawfish make one pound of
  meat. Peel crawfish, reserving shells and claws. Rinse shells and let
  drain. Melt butter in a large pot; add shells and fry until sizzling
  and hot, turning them often.  When shells are hot enough, heat a
  small pot, pour in brandy and ignite.  Remove shells from fire, pour
  in brandy, tossing and turning until the flame dies down.
  
  Add wine and water to cover shells.  Add onion, celery, green onions,
  parsley, garlic, thyme and bay leaf. Let it all simmer for an hour.
  Strain carefully and reserve.
  
  In another pot, melt butter, add flour and let cook on low fire until
  medium brown.  Add chopped vegetables and let cook on a low fire until
  wilted, stirring often. Chop tomatoes and add to pot with reserved
  liquid. Let cook a few minutes.
  
  Add stock -- just enough to make a soupy consistency ~- then add
  Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, thyme, crawfish, corn and about four
  of the cobs (for added flavor). Let simmer an hour. Taste for salt,
  pepper and Tabasco.  If using boiled crawfish, it is usually peppery
  enough.
  
  Remove the cobs and serve.
  
  If the soup is too thick, add more stock or water.  If it's too thin,
  cook a little more flour and add to thicken it.
  
  Serves 8.
  
  NOTE:  If you prefer to buy crawfish tails already picked, buy a
  couple of pounds of boiled crawfish and pick them so as to have the
  shells to make your stock. Shrimp may be substituted.

      Yield: 1 Servings

           -only (8 oz.)
      2 c  Onions; finely chopped
    1/4 c  Celery; finely chopped
    1/4 c  Bell pepper; finely chopped
      1 tb Garlic; minced
      2 tb Green onions; finely choppe
           -d
      2 ts Tomato paste
      2 tb Cornstarch; in water
    1/2 ts Paprika
      1 tb Salt
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts White pepper
    1/4 ts Black pepper
           Dash thyme
           Dash basil
           Dash worcestershire sauce
      1 tb Parsley; finely chopped
 
      You start off by boiling about 15 to 20 pounds of crawfish in
  lightly salted water.  Since you are going to use the water as a
  cooking stock, you want to make certain that the crawfish are washed
  thoroughly before you put them in the pot.  Use only enough water to
  barely cover the critters. Your boiling time should be about 4
  minutes (timed from the point when the water begins to boil rapidly).
  When they are cooked, immediately remove the crawfish from the water
  with a strainer ladle and set them aside to cool. Then, using several
  thicknesses of cheesecloth, strain out 6 cups of stock (you want to
  have extra stock just in case you need it) and set it aside. Peel the
  meat out of the crawfish tails, scoop the fat out of the heads, and
  devein the tails. Then divide the tails into two equal portions.
  Leave one portion whole, and grind up the other portion until the
  meat is finely ground.
       In your heavy 12-inch stainless steel or aluminum (_not_ black
  iron) skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and begin sauteeing
  the onions, celery, bell pepper, garlic and green onions, cooking
  until they wilt. This should take about 7 minutes, and you should
  stir constantly. When the vegetables are ready, stir in the tomato
  paste and cook it about 2 or 3 minutes.  Then pour in 4 cups of the
  crawfish stock, stirring it well into the vegetable mixture. Also
  stir in the crawfish fat. When it is mixed well, cover the pot and
  let the liquid simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes.  After the
  simmering process, remove the cover and gradually stir in the liquid
  cornstarch (dry starch dissolved in just enough water to make it
  fluid). Then cover the pot again and let the sauce simmer over low
  heat for another 5 minutes. Remember! You still have 2 cups of stock,
  and you can use it later to adjust the consistency of the sauce.
       Next, add the ground crawfish tails, stir them into the gravy,
  and mix in the paprika, salt, cayenne, white pepper, black pepper,
  thyme, basil and Worcestershire sauce.  Blend everything together
  really well, and taste the dish _for each ingredient_. If anything
  needs adjusting (more salt, more pepper, etc.), do it now. Then cover
  the pot, bring the mixture to a _near boil_, and immediately take the
  pot off the fire. Leaving it covered, let the etouffee cool down to
  room temperature so that the flavors will be distributed evenly.
  After making this dish over and over again, I've found that this one
  step is probably the secret trickery that makes my etouffee
  succulent. Add more stock if desired.
      Finally, after the mixture is cool -- and when you're ready to
  eat ~- reheat it to serving temperature, put in the whole crawfish
  tails, stir in the parsley, cover the skillet, and simmer for 3
  minutes. Then spoon the etouffee over steamed, buttered rice... and
  pretend your folks came from Nova Scotia! Hint: Because of the
  flavoring process, this etouffee will increase in richness the longer
  it sits. For some reason, it seems to taste better the next day. And
  it will freeze well. Also note that the sauce should have the
  consistency of heavy cream -- not thick, but not watery either!

  minutes. Stir in the crawfish fat and let the mixture simmer 4-5
  minutes more, stirring frequently. If the oil begins to separate out,
  just stir it back in until the mixture is smooth. Pour in the
  crawfish liquid and bring to a heavy simmer. Cook for 10 minutes,
  stirring often to keep the oil from separating. You can prepare ahead
  to this point, returning the mixture to a simmer when you are ready
  to proceed. Add the crawfish tails and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in
  the green onions and parsley and simmer for 1 minute more. Serve over
  cooked rice. Festival: New Orleans Wine & Food Experience; June

 Categories: Main dish, Fish, Cajun
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Butter
      6 c  Chopped onion
      2 c  Chopped green pepper
      5    Cloves of garlic
      4 ts Salt

    1/4 c  Tomato paste
      3 tb Cornstarch
  1 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  White wine
      4 lb Crayfish tail meat
      1    Scallion, chopped
      1 ts Kitchen bouquet
 
    In large heavy pot, melt butter and saute onions, celery, green
  pepper and garlic until soft. Stir in salt, black and cayenne pepper,
  sugar and tomato paste. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20
  minutes. Dissolve cornstarch in water; add wine to mixture. Cook for
  20 minutes or until sauce thickens. Add crayfish, green onion and
  Kitchen Bouquet. Refrigerate overnight. Reheat and serve over rice.
  Don't overcook. Boiling crayfish: Discard any dead crayfish in the
  sack. Wash crayfish in clean, cool water just before cooking. They do
  not need to be purged with salt during washing.   Place the live
  crayfish in boiling water and boil for 10 minutes. (Season the water
  with one pound of salt per five gallons of water. Add other seasoning
  to taste, including cayenne, garlic, onions, lemons, lemon juice and
  crab boil.) Don't begin timing cooking until watter returns to a buil
  after adding crayfish. It's usual to add potatoes and corn on the cob
  to the boil. Crayfish are easiest to peel when still warm.

           No ingredients
 
  It ain't no secret, good cookin' is made of one part fine ingredients
  and one part ingenuity.
  
  Not I can do without my pots and pans sometimes. I can do without a
  cookstove. And I don't always need the right recipe to throw together
  the right meal.
  
  But I can't do without my RO*TEL. It's won me more chili cookoffs than
  maybe a fella's got a right to win. And I use it in all my main dish
  recipes, from my Southwestern Shrimp Creole to my Shut Up and Eat It
  Tex Mex Meatloaf. (One taste and you'll shut up and eat it.)
  
  Plain and simple, RO*TEL will make a star out of any main dish you
  serve.

  In some parts of the country, particularly the Southwest, it's almost
  un-American to even think of brewing up a dip without adding RO*TEL
  Tomatoes and Green Chilies to give your taste buds a healthy shot of
  up and attum.
  
  Everybody does it.
  
  And they are all convinced that they have gone and invented an
  original, one-of-a-kind dip recipe that has never passed anybody's
  lips before. you might as well do it too.

           No ingredients
 
  I'm not quite like any cut and dried, country fried chili dipper who
  ever bellied up to campfire before. I'm outlandish, audacious, and
  can be as temperamental as a rattlesnake with corns.
  
  But I know how to cook.
  
  And I've got articles about me in Bon Appetit and other fancy food
  magazines and a wall or two of cooking awards to prove it.
  
  Sure it's taken plenty of experimenting and a few burnt pots and pans
  along the way.
  
  It's also taken an ingredient that's been around plenty of
  prize-winning kitchens in the Southwest for a long time: RO*TEL
  Tomatoes and Green Chilies.
  
  RO*TEL got its start from my part of Texas, down in the Lower Rio
  Grande Valley, where the land is fertile and the sun almost never
  forgets to shine.
  
  RO*TEL figured out a long time ago just how to take a handful of the
  finest tomatoes and green chilies and stir 'em together to add a
  double helping of flavor to any meal.
  
  Flavor that'll open your eyes.
  
  Jump-start your heart. (tm)

  Funny how trimmings make the food in the center of the plate taste
  better. And vice versa.
  
  Good trimmings have gotta have the same qualitites as a good cowboy
  boot. They gotta look good and they gotta be versatile enough to
  anywhere.
  
  RO*TEL gives trimmings a taste so zesty they could make a rabbit whip
  a bulldog in a fair fight.
  
  But don't take my word for it. Here's some recipes for side dishes and

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt (or less)
      1 ds Nutmeg
      1 tb Sugar
      9 oz Flour (1 cup plus 2 Tbsp.)
      5 tb Unsalted butter
      1    Egg (room temperature is
           -better)
    2/3 c  Water (room temperature or
           -warm)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 tb Lemon juice
      5    Apples, medium-large
    1/3 c  Sugar
      7 ts Flour (2 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp)
    3/4 ts Cinnamon
      1 ds Cloves
      1 pn Allspice
      1 tb Dark molasses
 
  Very lightly grease one 8- or 9-inch pie pan.
  
  To prepare dough: Melt the butter. While it is melting, combine the
  baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and sugar in a medium-sized bowl. Make
  sure to kill any baking powder lumps. Add the flour to the other dry
  ingredients, and mix very well to create a homogeneous mixture.
  
  Add the melted butter to the dry ingredients, and blend well. Add the
  egg (beat the egg separately first, if you like), and blend well.
  Gradually add the warm water, in three or four batches, incorporating
  each bit of water before adding more.
  
  Mix well. You should end up with a smooth light-yellow liquid -- much
  thinner than you would expect batter to be. Pour the batter into the
  pie pan, and refrigerate it while you go on ...
  
  To prepare filling
  
  Start preheating the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 Centigrade)
  Put the lemon juice into a medium-large bowl. Peel and core the
  apples. Cut each apple into 16 wedges (approximately) and then cut
  each wedge in half to make chunks. As you prepare the apples, place
  the chunks into the large bowl and toss them with the lemon juice, to
  reduce browning. After all the apples are cut, sprinkle the other
  ingredients *except the molasses* into the bowl, and mix well to
  blend and coat the apples.
  
  To assemble pie Remove the pie pan with batter from refrigerator. (The
  batter will have firmed considerably.) Spoon the apples into a mound
  on top of the batter. The apples should extend just about to the
  edges of the pie plate, but be heaped higher in the middle. If any
  liquid is left behind in the filling bowl, pour it on. Drizzle the
  tablespoon of molasses on top of the apples.
  
  Bake at 400 Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes, or until the crust,
  where it puffs up around the edges between the apple chunks, is
  golden tan, and an apple chunk, stabbed with a fork, feels
  appropriately soft (but still *al dente*).
  
  Try to let it cool somewhat before cutting and eating.
  
  Notes
  
  I like a mix of apples -- Granny Smith, Rome, Paula Red, Empire....
  (Although not Macintosh, as they cook into mush.) Depending on the
  apples, you may want to modify the amounts of lemon juice and sugar
  in the filling.
  
  Changes to the spices are good too -- like slivers of candied ginger
  in the filling.

      Title: CREAM CHEESE BUTTER COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    1/2 lb Butter
      1 c  Sugar
  2 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1    Egg yolk
      4 oz Cream cheese
           Raspberry jam
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and sugar.
  Add the flour and egg yolk and mix well. Add the cream cheese and mix
  well.
  
  Roll into balls about 5/8 inch diameter.  Place them on an ungreased
  cookie sheet (the cookies don't grow when baked, so they can be
  somewhat close together). Then press your thumb into each to flatten
  it and make an indentation to hold some jam.  Fill it with jam. Bake
  at 350 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  You can use any flavor jam you like.  The jam is the only part of the
  cookie that has any texture, so I prefer using it to jelly.
  
  Don't eat the cookies straight from the oven, or you'll probably burn
  your tongue.  The jam stays hotter much longer than the cookie.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple filled butter cookies with cream cheese. Yield: 3-4 dozen.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, but strenuous if made by hand.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 15-20 minutes baking.

      Title: CREAM CHEESE CHOCOLATE CHIP PIZZA (SOFT)
 Categories: Cookies, Desserts
      Yield: 2 12" pizzas
 
      1 c  Butter-margarine; softened
    3/4 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Brown sugar
      8 oz Cream cheese; softened
      1 ts Vanilla
      2    Eggs
  2 1/4 c  All purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
     12 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
      1 c  Chopped walnuts (Optional)
 
  Preheat oven to 375. Lightly grease two 12 inch pizza pans. Cream
  butter, sugars, cream cheese and vanilla in large bowl. Add eggs,
  beat until light.
  
  Combine flour, baking soda and salt in small bowl. Add to creamed
  mixture; blend well.  Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts (if used)
  
  Divide dough in half, spread each half evenly into prepared pans.
  
  IMPORTANT - DO NOT SPREAD ALL THE WAY TO EDGES, THIS DOUGH DOES SPREAD
  Leave about a half inch space between edge of dough and rim of pizza
  pan.
  
  Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool completely in
  pans on wire racks.
  
  To serve: cut into slim wedges.
  
  Personal note:  When these were brown and ready to take out of the
  oven they had a soft consistency - much like that of a soft batch
  cookie. I wanted a firmer cookie. Put them both back in the oven, and
  turned the off. Let sit for 1 hour hoping they then became more like
  a chocolate chip cookie.  They never crisped up, but remained soft.
  Still tasted good.

  Pulverised dried saffron strands
  
  Shortcrust pastry made with 225 g/8 oz flour, 65 g/2 1/2 oz butter,
  40 g/1 1/2 oz lard, and cold water to mix
  
  6 egg yolks 350 ml/12 fl oz/ 1 1/2 cups double cream 125 ml/4 fl oz/
  1/2 cup milk 65 g/2 1/2 oz white sugar
      1/4    teaspoon sea salt
  
  I first noticed this version of the old recipe in The Babees Book,
  and it seemed just right as a sweet dish for the youngsters being
  taught from that book.  There is a richer version made with almond
  milk for fast days outside Lent.
  
  Soak the saffron in 2 tablespoons water until the water is deep gold
  in colour.  Use the pastry to make a case 5 cm/2 inches deep in a
  20-cm/8-inch pie plate or cake tin with a loose bottom. Bake 'blind'
  in a pre-heated oven at 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6 for 15-20 minutes, then
  remove the filling of dried beans and return the case to the oven at
  about 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 for 6-8 minutes until dried out and firm.
  Remember a cake tin is deeper than a pie plate so the case in it may
  need longer baking than usual.
  
  Beat the egg yolks lightly in a bowl, then beat in the cream, milk,
  sugar, saffron water and salt.  Pour the custard into the pastry
  case. Bake it at 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 for about 45 minutes or until
  it is just set in the centre.  Serve warm.
  
  Make small tarts if you prefer.  The full recipe quantity of pastry
  will make 36 tarts, using a 7.5 cm/3 inch cutter. You will need two
  thirds of the filling for them.

      Title: CREAM OF CAULIFLOWER SOUP (VELOUTE DE CHOR-FL
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 sm Head cauliflower
           Salt
      1 lg Leek, white part only
           Fresh ground white pepper
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Creme Fraiche
      2 tb Flower
      1 c  Croutons
  3 1/2 c  Boiling water
 
  Blanch the cauliflower:  break the head into flowerets and put them
  in a saucepan with cold water to cover. Bring it to the boiling
  point, cook for one minute, drain, and rinse the flowerets under cold
  running water.
  
  Wash the leek, slice it into small rounds, and cook them in the butter
  until they are soft.  Stir in the flower, cook for a few minutes
  until it is golden, and add the boiling water. Add the blanched
  cauliflower, season to taste with salt and pepper, and simmer for
       20    minutes.
  
  Strain the soup through a food mill or puree it in a blender. Stir in
  the creame fraiche, correct the seasoning, and serve with croutons.
  
  CREME FRAICHE: American heavy cream is considerably thinner than
  French heavy cream.
  
  Use 1 teaspoon of buttermilk for each cup of heavy cream. Heat in a
  saucepan until it is lukewarm (about 85 F), pour into a glass
  container, and allow it to stand at room temperature until it
  thickens. In very hot weather it can thicken in as little as 6 hours;
  in cold weather it can take as long as 36 hours.  This can be stored
  in the refrigerator for a least a week.

      3    Egg yolks. beaten until
           -lemon yellow
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Drops Tabasco (optional)
 
  Place the chickeo, veal knuckle and butter in a large soup kettle.
  Lightly brown the outside of the chicken in the butter and the fat
  that wiil gather from the chicken and veal knuckle Then add the
  carrots, parsley, celery, pepper, onion and cold water. Continue to
  cook until it starts to boil. Remove all surplus fat and froth that
  may gather on the top. Turn the heat down and continue to simmer for
  2 to 3 hours, or until a fork can be twisted in the meat of the
  chicken breast.
  
  Remove the chichen and veal bones from the soup. Set them aside to
  cool. Strain the soup through a fine sieve and set it aside to cool.
  As soon as it is cooled, carefully remove all of the fat from the
  surface. Then return the soup to the stove and bring to a simmer
  again. Remove all the meat from the chicken bones. Discard all the
  skin and vegetable pieces, for you have already extracted all of the
  good in them.
  
  Beat the cream, flour and eggs together until all are smoothly
  blended. Add the salt to the simmering soup and mix well. Take about
  1/2 cup of the hot simmering soup and beat it into the egg and cream
  mixture. Then slowly add the egg cream mxture to tbe soup, stirring
  all the while. Continue to cook over low heat for a few minutes
  longer, until the soup has thickened and lightly coats tbe spoon. At
  this point add the Tabasco if you like this sharpness in creamed
  soups. Serve piping hot with saltines.

    1/2 c  Butter
    3/4 c  Flour
      4 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Dry white wine
 
  Cook wild rice according to pkg. directions for 30 minutes; drain off
  liquid and rinse. Set partially cooked rice aside.
  
  In a large Dutch oven or stockpot, combine the chicken and water and
  bring to boiling. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes
  or until chicken is tender. Remove chicken from broth and let stand
  until cool enough to handle. Skim fat from broth. Strain and reserve
  broth. Remove chicken meat from bones. Cut into bite-size pieces.
  
  In the same pot, cook mushrooms in hot oil for 4 to 5 minutes or until
  tender.
  
  Add onion and celery.  Cover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until
  tender, stirring once (I'd probably do the onion and celery first,
  until transluscent, and then add mushrooms and cover and cook).
  Remove from heat. Return broth to the stock pot.
  
  Add partially cooked wild rice to the chicken broth. Stir in the
  granules, white pepper and salt.  Bring to boiling and then reduce
  heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.
  
  In a large saucepan, melt the butter and stir in the flour until
  smooth. Add milk all at once. Cook and stir until bubbly. Stir into
  soup mixture. Stir in the chicken pieces and wine, and heat through.

 Categories: Caribbean, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      2    Generous cups eddoes (2 lb.)
           -- peeled washed and diced
    1/2 c  Onion; chopped
    1/4 c  Celery; chopped
      4 c  Rich chicken stock
           -- preferably homemade
      1    Bouquet garni
      1 c  Whipping cream
           Salt & white pepper
           Freshly grated nutmeg
           -- to taste

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Fresh cilantro leaves
           -- chopped
 
  Heat butter in a large, heavy saucepan and gently sweat the eddoes,

  stock, fasten bouquet garni to pot and bring to a boil.  Cook,
  partially covered, until eddoes are very soft, about 20 minutes.

      Title: CREAM OF EGGPLANT SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Eggplant
           Salt
      2 oz Butter
      1 md Onion, finely diced
      2    Stalks celery, diced
      1 ts Curry powder
      1 pn Thyme
      1 pn Basil
      4 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Potato, diced
    1/2 c  Cream
 
  Salt Pepper Diced tomato, for garnish Chopped chives, for garnish
  
  Dice the eggplant but do not peel.  Sprinkle a little salt over the
  eggplant and leave to stand for about 30 minutes. Put in a strainer
  and run a little water over the dice, pat dry. This removes any
  bitter taste which would spoil the soup.
  
  Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the onion, celery and eggplant.
  Saute', stirring occasionally until the vegetables have slightly
  softened. Eggplant absorbs butter very rapidly so you may have to add
  a little more or the vegetables will stick.
  
  Add the curry powder and fry to release the flavors. Add thyme, basil,
  chicken stock and the potato.  Cover and simmer until the vegetables
  are quite soft, about
       30    minutes.
  
  Put the soup through a sieve or moulin and add the cream. Taste for
  seasoning.  Add a little diced tomato or chopped chives for garnish
  and color.
  
  This soup keeps well for several days.  However, if you intend making
  it beforehand and keeping it, only add the cream when you reheat it.
  It thickens as it stands, but it can be thinned with a little milk.
