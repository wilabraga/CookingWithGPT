  could substitute water for the oil to reduce fat), until translucent
  and mostly soft.  Blend the soy milk, tofu, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and
  flour until smooth.  Then combine the onions, the soy milk mixture

  minutes. Cool plums on sheet.
  
  Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch-diameter round. Transfer
  pastry to center of another heavy large baking sheet. Overlap plums in
  concentric circles on pastry, forming 9-inch-diameter circle in
  center. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon in small
  bowl. Sprinkle sugar mixture over plums. Fold edge of pastry over
  plums, pinching to seal any cracks in pastry.  Brush crust twice with
  egg white.
  
  Bake tart until crust is golden, about 25 minutes. Run thin sharp
  knife carefully under tart edges to loosen from sheet. Cool 15 to 30

MMMMM-----------------------CABBAGE LEAVES----------------------------
      1 ea Head cabbage
           Water, to poach
      1 pn Salt

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 c  Bulgur
  1 3/4 c  Boiling water
    1/2 c  Pine nuts, toasted, ground
      1 tb Oil
      1 lg Onion, finely diced
      3 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      1 lg Carrot, finely diced
      1 ts Thyme
      1 tb Basil
      2 ts Sweet Hungarian paprika
      2 tb Soy sauce
           Black pepper, to taste

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      4 lg Tomatoes
      2 ea Garlic cloves
      1 ts Basil
      1 tb Parsley
      1 pn Oregano
    1/2 c  Water
 
  Bring water & salt to a boil in a pot large enough to hold the whole
  head of cabbage.  When it boils, place the whole cabbage in the pot &
  poach it until the outer leaves can be pulled away without tearing.
  Set aside 8 large leaves with no holes in them.
  
  Place bulgur in a bowl & pour boiling water over. Fluff with a fork &
  set aside until all the water has been absorbed. Fluff occasionally.
  When the water has been absorbed, mix in the ground pine nuts.
  
  Heat oil in a skillet.  Saute the onion, garlic & carrots over a low
  heat for about 5 minutes.  Be careful not to overcook the vegetables,
  but you do need them to be soft.  Stir in the herbs & the paprika &
  saute for a few minutes longer.  Mix in the soy sauce & cook for
  another minute. Remove from the heat & mix into the prepared
  bulgur-pine nut mixture. Stir well, grind in black pepper & check the
  seasoning.
  
  Place an eighth of the filling on each cabbage leaf & roll up,
  folding in the sides as you roll, ensuring that you have a tight
  roll. Transfer to a large baking dish, lightly oiled.
  
  Put all the sauce ingredients in a food processor & puree into a light
  sauce.  Pour over the cabbage rolls. Cover with foil & bake in a
  preheated oven at 350F for 40 minutes. Serve over rice.

      Title: AMARETTI
 Categories: Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 42 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Canned almond paste
      1 c  Sugar
      2 lg Egg whites
           Granulated sugar
           - for dusting
 
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 375F. Break the almond paste into small pieces and
  combine it with the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Mix on low
  speed until very fine. Add egg whites in 4 additions, mixing about 1
  minute between each. Beat the paste until very smooth, about 2-to-3
  minutes. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tube with the
  mixture. Line 2 cookie sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment
  paper. Pipe the mixture on the paper in 1-to-1 1/2-inch mounds, about
  1-inch apart. Fold a clean kitchen towel into a long strip and
  moisten the towel with water. Squeeze lightly to eliminate excess
  water, leaving the towel more than damp. Slap the surface of the
  Amaretti gently with the towel to moisten them and make the surface
  smooth. Sprinkle the Amaretti with granulated sugar. Bake about
  15-to-20 minutes, until they are well risen, a deep golden color, and
  their surface is covered with tiny cracks. Remove from the oven and
  place the pans on racks to cool. To remove the Amaretti from the
  papers, turn the papers over with the Amaretti still adhering to them
  and wet the papers with hot water, using a brush. Leave a few
  minutes, then pull on the papers to release the Amaretti. HERE ARE 2
  VARIATIONS OF AMARETTI: Amaretti di Pinoli: After moistening the
  piped Amaretti, strew them with pine nuts, sprinkling them on
  heavily, then pressing lightly with the fingertips so that the pine
  nuts adhere. Do not dust with sugar. Bake as for the Amaretti. Fior
  di Mandorla: This variation of Amaretti is popular in Southern Italy
  and Sicily, where the mixture is sometimes colored green or pink
  during the mixing. Their rough, craggy appearance is a nice contrast
  to the smoothness of the standard Amaretti. Prepare the Amaretti, up
  to, and including, moistening them with the towel. Dust heavily with
  confectioners' sugar and allow the piped mixture to dry at room
  temperature, uncovered, at least 12 hours, or overnight. After they
  have dried, indent each of the piped mounds with the thumb, first and
  middle fingers of one hand, positioning them equidistant around the
  circumference, and pinching gently inward, about half way into the
  center. Bake the Fior di Mandorla at 375F, about 15-to-20 minutes.
  Cool and loosen the Fior di Mandorla as for the Amaretti.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
    1 1/4 c  blanched and lightly toasted
  :          almonds
      3/4 c  powdered sugar
        2 ts all-purpose flour
        2 lg egg whites
      1/3 c  granulated sugar
        1 ts grated lemon zest
        1 ts almond extract
  
  In a food processor, grind the almonds to a powder by pulsing off and
  on to keep the powder loose. Mix the almonds with the powdered sugar
  and flour. In a separate a bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks.
  Gradually beat in the granulated sugar until stiff. Fold in the lemon
  zest and almond extract. Pipe the mixture with a pastry bag using a
  round 1/4-inch tip into 1 1/2-inch rounds onto baking sheets lined
  with lightly buttered waxed paper or parchment. Bake in a preheated
  275-degree oven for 1 hour, checking to make sure the amaretti don't
  brown. Turn off the oven and let the amaretti dry out for an
  additional hour--they should be very crisp. Store them in an airtight
  container in the refrigerator or freezer.

    1/2 c  Almonds, toasted sliced
 
  Make the crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat
  to 375-F. Lightly butter the bottom and side of a 9 x 3" round
  springform pan. Trim a 9" cardboard cake circle so that it fits
  snugly within the curved lip of the bottom of the springform pan.
  Cover the top of the cardboard lined springform bottom with a piece
  of aluminum foil, leaving a 2" overhang all the way around the edge.
  Carefully attach the side of the springform so as not to tear the
  foil. Wrap the foil overhang halfway up the side of the springform
  pan. Lightly butter the foil covered bottom and side of the
  springform pan. In the top of a double boiler over hot, not
  simmering, water, melt the chocolate chips with the butter, stirring
  frequently, until smooth. Remove the top part of the double boiler
  from the bottom and cool the chocolate mixture until tepid. In a
  large bowl, stir together the crumbs, nuts and sugar until combined.
  Add the chocolate mixture and using a fork, stir together the
  chocolate and crumbs, until combined. Press the mixture evenly into
  the bottom of the prepared pan, making sure that the crust extends 1"
  up the side of the pan. Set aside.
  
  Make the filling: In a large bowl, using a hand held electric mixer
  set at medium high speed, beat the cream cheese with the sugar for 2
  to 3 minutes, or until smooth. One at a time, beat in the eggs,
  beating well after each addition. Beat in the liqueur, cornstarch and
  vanilla until smooth. Stir in the chocolate chips. Pour the
  cheesecake filling into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with
  a rubber spatula. Bake the cheesecake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until
  a knife comes out clean when inserted near the center. Cool for 5
  minutes. Do not turn off the oven.
  
  Make the topping: In a large bowl, stir together the sour cream,
  sugar and liqueur until combined and spread it evenly over the
  surface of the cake. Bake for 5 minutes longer. Cool the cheesecake
  completely on a wire rack. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
  overnight. Remove the side of the pan and sprinkle the top with the
  almonds.

 Categories: Desserts, Christmas, Gainesville
      Yield: 4 Dozen
 
      2 c  Pecans, chopped finely
      2 c  Confectioner's sugar, sifted
      2 c  Chocolate wafer crumbs
    2/3 c  Amaretto
           Pecans, additional
 
  Process pecans and wafers separately; combine in food processor with
  sugar. SLOWLY pour in liqueur until mixture forms a ball. You might
  not need the whole amount, depending on the humidity level. (If
  mixture gets too wet, put it in the refrigerator -- uncovered --
  overnight to dry out some.)
  
  Shape into small balls; roll in additional finely chopped pecans.
  Store in tightly sealed container. Yield: Not nearly enough.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  One Christmas Eve I had to work, but I took a break to pop in a
  bookstore.  They were having an open house, and I managed to snarf a
  lot of these morsels during those stolen minutes! After Christmas I
  came back to hunt down the clerk who brought these -- my finest bit
  of sleuthing yet...
  
  *  These are equally enjoyed and requested by my friends. Although
  some have tried other liqueurs -- including bourbon -- the results
  are never as good as the original!
  
  *  I substitute Oreos for the wafers, plus use only 1 1/3 C confec
  sugar; don't worry about the cookies' filling because it is nothing
  more than confec sugar.

      3 c  Frozen unsweetened
           -raspberries, thawed
      2 ts Amaretto
           Sugar
 
  In 9-inch microwavable quiche dish, shallow round baking dish or deep
  pie plate, melt butter at high (100 per cent power) 1 to 1 1/2
  minutes. Stir in almonds and sugar until evenly coated with butter.
  Press into bottom and sides of dish. Microwave at high 2 to 3 minutes
  or until firm. If necessary, rotate dish during cooking.
  
  Beat cream cheese and sugar until light. Beat in eggs one at a time.
  Add sour cream, 2 tablespoons Amaretto or almond liqueur, vanilla and
  almond extract. Beat until smooth. Pour into baked crust.
  
  Microwave uncovered at medium (50 per cent power) 14 to 18 minutes or
  until cheesecake is almost set in centre. Rotate dish partway through
  cooking, if necessary. Cool on countertop to room temperature, then
  cover and refrigerate until serving time.
  
  Reserve some whole raspberries for garnish. Puree remaining
  raspberries. Push through sieve to remove seeds. Stir 2 tablespoons
  Amaretto or almond liqueur into puree. Add sugar to taste.
  
  To serve, spoon some sauce on to dessert plates. Place slice of
  cheesecake on sauce. Garnish with reserved berries.
  
  If you prefer, use 1 cup graham cracker crumbs with 1/2 cup finely
  chopped almonds for the crust. Use a food processor and pulse to chop
  nuts to an even consistency, rather than a fine powder. Also, you
  could substitute strawberries for the raspberries. To omit liqueur,
  increase almond extract in the filling to 1 teaspoon and use just a
  drop in the raspberry puree.

      1 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
           -(1 square)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      6 oz Chocolate, semisweet
      7 oz Amaretti
      4 oz Almond paste
    1/3 c  Amaretto liqueur
    1/4 c  Sugar, granulated
  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese
           -(room temperature)
      4 lg Eggs
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
 
  MAKE CRUST:  Butter the sides only (not the bottom) of a 9-inch
  spring-form pan (about 2 1/2 to 3 inches deep). Grind the Amaretti
  very fine in a food processor or blender.  Mix with sugar in a mixing
  bowl.
  
  Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler, stirring
  occasionally.  Add the melted mixture to the Amaretti crumbs and
  sugar and mix thoroughly. (Don't wash the double boiler; you'll be
  using it again in a minute.)
  
  Turn the mixture into the prepared pan.  With your fingers,
  distribute it evenly over the bottom and press it down into a very
  firm, compact layer. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Adjust rack 1/3 up from the bottom of the oven and
  preheat to 350 degrees F. Partially melt chocolate in the top of a
  double boiler, then uncover and stir until completely melted. Remove
  the top of the double boiler and set aside to cool.
  
  Break the Amaretti coarsely into a bowl and set aside. Cut the almond
  paste into small pieces, and beat on low speed with an electric
  mixer, while gradually adding the Amaretto liqueur. Beat until
  thoroughly mixed and set aside.
  
  Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the
  sugar and beat until smooth again. Add the almond paste-Amaretto
  mixture and beat until thoroughly mixed. Add the melted chocolate and
  beat well again. Add the eggs one at a time, beating at low speed
  until they are incorporated after each addition. Add the heavy cream
  and beat until smooth. Add the coarsely broken Amaretti and stir
  gently only to mix.
  
  Turn into the prepared pan, pouring the mixture over the bottom crust.
  Rotate the pan gently to level the batter. (Don't worry if the mixture
  comes almost to the top; it won't run over.)
  
  Bake 45 minutes.  It will seem soft and not done, but don't bake any
  more; it will become firm when chilled. The top of the cake is
  supposed to look bumpy because of the large chunks of Amaretti. Let
  cool completely at room temperature, then carefully remove the sides
  of the pan and refrigerate the cake (still on the bottom of the pan)
  for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is adapted from Maida Heatter's "Book of Great Chocolate
  Desserts," (Knopf 1980).  It won me a blue ribbon at the Martha's
  Vineyard Agricultural Exhibition and Fair in 1983. If you ever find
  yourself in front of a firing squad, this makes an unbeatable last
  request.
  
  *  Amaretti are Italian almond-flavored wafer cookies. They are
  usually sold in metal tins with the wafers wrapped in packages of two
  inside the tin. You can also buy Amarettini, which are the same
  flavor but much smaller and not individually wrapped. Since you're
  going to grind some of the wafers and break the others into chunks,
  it doesn't matter which size you start with. One brand is Amaretti di
  Saronna, Lazzaroni & Co.
  
  *  This is an expensive cake, both in terms of the cost of the
  ingredients ($15-$20) and the number of calories.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking, overnight cooling.
  : Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    3/4 c  Water
      2    Dried apricot halves
      1 tb Almond extract
    1/2 c  Pure grain alcohol and
    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Brandy
      3 dr Yellow food coloring
      6 dr Red food coloring
      2 dr Blue food coloring
    1/2 ts Glycerin
 
  Combine sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil,
  stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer until all sugar is
  dissolved. Remove from heat and cool.
  
  In an aging container, combine apricot halves, almond extract, grain
  alcohol with 1/2 cup water, and brandy. Stir in cooled sugar syrup
  mixture. Cap and let age for 2 days. Remove apricot halves. (Save
  apricot halves, as they may be used for cooking). Add food coloring
  and glycerin. Stir, recap and continue aging for 1 to 2 months.
  
  Re-bottle as desired. Liqueur is ready to serve but will continue to
  improve with additional aging.
  
  Variation: For a more prominent 'bitter almond' flavor, add 4 apricot
  nuts,** split in half, to basic mixture. Leave in for 2 days to 2
  weeks depending upon depth of flavor desired. Remove and discard
  apricot nuts. Continue as directed.
  
  **Note: Apricot 'nuts' come from within the apricot pit. You may
  split pits yourself or obtain them dried at a health food store.

      Title: AMARETTO-AMARETTI CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE
 Categories: Desserts, Cheesecake, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
 
  This is adapted from Maida Heatter's Book of Great Chocolate Desserts,
  (Knopf 1980). It won me a blue ribbon at the Martha's Vineyard
  Agricultural Exhibition and Fair in 1983. If you ever find yourself
  in front of a firing squad, this makes an unbeatable last request.
  
  INGREDIENTS (Serves 16)
  
  CRUST
        7 oz Amaretti (see note)
        2    Tbsp granulated sugar 1 oz unsweetened chocolate (1 square)
        5    Tbsp sweet butter
  
  FILLING
        6 oz semisweet chocolate
        7 oz Amaretti
        4 oz almond paste
      1/3    cup Amaretto liqueur 1 1/2 lb cream cheese at room
  temperature
      1/4    cup granulated sugar
        4    eggs (large or extra-large)
      1/2    cup heavy cream
  
  PROCEDURE (CRUST)
  
  Butter the sides only (not the bottom) of a 9-inch spring-form pan (2
  1/2-3 inches deep). Grind the Amaretti very fine in a food processor
  or blender. Mix with sugar in a mixing bowl.
  
  Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler, stirring
  occasionally. Add the melted mixture to the Amaretti crumbs and sugar
  and mix thoroughly. (Don't wash the double boiler; you'll be using it
  again in a minute.)
  
  Turn the mixture into the prepared pan. With your fingers, distribute
  it evenly over the bottom and press it down into a very firm, compact
  layer. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling.
  
  PROCEDURE (FILLING)
  
  Adjust rack 1/3 up from the bottom of the oven and preheat to 350
  deg. F. Partially melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler, then
  uncover and stir until completely melted. Remove the top of the
  double boiler and set aside to cool. Break the Amaretti coarsely into
  a bowl and set aside.
  
  Cut the almond paste into small pieces, and beat on low speed with an
  electric mixer, while gradually adding the Amaretto liqueur. Beat
  until thoroughly mixed, and set aside.
  
  Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the
  sugar and beat until smooth again. Add the almond paste-Amaretto
  mixture and beat until thoroughly mixed. Add the melted chocolate and
  beat well again. Add the eggs one at a time, beating at low speed
  until they are incorporated after each addition. Add the heavy cream
  and beat until smooth. Add the coarsely broken Amaretti and stir
  gently only to mix.
  
  Turn into the prepared pan, pouring the mixture over the bottom crust.
  Rotate the pan gently to level the batter. (Don't worry if the mixture
  comes almost to the top; it won't run over.)
  
  Bake 45 minutes. It will seem soft and not done, but don't bake any
  more; it will become firm when chilled. The top of the cake is
  supposed to look bumpy because of the large chunks of Amaretti.
  
  Let cool completely at room temperature, then carefully remove the
  sides of the pan and refrigerate the cake (still on the bottom of the
  pan) for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight.
  
  NOTES Amaretti are Italian almond-flavored wafer cookies. They are
  usually sold in metal tins with the wafers wrapped in packages of two
  inside the tin. You can also buy Amarettini, which are the same
  flavor but much smaller and not individually wrapped. Since you're
  going to grind some of the wafers and break the others into chunks,
  it doesn't matter which size you start with. One brand is Amaretti di
  Saronna, Lazzaroni & Co. This is an expensive cake, both in terms of
  the cost of the ingredients ($15-$20) and the number of calories.
  
  RATING Difficulty: moderate to hard. Time: 30 minutes preparation,
  45minutes baking, overnight cooling. Precision: measure ingredients
  carefully.

      1 c  Flour
      2 tb Butter; melted
    1/3 c  Sugar, powdered

MMMMM----------------CANDIED CITRUS SLICES; GARNI---------------------
      2    Oranges
      2    Clementines
      4    Kumquats
      2 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
 
  Prep: 30 minutes.  Bake: 20 minutes.  Total cost: $3.95. The cake
  bakes right on top of the filling, which is then rolled up inside.
  The cake can be baked up to 1 week ahead.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 F.  Lightly grease 15-1/2"x10-1/2" jelly roll
  pan. Line bottom and sides with waxed paper; grease paper.
  
  Filling: Beat cream cheese and sugar with electric mixer until
  smooth. Beat in eggs, milk, and vanilla JUST until blended. Spread
  evenly in lined pan.
  
  Cake: Beat eggs, sugar, orange peel, and vanilla in large bowl with
  electric mixer on high speed 8-12 minutes, until very thick, pale,
  and at least tripled in volume. (Eggs are the only leavening in this
  cake, so it is very important to beat them to maximum volume. Use a
  large, deep, narrow bowl rather than a wide one. An 8-cup glass
  measure is perfect.) Sprinkle with flour. Fold until just blended.
  Add butter and fold until just blended. Spread evenly over filling in
  pan. Bake 19-21 minutes, until cake springs back when touched in
  center.
  
  While cake bakes, spread clean kitchen towel (not paper or terry
  cloth) on countertop.  Sift powdered sugar through small strainer
  over towel, covering an area the size of the cake.
  
  Invert hot cake onto towel.  Remove pan and carefully peel off paper.
  Starting at one narrow end, neatly roll up cake, using towel as an
  aid. Cool completely on wire rack. Wrap and refrigerate up to 1 week.
  When ready to serve, garnish with candied citrus slices.
  
  Candied citrus slices: choose fruit with thin skin for best results.
  We used three varieties to vary size of slices. Use leftovers to
  garnish other desserts or as an accompaniment to ham or poultry.
  
  Scrub skins.  Slice in 18"-thick rounds.  Bring water and sugar to
  boil in wide skillet.  Add one citrus type at a time in a single
  layer. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered 20-40 minutes, until
  translucent. Remove to bowl with slotted spoon; repeat with remaining
  fruit. Pour syrup over slices; add a little water if syrup is too
  thick. Refrigerate up to 3 months.

      Title: AMAZU SHUGA (PICKLED PINK GINGER)
 Categories: Japanese, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/3 lb Fresh, Young, Ginger root*
    1/3 c  Rice Vinegar
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
           *Large pieces, pref. with
           -pinkish skin, scraped
 
  Whilst poring over my three volume loose leaf cookbook (inhabited
  mainly by stuff snatched from here) I ran across the following that I
  though you might be interested in. I think that the caveat about
  fresh, young ginger root is necessary to this recipe.  I don't think
  the older, woody stuff would work at all. Guess this originally
  appeared here from the heading...
  
  Using a sharp knife or a Beriner cutter,shave ginger root into paper-

      Title: AMBROSIA
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Cream, heavy
      2    Bananas (or equivalent
           -amount of soft fruit)
           Broken meringue
 
  Whip the cream.  Chop fruit coarsely, but don't crush. Break meringue
  into large crumbs.  Mix everything shortly before serving and pile
  into glasses.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple dessert for failed Pavlova attempts -- My mother used to
  make the banana variety of this when she cooked her meringues a
  little too long or too hot. I've no idea of its origins.
  
  *  I can never make up my mind whether I prefer the strawberry or the
  banana version. Peach should be pretty good too, though I've never
  tried it.
  
  *  This is a neat way of saving a Pavlova attempt when the meringue
  part fails:  it produces a delicious desert and no-one need ever
  know...
  
  : Difficulty:  very simple.
  : Time:  10 minutes presuming you have the meringue available.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

    1/2 c  Onion, chopped fine
      1 lg Garlic clove, chopped fine
    1/2    Inch fresh ginger, chopped
           -fine
      1 ts Dried hot red chili flakes
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Fish sauce (nam pya ye)
    1/4 ts Ground turmeric
      1 tb Corn or peanut oil
      1 lb Boneless beef chuck, cut
           -into 2-inch cubes
      1 c  Water
      1    Stalk lemongrass, cut into 4
           -pieces, lightly pounded
      1 ts Tamarind paste, dissolved in
      2 tb Water, and strained through
           - a metal seive
 
  This dish is known as a 'slow cook' and is prepared over wood fires
  in the villages.  Keeping the pan covered and simmering slowly
  ensures that the flavors are sealed in. It is a typical method of
  village cooking.
  
  Marinade: 1. Mix the marinade ingredients together; pour over been,
  and marinate for 15 minutes.
  
  2.  Put the beef and marinade in a pan, add the water and lemongrass,
  and stir to mix.  Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat
  for about 1 1/2 hours. Do not uncover the pan until beef is almost
  tender. Shake the pan once or twice during this time.
  
  3.  When the beef is tender, add the tamarind liquid; adjust the salt
  if necessary.  Cook the beef for 5 minutes more.
  
  Serve warm with rice and other dishes.

      1 qt Water
           Salt
  1 1/2 c  Blue cornmeal
           Oil, for frying
 
  Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, add salt to taste, and whisk in
  the cornmeal. Lower the heat and stir the cornmeal for 10 minutes or
  until it tastes done. The coarser the meal, the longer it will take.
  Pour the cooked cereal onto a cookie sheet or into a bread pan and
  set it aside to cool for an hour or so or until firm. Once it has
  cooled, slice it into pieces for frying. Fry the slices in butter or
  oil in a nonstick pan until lightly crisped on both sides. If this is
  to be eaten as a savory, sprinkle a little red chili or paprika on
  top just before serving.
  
  This is cooked like cornmeal mush, molded in a bread pan, and then
  sliced and fried. It is delicious with a clear corn flavor and odd
  purple-blue color. It's good with eggs and bacon, or with butter.

    3/4 ts Garlic powder
      4 ts Salt
    3/8 ts Red pepper -- crushed
      1 tb Oregano
      3 tb Parsley flakes
     18 oz Tomato paste -- 3 (6-oz)
           Cans
     24 oz Tomato sauce -- 3 (8-oz)
           Cans
  2 1/4 c  Hot water
      3 lg Eggs -- beaten
      3 lb Cream style cottage cheese
      1 lb Lasagna noodles -- cooked,
           (18 noodles)
     12 oz Processed cheddar cheese --
           Shredded
    3/4 c  Parmesan cheese
 
  Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
  Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
  servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
  served without freezing.
  
  Crumble beef; cook until lightly browned.  Stir in onion. Cook until
  onion is tender.  Drain off fat. Stir in seasonings, tomato paste,
  tomato sauce, and water. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  In another bowl, blend eggs with cottage cheese.
  
  In each pan, spread a layer of meat mixture (about 3/4 cup). Add a
  layer each of noodles (2 1/4), meat mixture (about 3/4 cup), cottage
  cheese mixture (about 3/4 cup), processed cheese (1/3 cup), and
  parmesan cheese (1 1/2 tablespoons).  Repeat layers until all
  ingredients are used. Pack food tightly to avoid air pockets.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Bake 30
  minutes or until sauce bubbles at edges.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
  wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
  together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
  food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
  tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
  food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
  for 10-12 hours before removing packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN LASAGNA:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Remove
  freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until
  sauce bubbles at edges and center is hot.
  
  VARIATION:  Italian Lasagna -- Use ricotta cheese in place of cottage
  cheese and mozarella cheese in place of processed cheddar cheese.

  and boiling for 1 minute. Let cool slightly.  Pour over Apples. Bake
  in 375 F oven for 1 hour. Serve warm. Note:  Apples may be frozen in
  pastry (before sugar sauce is added) if desired.  Good dessert to
  make ahead if you have lots of apples around. Just let thaw when

      2 lb Good quality bread
           -cut in 1/2 inch cubes
      2 lb Poached chicken thighs
    1/2 c  Minced fresh parsley

      5    Eggs
     12 oz Evaporated milk
  2 1/2 c  Homemade Chicken Broth
           -=OR=- canned broth
 
     Preheat oven to 350 F.  On 2 cookie sheets, toast the bread cubes
  for 15 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown. Transfer to a
  very large mixer bowl. Bone the chicken and very finely chop the
  meat, discarding the skin. (I do this in the food processor while
  chicken is still warm.) Add the chopped vegetables and chicken meat
  to the bread, along with the seasonings.  Toss. In a medium bowl,
  beat the eggs; add the evaporated milk and broth.  Pour over the
  bread mixture and blend. The mixture will be quite moist. Allow to
  stand 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 F. Transfer the dressing to an
  oiled 3 quart glass casserole that is 10 inches in diameter and 3
  inches deep (at this point, dressing can be frozen for future use;
  thaw before baking.) Bake dressing for 2 hours, or until the center
  of the dressing puffs up and is golden brown on top.

  Days 6,7,8,9:  Stir once each day.
  
  Day 10:  Add 1 cup each of sugar, flour and milk. Remove 3 cups of the
  mixture and give 1 cup each to three friends to make Amish Friendship
  Bread.
  
  BREAD:  Mix all the ingredients well with a wooden spoon. Pour into 2
  well-greased and sugared bread loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees for
  40-45 minutes. This freezes very well. Great to give as a gift. NOTE:

  nuts or chocolate chips may be added to the batter before pouring
  into the pans. Use 3/4 cup of whatever you desire to add.

      6    Celery ribs; trimmed
           -- cut in 1/4" thick slices
      2 md Onions (abt. 2 cups)
           -- peeled and diced
    1/4 c  ;Water
      3 lb Tomatoes; quartered
      5 tb Vinegar
      1 c  Dark brown sugar; packed
    1/2 tb Allspice berries
    1/2 tb Whole cloves
    1/2 tb Celery seeds
      1 ts Ground mace
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Place the celery, onions and water in a medium-size saucepan over
  medium high heat, cover, and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring
  occasionally, until the vegetables are nearly soft, about 25 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, cook tomatoes in a large heavy nonreactive saucepan over
  medium heat, partially covered, until they are very soft and almost a
  puree, about 25 minutes. Add the cooked celery and onions; continue
  cooking until the vegetables are completely softened, about 15
  minutes.
  
  Strain tomato mixture in small batches through a sieve into another
  nonreactive saucepan, pressing down firmly to extract all of the
  liquid. Stir in the vinegar, brown sugar and spices. Place the pan
  over medium high heat and bring to a boil.  Continue boiling,
  stirring often to be sure that the ketchup isn't sticking to the
  bottom of the pan, until the mixture thickens somewhat, 15 to 20
  minutes. Allow ketchup to cool, then ladle into jars.  Cover and
  refrigerate for up to 2 months. Or ladle the boiling-hot ketchup into
  hot sterilized canning jars. Seal according to the lid manufacturer's
  instructions.

  owns and runs a produce auction with her [Mennonite] husband, Paul,
  in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania."  [Mary describes the ketchup by
  saying]: 'The children love it on pancakes...It's sweeter than
  store-bought and not as tangy...'
  
  "The ketchup is good on morning hotcakes (an Amish custom) as it is on
  Cheddar cheese sandwiches, as a dip for fresh vegetables or freshly
  baked bread, and as a condiment with roast or fried meat or poultry.
  And it has one distinct advantage over the most popular store-bought
  brand: You won't have any trouble getting it out of the bottle,
  because it's not thick."

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S BAGUETTE - TVFN
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 3 14" loaves
 
  1 1/4 ts Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  (2 ounces) very warm water
           105 to 115 degrees F
      3 c  (13 1/2 ounces)
           Unbleached all purpose flour
      1 c  (4 1/2 ounces) cake flour
           (see note)
  2 1/4 ts Kosher salt
  1 1/4 c  Plus 1 tablespoon, (10
           1/2ounces) cool water - 75
           Degrees F
 
  Combine the yeast and the warm water in a small bowl and stir with a
  fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Combine the
  flours and salt in a large bowl. Pour the cool water and the yeast
  mixture over the flour, and mix with your fingers to form a shaggy
  mass. Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and and
  resilient, but not too smooth at this point. Let the dough rest on
  the work surface for 20 minutes, covered with plastic wrap or a light
  towel. (This rest period is the autolyse.)
  
  Knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes. Don't overknead it: The dough
  should be smooth, stretchy, and resilient. Place the dough in a
  lightly oiled bowl, turn it in the bowl to coat with oil, and cover
  it with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature ( 75 to 77 degrees
  F) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until nearly doubled in volume.
  
  Gently deflate the dough and fold it over itself in the bowl. Reshape
  it into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 1 1/4
  hours or until it has nearly doubled again. Gently deflate the dough
  again, reshape into a round, cover, and let rise for about 1 hour.
  Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface and divide it into
  3 equal pieces (about 10 ounces each). Gently stretch one piece into
  a rectangle, leaving some large bubbles in the dough. Fold the top
  third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business
  letter. Now form the loaf into a log by rolling the dough over from
  left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Fold
  the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of
  the loaf, then repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over
  the surface of the baguette while leaving some air bubbles in the
  dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough
  or deflate its airy structure. Set aside on the work surface to relax
  before elongating it, and repeat the shaping process with remaining
  pieces of dough.
  
  Now elongate each baguette, starting with the first one you shaped, by
  rolling it back and forth on the work surface. Begin with both hands
  over the center of the loaf and work them out to the ends until the
  loaf reaches the desired length. (Don't get carried away, or the
  baguettes won't fit in your oven!) Place the finished loaves on a
  peel or upside down baking sheet lined with parchment paper spring,
  resulting in loaves with a light, airy crumb and more flared cuts.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.
  Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat, and place an empty water
  pan directly under the stone. Use a very sharp razor blade or lame to
  make 3 to 5 slashes, depending on the length of your loaves, on the
  top of each baguette. The cuts should run from one end of the loaf to
  the other, rather than across it, and the blade should be held at a
  30 degree angle to the loaf so that the cuts pop open in the oven. Be
  careful not to press down too hard, or you may deflate the loaves.
  Using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves.
  
  Gently slide the loaves onto the preheated stone, or place the
  baguette mold in the oven. Pour 1 cup of very hot water into the
  water pan and quickly close the oven door. After 1 minute, mist the
  loaves and oven walls 6 to 8 times and close the door. After 2 more
  minutes, spray the loaves and the oven walls again.
  
  Bake for 12 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees F
  and bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer until the loaves are golden
  brown and crisp. Move them to a rack to cool.
  
  Enjoy your baguettes still slightly warm with some soft, ripe French
  cheese and a glass of wine.
  
  Yield: 3 - 14 inch loaves.
  
  Note: If cake flour is not available, you can use the same amount of
  unbleached all-purpose flour, but cake flour will give the baguette a
  lighter texture. BAKERS' DOZEN AMY SCHERBER SHOW #BD1A55 Copyright,

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S BIG BEAUTIFUL CINNAMON RAISIN
 Categories: Bread, Tvfn
      Yield: 1 Plump loaf
 
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
      3 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 c  (7.5 ounces) dark raisins
      2 tb Unbleached all purpose flour
      1    Big Beautiful White Pan
           Loaf Dough (1 batch
           See Recipe)
 
  Equipment: One 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, oiled or buttered
  
  Mix one batch of the White Pan Loaf dough according to instructions
  given in recipe.
  
  Place the just mixed dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour.
  Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room
  temperature (75 degrees to 77 degrees F) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until
  it doubles in volume. (An indentation made by poking your finger deep
  into the dough should not spring back.)
  
  While the dough is rising, place the raisins in a bowl or a plastic
  container and fill with warm water to come just below the top of the
  raisins. (If you use too much water, you will rinse away the natural
  sweetness of the raisins.)
  
  Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the
  dough and pat it into a rectangle that is about 3/4 of an inch thick,
  and about 6 inches by 12 inches in size. The short sides should be
  the top and bottom edges.
  
  Mix the cinnamon and sugar together, and sprinkle it evenly over the
  dough.
  
  Drain the raisins and toss them with the remaining 2 tablespoons
  flour. Spread the raisins evenly over the dough and gently press them
  into it.
  
  Starting at a short side, roll the dough into a log. Roll the dough
  tightly, keeping the skin of the dough slightly taut, and tucking in
  any raisins that fall out, but don't stretch the dough so tight that
  the skin tears. Seal the seam of the log gently but tightly using the
  heel of your hand against the surface of the table, or pinch it shut
  with your fingers.
  
  Place the loaf in an oiled or buttered 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, and
  cover with oiled plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature
  for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the loaf has risen almost 1 inch
  above the sides of the pans.
  
  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
  
  Place the loaf pan on the center oven rack. Using a plant sprayer,
  mist the loaf 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut the oven door. Spray
  the bread again after 2 minutes.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees
  F and bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is deep brown
  and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. The crust may
  color quickly because of the cinnamon and raisins in the dough; watch
  carefully and cover the top of the loaf loosely with foil if it is
  browning too fast. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove the
  bread from the pan and place the loaf on a rack to cool. Let cool
  completely before slicing, or the bread will fall apart. This bread
  keeps well for at least 2 days.

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S BIG BEAUTIFUL WHITE PAN LOAVES
 Categories: Bread, Tvfn
      Yield: 1 2 lb loaf
 
    1/4 c  (2 oz) very warm water
           (105 degrees
           To 115 degrees F)
  1 3/4 ts Active dry yeast
  4 1/2 c  (20 1/4 oz) unbleached
           All-purpose flour
  2 1/4 ts Kosher salt
  1 1/4 c  Plus 2 tablespoons (11 oz)
           Cool water (75 degrees)
 
  Equipment: 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, lightly oiled
  
  In a small measuring cup, mix the warm water and yeast with a fork to
  dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes.
  
  Mix the flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast
  mixture and the cool water. Using your fingers, mix the dough into a
  sticky mass.
  
  When all of the flour is incorporated, move the dough to a lightly
  floured work surface and knead for 4 minutes. The dough should be
  sticky and will not look smooth. If the dough feels stiff or dry,
  knead in additional cool water, a tablespoon at a time.
  
  Put the dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover, and let rest for 20
  minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.)
  
  Return the dough to the lightly floured surface and knead it for 7 to
  8 minutes. The dough will go from being sticky to smooth and will
  become supple but not too firm.
  
  Place the dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover the
  bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75
  to 77 degrees F) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An
  indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not
  spring back.)
  
  Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the
  dough and pat it into a rectangle. The short sides should be the top
  and bottom edges. Fold the top edge down and the bottom edge up,
  overlapping them slightly, then turn the dough a quarter turn and
  fold the top down and the bottom up again to form an envelope. Shape
  the dough into a log shape by rolling the loaf down two to three
  times and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Roll the loaf
  back and forth on the table to smooth out.
  
  Place the loaf seam side down in a lightly oiled 9 by 5 inch loaf pan.
  Gently press down on the loaf to spread it to fill the corners of the
  pan, and cover it with oiled plastic wrap.
  
  Let the loaf rise at 75 degrees to 77 degrees F for about 1 to 1 1/4
  hours, or until it has doubled and risen about 1-inch above the edge
  of the pan.
  
  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
  
  Gently place the loaf pan on the center rack of the oven. Using a
  plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaf with water 6 to 8 times, then
  shut the oven door. After 3 minutes, mist the loaf again.
  
  Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees
  F and bake for 30 minutes longer, or until the top is a deep golden
  brown. Remove the loaf from the pan it should come out with ease. The
  bread should sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom, and the
  sides of the loaf should be brown. Immediately place the loaf from
  the pan on a wire rack to cool. Serve slightly warm, with butter and
  lots of homemade jam!

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S CHOCOLATE ROLLS - TVFN
 Categories: Bread, Dessert, Chocolate
      Yield: 12 2.5oz roll
 
      2 ts Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  (2 ounces) very warm water
           (105 to 115 degrees F)
    1/3 c  Plus 1/4 teaspoon (2 ounces)
           Granulated sugar
      3 c  Plus 2 tablespoons
           (14 ounces) unbleached
           All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 1/2 ts Kosher salt
      1 c  (8 ounces) warm brewed
           Coffee (90 degrees F)
      1 lg Egg yolk
      2 ts Unsalted butter, softened
    2/3 c  (4 ounces) chocolate chips
    1/2 c  (4 ounces) cold water
  1 1/4 ts Cornstarch
 
  Two 12 by 17-inch baking sheets, lined with parchment paper
  
  Place the yeast and warm water in a large bowl. Stir with a fork to
  dissolve the yeast and allow it to stand for about 3 minutes.
  
  Whisk the unbleached flour, cocoa powder, the remaining 1/3 cup sugar
  and the salt together in a medium bowl. Set them aside.
  
  Using your hand, stir the coffee, the egg yolk, and the butter into
  the dissolved yeast. Gradually add the flour mixture, stirring until
  a shaggy mass forms and all of the flour is moistened.
  
  Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 7 to 8
  minutes, until it is silky smooth and elastic. This dough should be
  nice and moist, so add flour sparingly as you work. Shape the dough
  into a loose ball cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for
  about 10 minutes to relax the gluten strands.
  
  Flatten the dough and stretch it gently with your fingers to form a
  rectangle about an inch thick. Spread the peanut butter chips evenly
  over the rectangle. Fold the dough into an envelope and knead gently
  for 2 to 3 minutes, until the chips are well distributed. The dough
  should be soft, smooth, and springy. If the dough resists, let it
  rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading it. Some of the chips
  may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again
  after the first rise when the dough has softened.
  
  Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled
  bowl. Turn to coat the top of the dough with oil, and cover the bowl
  tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature (75 to 77
  degrees F) until the dough has doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
  
  Line two 12 by 17-inch baking sheets with parchment paper. Gently
  pour the dough onto the floured work surface pressing any loose
  chocolate chips into dough. Flour your hands lightly divide the dough
  into 12 equal pieces (each weighing about 2 1/2 ounces). Shape the
  pieces into rolls and place 6 on each prepared baking sheet leaving
  several inches between the rolls so they won't grow together as they
  rise. Cover them loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let them rise at
  room temperature until doubled in volume, about
       45    minutes to 1 hour.
  
  While the bread is proofing make a cornstarch wash: Put the cold
  water in a small saucepan and whisk in the cornstarch. Bring to a
  boil, stirring frequently until it thickens. Remove from the heat and
  cover to keep a skin from forming. Set aside to cool.
  
  About 15 minutes before you're ready to bake, place one oven rack in
  the top third of the oven, and another in the bottom third, and
  preheat the oven to
      400    degrees F.
  
  When the buns have doubled, use a pastry brush to paint them with a
  thin coating of the cornstarch wash. Brush gently so you don't
  deflate them. Place one pan on each oven rack. Using a plant sprayer,
  immediately mist the top and sides of the oven 6 to 8 times and
  quickly close the oven door. Repeat this misting procedure two more
  times at 1-mintue intervals.
  
  Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees
  F and rotate the pans from top to bottom and front to back to ensure
  even baking. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until the tops of
  the buns feel firm but not hard when you press them slightly, and the
  bottoms are very lightly browned. These rolls should have a thin soft
  covering, not a hard crunchy crust. Remove from the oven and use the
  pastry brush to paint the top of each bun quickly and evenly with the
  cornstarch wash. Transfer the rolls to a rack and allow them to cool
  before serving. These are best eaten the day they are baked. BAKER'S

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S CRUSTY ITALIAN LOAF - TVFN
 Categories: Bread
      Yield: 3 Loaves
 
    3/4 ts Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  (2 ounces) very warm
           Water(105 to 115 degrees F)
      1 c  (8 ounces)cool water ( 75
           Degrees F)
  1 1/2 c  (12 ounces) Sponge Starter
           (recipe follows)
  3 1/2 c  (16 ounces) unbleached
           All-purpose flour
      1 tb Plus 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
 
  A sponge starter bread
  
  Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a fork
  to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for
        3    minutes.
  
  Add the cool water and sponge to the yeast mixture and mix with your
  fingers for about 2 minutes, breaking up the sponge. The mixture
  should look milky and slightly foamy. Add the flour and salt and mix
  with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the
  bowl and folding the ingredients together until the dough gathers
  into a mass. It will be wet and sticky, with long strands of dough
  hanging from your fingers. If the dough is not sticky, add 1
  tablespoon of water.
  
  Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5
  minutes, until it becomes supple and fairly smooth. This is a sticky,
  wet dough; don't be tempted to add more flour to the work surface.
  Just dust lightly and use a dough scraper as necessary to loosen the
  dough from the table during kneading. Allow the dough to rest for 15
  minutes, covered with oiled plastic wrap. (This rest period is the
  autolyse.)
  
  Knead the dough 3 to 5 minutes, until it is stretchy and smooth, yet
  still slightly sticky. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in
  a lightly oiled bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with
  oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise
  at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) for about 1 hour, or until
  the dough looks slightly puffy but has not doubled.
  
  Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, or
  preferably, overnight to let it relax, develop flavor, and become
  more manageable.
  
  Take the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room
  temperature for 1 to 2 hours, until it begins to warm up and starts
  to rise.
  
  Flour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it. Divide
  the dough into three equal pieces, about 13 ounces each. Gently
  flatten one piece, pressing out some of the air bubbles, and stretch
  it into a rectangle. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up
  as if you were folding a business letter. Now form the loaf into a
  short baguette by rolling the dough over from left to right and
  sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Fold the dough over
  about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then
  repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of
  the loaf while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. Seal the seam,
  being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy
  structure. Do not elongate. These loaves are about 10 inches long.
  Cover an area on the work surface with a thick layer of flour and
  place the loaf, seam side down, on the flour. Repeat with remaining
  pieces of dough. The loaves will be loose and slightly irregular in
  shape. Leave plenty of space between the loaves they will spread as
  they rise. Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic and let them rise
  for 1 2 hours, until bubbly and loose.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.
  Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack
  just below the stone.
  
  Sprinkle a peel very generously with cornmeal. Line an upside-down
  baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle very generously with
  cornmeal. Lift one loaf, flip it over so the floured side is on top,
  and gently tug on the ends to stretch the loaf to the full length of
  the peel, or about 14 inches on a pan. Repeat with the remaining
  loaves, placing 2 on the peel and 1 on the pan. Dimple each loaf with
  your finger in about 6 places, but don't deflate them too much. Be
  sure the loaves are loosened from the peel, then carefully slide them
  onto the baking stone. Place the pan of bread on the rack below the
  stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaves with water 8 to
  10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist the loaves again after 1
  minute. Then mist again 1 minute later.
  
  Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees
  and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaves sound slightly hollow
  when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown.
  (If the crust is not brown enough, the loaves will soften as they
  cool.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes
  before serving. BAKERS' DOZEN AMY SCHERBER SHOW #BD1A52 Copyright,

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S ORGANIC WHOLE WHEAT SANDWICH B
 Categories: Bread
      Yield: 2 Lg loaves
 
           See part 1
 
  A sponge starter bread Mildly sweet and slightly crunchy, our version
  of whole wheat oatmeal bread is great for tuna sandwiches. Cut in
  thick slices, it's perfect for French toast. Shape it into rolls for
  a dinner party or a family picnic. For variety, add one and a half
  cups (seven and a half ounces) of golden raisins to the dough and
  shape half of it into twists; crusty and delicious, they're good for
  breakfast-on-the-go and afternoon snacks. This versatile bread is
  sure to become one of your favorites.
  
  SPONGE STARTER
  
  1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) very warm water (105 to 115 degrees)
      1/4    teaspoon active dry yeast 3 1/2 cups (16 ounces) unbleached
  all-purpose flour One 2-quart clear plastic container
  
  Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously
  with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes, until a smooth, somewhat
  elastic batter has formed. The batter will be very stiff; it gets
  softer and more elastic after it has proofed. You may find it easier
  to mix the sponge using electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough
  hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the sponge into a
  2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this
  point you have two options:
  
  If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge
  rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it
  just begins to collapse. This may take from 6 to 8 hours, depending
  on the temperature of the sponge, the temperature of the room, and
  the strength of theyeast. The sponge will triple in volume and small
  dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its
  peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is now in perfect
  condition to be used in a dough. It's best if you have already
  weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before
  the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses
  too much.
  
  If you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the
  day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise
  there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe.
  Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by
  using warm water (85 to 90 degrees) in the dough instead of the cool
  water specified in the recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered,
  until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours)-but
  don't let it collapse to much before you use it.
  
  DOUGH ROLLS
  
  This recipe can be divided into 2 dozen pieces and shaped into rolls.
  
  Place in a square pan with rolls touching and sprinkle with oats. Let
  rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours and bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for
  10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 375 degrees and bake for 15 to 20
  minutes. BAKERS' DOZEN AMY SCHERBER SHOW #BD1A53 Copyright, 1997, TV

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S PECAN STICKY BUNS
 Categories: Breads, Dessert
      Yield: 9 Large buns
 
  2 1/4 ts Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  (2 ounces) very warm water
           (105 to 115 degrees F)
  5 1/3 c  (24 ounces) unbleached
           All-purpose flour
  2 1/4 ts Kosher salt
      2 c  (16 ounces) warm water (90
           Degrees F)
      9 tb (4 1/2 ounces) unsalted
           Butter
    1/2 c  Plus 1 tablespoon(5 ounces)
           Dark brown sugar, firmly
           Packed
      4 tb (2 ounces)unsalted butter,
           Softened
    2/3 c  Plus 1 tablespoon (2 3/4
           Ounces) pecan pieces
           Toasted
    1/3 c  Plus 1 tablespoon (2 1/2
           Ounces) granulated sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
 
  Equipment: One 9-inch square baking pan, preferably non-stick,
  buttered on sides only; one sheet pan, lined with aluminum foil
  
  Place the yeast and warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to
  dissolve the yeast. Allow it to stand for about 3 minutes. Mix the
  flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the warm water and the
  yeast mixture and stir with your fingers to moisten the flour,
  scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself
  until it gathers into a shaggy mass.
  
  Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand for 5
  minutes. This is a soft, moist dough. If the dough seems too stiff
  and hard to knead, add extra warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until
  you get a nice malleable dough. Gently shape the dough into a loose
  ball, cover it with plastic, and let it rest on the table for 20
  minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.)
  
  Gently knead the dough on the lightly floured surface for 1 to 2 more
  minutes, or until it becomes smooth, supple, and elastic but not too
  firm. The texture of the dough should be soft but springy. Shape the
  dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn
  to coat the top with oil. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let
  it rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F)until it has doubled
  in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours
  
  While the dough is rising; in a small saucepan, heat the 9 tablespoons
  butter and the dark brown sugar over low heat, stirring occasionally,
  until the butter has melted and the sugar is completely moistened (it
  won't be dissolved), then whisk until the mixture looks silky and a
  little lighter in color. Use 1 tablespoon softened butter to grease
  the sides of a 9-inch square pan, then pour in the caramel, tilting
  the pan slightly so the mixture spreads evenly over the bottom of the
  pan. Sprinkle the toasted pecans over the warm caramel and press them
  down slightly. Put the pan in the refrigerator to cool the caramel;
  be the pan's on a level surface. Put the granulated sugar and
  cinnamon in a small bowl and stir until evenly mixed. Set aside.
  
  When the dough has doubled, gently pour it out of the bowl onto the
  floured work surface. Flatten the dough and stretch it with your
  fingers to form a 13 by 10-inch rectangle, with a long side facing
  you. Work gently so you don't tear the dough surface. The dough
  should stretch easily at this point, but if it resists, let it rest
  for 5 minutes and resume stretching. Check to be sure the dough isn't
  sticking to the work surface; flour the table again, if necessary.
  
  Spread 3 tablespoons of the softened butter evenly over the the dough,
  leaving a 1/2-inch strip unbuttered along the top edge. Sprinkle the
  cinnamon/sugar mixture generously and evenly over the butter, again
  leaving the top 1/2-inch of the rectangle bare. Starting with the
  bottom edge, roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion into a long log. If
  the dough sticks to the table as you're rolling, use a dough scraper
  to loosen it gently. Pinch gently but firmly along the seam to seal
  it. If necessary, gently shape the roll so it is a nice uniform log.
  
  Take the caramel-lined pan out of the refrigerator. Cut the log of
  dough into 9 equal pieces. (It's easiest to mark the roll first to
  show where you're going to make the cuts--a slight indentation with
  the knife edge will do--then use a sharp serrated knife to cut
  completely through the dough.) Lay the pieces cut side down on top of
  the caramel. Don't worry if it's a tight fit. Let rise, uncovered, at
  room temperature until the dough has almost doubled, about 1 to 1 1/4
  hours. The rolls should fill the pan and extend 1/2 to 3/4-inch above
  it. In the meantime, position a rack in the center of the oven and
  preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the pan of sticky buns on a
  foil-lined baking sheet and place it in the oven. Bake for 10
  minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake
  for 30 to 40 minutes longer, until the tops of the buns are golden
  brown and crusty. It's important to bake the buns long enough so the
  dough is cooked all the way through and the caramel topping develops
  properly. Set the pan of buns on a rack to cool for 5 minutes. Then
  quickly but carefully turn the pan upside down and release the sticky
  buns onto a large flat heat proof plate. Immediately scrape out any
  caramel remaining and spread it on top of the buns, filling in any
  bare spots. Let them cool until just warm before serving.

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S ROSEMARY FOUGASSE - TVFN
 Categories: Bread
      Yield: 1 Fougasse
 
    1/2    Batch Amy's Crusty Italian
           Bread
      3 tb Fresh rosemary, chopped
 
  A variation on the Crusty Italian Bread.  Mix the dough according to
  the instructions given in the recipe.
  
  After the dough has taken its first rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (or
  overnight) it can be shaped into a fougasse. Place the dough on a
  lightly floured surface and pat it into a long narrow rectangle.
  Sprinkle a layer of chopped rosemary over the surface of the dough
  being careful to cover the edges too. Fold the dough in thirds like a
  business letter, the top third over the middle of the dough, then the
  bottom third over that, completely overlapping the two. Press the 3
  open sides of the fougasse tightly shut. Cover the bread well with
  plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.
  Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack
  just below the stone.
  
  Sprinkle a peel or upside-down baking sheet generously with cornmeal
  and place the fougasse on top, stretching it slightly to make it into
  a square. Cut a decorative pattern, such as a leaf or a ladder, into
  the dough with a dough cutter. Spread and stretch the loaf until the
  cuts form large openings.
  
  Be sure the fougasse is loosened from the peel, then carefully slide
  it onto the baking stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the
  bread with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist
  again after 1 minute. Then mist again 1 minute later.
  
  Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees
  and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaf sounds slightly hollow
  when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown.
  (If the crust is not brown enough, the bread will soften as it
  cools.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes
  before serving.

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S SPONGE STARTER - TVFN
 Categories: Bread, Starter
      Yield: 1 Starter
 
  1 1/2 c  (12 ounces) very warm water
           (105 to 115 degrees)
    1/4 ts Active dry yeast
  3 1/2 c  (16 ounces) unbleached
           All-purpose flour
      1    2 quart clear plastic
           Container
 
  Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously
  with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes, until a smooth, somewhat
  elastic batter has formed. The batter will be very stiff; it gets
  softer and more elastic after it has proofed. You may find it easier
  to mix the sponge using electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough
  hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the sponge into a
  2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this
  point you have two options:
  
  If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge
  rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it
  just begins to collapse. This may take from 6 to 8 hours, depending
  on the temperature of the sponge, the temperature of the room, and
  the strength of the yeast. The sponge will triple in volume and small
  dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its
  peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is now in perfect
  condition to be used in a dough. It's best if you have already
  weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before
  the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses
  too much.
  
  If you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the
  day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise
  there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe.
  Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by
  using warm water (85 to 90 degrees) in the dough instead of the cool
  water specified in the recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered,
  until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours)-but
  don't let it collapse to much before you use it.

      Title: AMY SCHERBER'S TOASTY SEEDED BREAD STICKS - T
 Categories: Bread
      Yield: 12 Sticks
 
    1/2    Recipe baguette dough
    1/3 c  (3 ounces) sesame seeds
    1/4 c  (2 ounces) poppy seeds
      2    Or 3 tablespoons extra
           Virgin olive oil
           Kosher salt for sprinkling
 
  Mix the baguette dough using the instructions in the recipe. Divide
  the dough in half and use the other half for baguettes. Dust your
  work surface with flour and place the kneaded dough on the floured
  surface. Cover the dough with oiled plastic wrap and allow it to rise
  at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) for 1 hour. The dough will
  be soft but will not have doubled.
  
  Combine the sesame and poppy seeds in a small bowl. Pat the dough
  into an even 4 by 6 inch rectangle. Using a plant sprayer, generously
  mist the dough. Coat both sides of the dough completely with the seed
  mixture; make sure there are no bare spots. Gently brush the dough on
  both sides with olive oil and sprinkle it with kosher salt.
  
  Line 2 baking pans with parchment paper and oil the paper lightly.
  Stretch the rectangle so that it is a little longer. Using a dough
  cutter, cut the dough width-wise into twelve strips, almost 1 inch
  wide. Lift each stick, stretch it slightly so it's 8 inches long and
  lay it on the baking sheet. Place the sticks on the baking sheet with
  about 1 inch between them. Let rise for 30 minutes, until they become
  slightly puffy but not quite fully doubled.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place a
  baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan
  directly below the stone. Place the pan of bread on the baking stone.
  Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and
  immediately shut the oven door. After about 1 minute, mist the sticks
  with water 6 to 8 times, then quickly shut the oven door. Mist again
  after 1 more minute.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees

      Title: AN ABSOLUTELY PERFECT ROAST GOOSE!+
 Categories: Info/help, Alt./birds, Holidays
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    10 to 12 lb. goose either
           -fresh or frozen and thawed
 
  I have made a Thanksgiving goose every year for at least 15 years. I
  have steadily gained on making the perfect bird but I finally found
  the greatest recipe ever in Cook's Magazine. The divine part of this
  approach to cooking the goose is that it employs some of the eastern
  method of drying the skin which is used in Peking Duck. The skin
  simply drops all its fat and leaves a crispy, dry, delectable skin
  that folks fight over! No more rubbery, yucky goose skin full of fat!
  
  A frozen goose is perfectly adequate. Have thawed 24 to 48 hours
  before the meal (48 is better.) Prick the goose well all over,
  especially on the breast and on the upper legs, holding the skewer
  almost paralel with the bird so as to avoid piercing the flesh. Fill
  a very large pot 2/3 full of water (pot should be large enough to
  almost accomodate the bird) and bring to a boil. Using rubber gloves
  submerge bird (neck side down) for 1 minute (till goose bumps arise.)
  Repeat the process (this time with the tail side down.) Drain the
  goose, breast side up on a rack in a large roasting pan and set in
  the refrigerator, naked, to dry the skin for 24 to 48 hours.
  
  When you are ready to roast the bird, on the big day. Make your
  favorite stuffing. I made one in "94" that seemed to be well liked.
  The night before Thanksgiving I cooked 1 1/2 cups (raw) wild rice in
  about 5 cups of water. Drained and chilled overnight. In the morning
  I added soaked, cut up dry shitake mushrooms along with their soaking
  water with an egg beaten into it. A tablespoon of poultry seasoning,
  a sauteed onion, plenty of salt and freshly ground pepper.
  
  Now you salt and pepper the bird insdie and out, liberally. Preheat
  the oven to 325 degrees while you are stuffing and sewing up the
  bird. Place it in the oven in a roaster and on a rack on it's breast.
  For a 12 1/3 lb. goose I needed a full 5 hours but this is quite a
  large bird. Just close the oven and let it stay, undisturbed for 1
  1/2 hours. After this time, take it out of the oven. Use a baster to
  draw out the fat that has accumulated in the bottom of the pan
  (schmaltz lovers, send up a cheer) You can strain this fat through a
  coffee filter, putting the schmaltz in small bottles which keep very
  well in the freezer for up to a year.) Turn the bird over on its back
  before you put it back in the oven. put it back in for another hour
  before you start checking for doneness. The recipe gave the best
  advice on checking for doneness, at this point, that I have ever
  seen. With a piece of terry rag, squeeze the upper drumstick (not
  thigh) lightly. If it feels kind of squishy, like roast beef, it's
  done. Every bird is different so you must judge when it is done. When
  meat is done (be patient, it may take a while), raise the heat to 400
  degrees. Remove roaster from the oven and transfer bird (rack and
  all) to a jelly roll pan. Put it back in the oven for 15 minutes to
  further crisp and brown the bird. Take it out and let it sit,
  uncovered for a half an hour.
  
  Regarding the roaster, after you remove the bird to a jelly roll pan
  and put that in the oven, remove the fat from the roaster and put it
  over 2 burners adding about 2/3 cup of dry sherry and deglaze the pan
  with a wooden spoon. combine these drippings with your giblet broth
  either to make a gravy or to use later for goose carcass, slow cooker
  broth.
  
  There is more on the subject, if you wish to know more check out the
  Nov-Dec. issue of Cook's Magazine on pp. 6-8

  Blend the walnuts, rice, bacon bits, BBQ sauce, and spices into a

  that it forms a workable dough. Shape into patties and sprinkle flour
  onto the outsides of the patties. Refrigerate for at least one hour.
  Fry, or grill, or bake (they hold together reasonably well on the
  grill, only slightly more crumbly than an actual hamburger is.)
  
  Serve with extra BBQ sauce on a bun, perhaps with onion, lettuce,
  tomato, or whatever else you want on it. Makes six.

      Title: ANADAMA RAISIN BATTER BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Water
      1 c  Corn meal, preferably yellow
           -and stone-ground
      3 tb Sweet butter
    1/2 c  Molasses
    1/2 c  Warm water
      2 tb Dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar or honey
      2 ts Salt
  5 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
           -(approx)
      1 c  Gold raisins
 
  Makes 2 loaves.
  
  IN a good-sized saucepan bring the milk and 1 cup water to a boil.
  Turn off the heat and sprinkle in the corn meal, stirring
  energetically with a wire whisk or fork. Add the butter and molasses
  and stir until evenly mixed. Cool to lukewarm.
  
  In a large mixing bowl dissolve the yeast in the half-cup warm water
  with the sugar or honey.  When bubbly, add cornmeal mixture, salt,
  and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. It should be thick but still beatable.
  Beat 5 minutes with an electric mixer.
  
  Stir in the raisins.  Gradually add 2/12 to 3 cups more flour,
  beating with a large spoon until the battter is too stiff to continue
  beating and holds together in a mass in the center of the bowl.
  
  Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let it sit until the dough has
  risen to twice its original volume. Stir down with the spoon. If you
  wish, let it rise a second time. Stir down. Divide the dough between
  two buttered large loaf pans.  Be sure you get equal amounts in each
  pan. Squish it into the corners with your fingers. Press to smooth
  the tops a bit; don't worry if they look like a lava flow.
  
  Cover the pans with a towel and let rise until batter reaches the
  tops of the pans.  Preheat oven to 350F. Bake 40 - 45 minutes, until
  the loaves are brown but don't quite have a hollow sound when tapped
  on the bottoms. Remove them from the pans and put directly on the
  oven rack. Bake another 5 minutes to crisp the crust.
  
  Cool on a rack.

  Soak the beans overnight in water to cover.  In the morning rinse the
  beans with cold water and place in a large pot with fresh water to
  cover. Stir in the salt, cover and simmer slowly 2 to 2 1/2 hours,
  until the beans are tender.  Add water when necessary and stir
  occasionally to prevent the beans from burning.
  
  Add hominy and simmer, covered, 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  The

  Most southwestern Indians grow beans.  The Hopis grow a variety of
  beans in terraces along their high mesas, where the crop is irrigated
  by natural springs.  After the harvest the beans are dried and
  stored. Some beans are used for ceremonial purposes - from weddings
  to Kachina dances - while others are used for their day-to-day meals.
  
  For suburban and city dwellers, I've found that pinto beans, white
  beans, or red beans work well, but I suggest you also experiment with
  some of the other varieties of beans - like anasazi beans - that are
  now available commercially.  Or you may want to be adventuresome and
  grow your own variety.  To round out this meal, the beans can be
  served with Lamb Stuffed Green Chiles, Pan Fried Trout, or Venison

  ***Note***  Anasazi, Navajo for "the ancient ones" is the name given
  to the Native Americans who created the cliff dwellings in the
  Southwest. The sweet-tasting anasazi bean, one of the first foods
  cultivated by Native Americans, is high in protein and other
  nutrients. It also has a beautiful color.

      Title: ANASAZI BEANS WITH JUNIPER
 Categories: Beans, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Dried Anasazi or pinto beans
     10    Coriander seeds
      8    Juniper berries
      1 sm Onion
      1 tb Sunflower seed or light
           -olive oil
      1 ts Ground red chile (opt)
      1 ts Dried Mexican or Greek
           -oregano
  2 1/2 qt Water
           Salt
 
  Uncomplicated and satisfying, this recipe for anasazi beans is from
  Deborah Madison's "The Savory Way."
  
  You can find juniper berries in the spice section of specialty food
  markets.
  
  Sort through the beans, rinse them well, cover them with cold water,
  and set them aside for six hours or overnight. (Or use the
  quick-soaking method.)
  
  Bruise the seeds and berries in a mortar, and chop the onion into
  small squares.
  
  Warm the oil in a wide-bottomed soup pot; add the onions, coriander
  seeds, juniper berries, chile and oregano. Cook together over medium
  heat for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Drain the beans and add them to the pot along with the fresh water.
  Bring to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer for 40 minutes. Add
  salt to taste and continue cooking until the beans are as tender as
  you like them ~ probably another 30 minutes or so. When done, check
  the seasoning. Serve the beans in a bowl with the broth.
  
  Suggestion: There are lots of tasty additions you can use - cilantro,
  mint, scallions, sour cream, cheese and so on. But try the beans
  plain first.

      Title: ANASAZI-TOFU ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Beans, Rice, Vegetarian, Mexican
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 c  Slightly pureed Anasazi
           Beans *
    1/2 c  Cooked rice
    1/2 c  Tofu, excess water removed
    1/4 c  Chopped bell pepper
    1/4 c  Chopped green onion
      1 c  Grated cheddar
      1 c  Grated Monterey Jack
     10 oz Enchilada sauce
     10    Corn tortillas
 
  Mix first five ingredients together. Add 2 T. enchilada sauce. Moisten
  tortillas in warmed enchilada sauce. Fill tortilla with mixture and
  roll. Place in greased 6 1/2" X 10 1/2" pan with the opening of the
  roll down. Any remaining sauce should be poured on top of the
  enchiladas once the pan is filled. Place cheeses on top and bake at
  300 degrees F for 35-40 minutes.
  
  *  "Anasazi" is a Navajo word meaning "ancient one." Anasazi beans
  have been found in many southwestern Indian dwellings. Bean
  connoisseurs will appreciate the characteristic taste and texture
  talents of pinto and kidney combined within this ancient Indian
  entrant. Versatility of this variety is limited only by your
  imagination: take them for a "dip": enlist them for creative Mexican
  food construction: they even taste good straight!

  Bar in Buffalo.
  
     The Sauce This makes enough for about 30 "wingettes". Mix all the
  ingredients in a small sauce pan over low heat until the margarine is
  completely melted. Sti occasionally.
  
     The Wings Fry the wings in a deep fryer set at 375 degrees F.,
  using vegetable or peanut oil. I fry 15 wings at a time for 12-15
  minutes. Drain the wings for wings have been fried, pour the sauce
  over them, cover the bowl, and shake to completely coat the wings.
  They can be eaten now, or you can put them o for a few minutes to get
  an extra-crispy coating. Serve with carrot and cel beer (Genee Cream
  Ale is traditional). ** (FRANK'S, now Durkee's)

      Title: ANCHOR BAR HOT WINGS
 Categories: Appetizers, Poultry
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Chicken wings
           Read below
 
  The following was originally posted by G.SCHAEFFER GBGM64A. The key
  to good Buffalo Wings is how you prepare them as well as the
  ingredients and the handling of the wings.  The most successful wings
  served up here in Buffalo are what they call "Grade A Grinders."
  Fresh wings that are very large and meaty. Usually, you cannot get
  them in a frozen package, but can get them from a poultry dealer.
  Once you find them make sure they are absolutely fresh.  Wash them in
  cold water, split them at the joint and remove the tips. Place them
  on a rack on a pan and refrigerate overnight to let the blood and
  water drain out of the wings. THIS IS A REAL KEY. Drying the wings
  under refrigeration will help to make them a much crispier product,
  once deep fried. Next, use a deep fryer or a very heavy deep pot with
  a thermometer and add the oil. Peanut oil is very good, or a
  commercial product such as can be found at a restaurant cash and
  carry called Mel Fry. Heat the oil up SLOWLY, to 365F, and depending
  on the size of the fryer, deep fry the dry wings 6-8 minutes in small
  batches, until thoroughly done and golden brown. Hold the cooked
  wings in a warm oven if necessary. A combination of melted margarine
  and hot sauce in the ratio of 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot sauce
  will add the right zing. The key here is to add just enough sauce to
  coat the wings - the more sauce you add, the hotter they will be.
  For the very brave, 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot sauce and 1 part
  Tabasco is referred to as "Suicidal Wings" by the late and dear Don
  Bellissimo, who owned the Anchor Bar. Working quickly, place the deep
  fried wings in a large bowl and add the sauce mixture, shaking to
  coat them. There are many good hot sauces to use; the one they use is
  either Durkee Franks Red Hot Sauce or Wingers Original, again found
  in a restaurant cash and carry. Celery sticks and chunky blue cheese
  dressing (Ken's Buffalo Style Blue Cheese is a popular one) and
  plenty of napkins.

      Title: ANCO CHILI DEVIL'S FOOD CUPCAKES WITH ROASTED
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 9 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------FOR THE CAKE-----------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Cake Flour
    1/2 c  Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
      3 tb Ancho chili powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Salt
     10 tb Unsalted butter at room temp
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Large eggs
    1/2 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  Hot dark coffee
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE TOPPING---------------------------
    1/2 c  Lightly rosasted Macadamias
           - whole or chopped (about
           - 2 oz.)
      4 oz Semisweet chocolate, chopped
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
 
  [Note:  Bobby Flay, chef of NYC's Mesa Grill, prepared this dessert
  for a Meals on Wheels benefit meal at the Frontera Grill in Chicago.
  Blended with the cocoa and coffee, the chili powder is only mildly
  hot and adds something approximating a fruit flavor.]
  
  1.  Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 9" square cake pan, line the
  bottom with parchment or waxed paper and butter the paper. Measure
  out cake flour, cocoa, chili powder, baking soda, salt, baking
  powder, and cayenne.
   Sift them together 3 times. 2. Using an electric mixer with a large
  bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat
  in the eggs, one at a time, and continue beating until mixture is
  light, fluffy and almost tripled in volume. 3. Fold 1/3 dry mixture
  into the butter-egg mixture, then add 1/2 the buttermilk and 1/2 the
  coffee. Fold in another 1/3 of the dry mixture then the remaining
  buttermilk and coffee. Finish with the remaining dry dry mixture and
  the vanilla extract. 4. Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Bake
  until cake springs back when touched lightly (30 - 35 min.).  Then
  turn out of pan and leave on the rack until completely cool. 5. Use a
  2-1/2 inch cookie cutter to cut rounds from the cake. Place the
  rounds in paper cupcake liners. 6. Make the topping: If the
  macadamias are raw, roast them in a 350 degree oven, turning once,
  until they just begin to color. Place the chopped chocolate in a
  bowl, heat the whipping cream tii the point of a bowl and pour it
  over the chocolate. Let cool to warm then drizzle it over the
  cupcakes. Top with macadamia nuts.
  
  [Note: Ancho chili powder can be made by stemming and seeding whole
  ancho chilies and pulverizing them in an electric spice mill or
  coffee grinder. The poweder should be available at markets featuring
  Soutwestern ingredients or may be ordered by mail from G.B. Ratto &
  Co., 800-325-3483.]

 Categories: Beef, Salads, Tex-mex, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------PATTI-VDRJ67A----------------------------
      2 lb Ground beef
      1 pk Taco seasoning
      8 oz Sharp cheddar cheese; shred
    1/2    Head of lettuce; cut finely
      2    Tomaotes; chopped up
      1    Onion; chopped fine
      1    Pace picante sauce, HOT
      1 pt Sour cream
      1 pk Unflavored taco chips -OR-
           - Taco salad bowls - shells
           - to be baked in oven
 
  Number one rule, invite friends over!!! Have a pitcher of margaritas
  made and the beer cold!! Once friends arrive, start the festivities.
  Put everyone to work. Brown the ground beef and drain; add the taco
  seasoning and water according to the packet directions. While doing
  this, have someone else chop the veggies and shred the cheese. If
  using the taco salad bowls, bake them in the oven. If using taco
  chips, smash them up. While working, pour margaritas and beers and
  take sips every now and then. Supply bowls to place all the
  ingredients in separately. When everything is done and ready to go,
  sit down at table. Make sure everyone has a beer or margarita!! Pass
  everything around and let everyone make their own mess (salad). One
  last important thing - the GUYS get clean up duty!!!

      3 ts Salt
 
  Wash and soak the rice in water for 1/2 hour. Drain off the water and
  tie the rice into a cloth. Add the meat to a mixture of the yogurt
  and 2 tsp salt and set aside. Saute the chiles in 1 TBS ghee. Mix the
  chiles, ginger, garlic, and half the cinnamon, cloves and cardamom
  together and grind into a fine paste. Rub the ground spices into the
  meat. Heat half the remaining ghee and add the meat and spice/yogurt
  mixture and half the onions and cook over a low fire until the meat
  is tender. Heat the remaining ghee and add the remaining cinnamon,
  cloves and cardamom. After they have cooked for a few minutes add the
  rest of the onions and fry until they are golden brown. Add the rice
  and fry it until it is slightly brown. At this point, add the 6 cups
  boiling water, and then the turmeric and remaining salt. Let the rice
  mixture cook until the water is almost level with the grains (the
  rice should be half done by then) and then add the meat and its
  gravy. Do not mix them, but, after placing a tight lid on the pot,
  let the biriyani simmer for 15-20 minutes. After this, mix well and
  serve. Serves 8. This is almost a complete meal by itself, although
  pickles, chutneys and vegetables dishes would probably be served with
  it. Heat scale: Hot. ANDHRA MUTTON BIRIYANI

 Categories: Cajun, Meats, Appetizers
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
  1 1/2 ea Yards large sausage casing,
      1 x  About 2-3 inches wide
      4 lb Lean fresh pork
      2 lb Pork fat
  3 1/3 tb Finely minced garlic
      2 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/8 ts Cayenne
    1/8 ts Chili powder
    1/8 ts Mace
    1/8 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 tb Paprika
    1/4 ts Ground bay leaf
    1/4 ts Sage 5
      1 x  Colgin's liquid hickory smok
 
  Andouille was a great favorite in nineteenth-century New Orleans. This
  thick Cajun sausage is made with lean pork and pork fat and lots fo
  garlic. Sliced about 1/2 inch thick and greilled, it makes a
  delightful appetizer. It is also used in a superb oyster and
  andouille gumbo poplular in Laplace, a Cajun town about 30 miles from
  New Orleans that calls itself the Andouille Capital of the World.
  (about 6 pounds of 20 inch sausage, 3 to 3 1/2 inches thick)
    Soak the casing about an hour in cold water to soften it and to
  loosen the salt in which it is packed. Cut into 3 yard lengths, then
  place the narrow end of the sausage stuffer in one end of the casing.
  Place the wide end of the stuffer up against the sink faucet and run
  cold water through the inside of the casing to remove any salt. (Roll
  up the casing you do not intend to use; put about 2 inches of coarse
  salt in a large jar, place the rolled up casing on it, then fill the
  rest of the jar with salt. Close tightly and refrigerate for later
  use.)
    Cut the meat and fat into chunks about 1/2 inch across and pass once
  through the coarse blade of the meat grinder. Combine the pork with
  the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well with a wooden
  spoon. Cut the casings into 26 inch lengths and stuff as follows: Tie
  a knot in each piece of casing about 2 inches from one end. Fit the
  open end over the tip of  the sausage stuffer and slide it to about 1
  inch from the wide end. Push  the rest of the casing onto the stuffer
  until the top touches the knot.   (The casing will look like
  accordian folds on the stuffer.) Fit the stuffer  onto the meat
  grinder as directed on the instructions that come with the  machine,
  or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over the opeoning by
  hand. Fill the hopper with stuffing.  Turn the machine on if it is
  electric  and feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper; for a
  manual machine, push  the stuffing through with a wooden pestle. The
  sausage casing will fill and inflate gradually. Stop filling about 1
  1/4 inches from the funnel end and slip the casing off the funnel,
  smoothing out any bumps carefully with your fingers and being careful
  not to push the stuffing out of the casing. Tie off the open end of
  the sausage tightly with a piece of string or make a knot in the
  casing itself. Repeat until all the stuffing is used up.
    To cook, slice the andouille 1/2 inch thick and grill in a hot
  skillet with no water for about 12 minutes on each side, until brown
  and crisp at the edges. From: Ellen Cleary

 Categories: Sausages
      Yield: 6 Lbs
 
  1 1/2    Yd large sausage casing
           Approx (2-3 in wide)
      4 lb Lean fresh pork
      2 lb Pork fat
  3 1/3 tb Finely minced garlic
      2 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Fresh grnd black pepper
    1/8 ts Cayenne
    1/8 ts Chili powder
    1/8 ts Mace
    1/8 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 tb Paprika
    1/4 ts Ground bay leaf
    1/4 ts Sage
      5 ts Liquid hickory smoke
 
  Andouille was a great favorite in nineteenth-century New Orleans. This
  thick Cajun sausage is made with lean pork and pork fat and lots of
  garlic. Sliced about 1/2 inch thick and greilled, it makes a
  delightful appetizer. It is also used in a superb oyster and
  andouille gumbo poplular in Laplace, a Cajun town about 30 miles from
  New Orleans that calls itself the Andouille Capital of the World.
  
  Soak the casing about an hour in cold water to soften it and to
  loosen the salt in which it is packed.  Cut into 3 yard lengths, then
  place the narrow end of the sausage stuffer in one end of the casing.
  Place the wide end of the stuffer up against the sink faucet and run
  cold water through the inside of the casing to remove any salt. (Roll
  up the casing you do not intend to use; put about 2 inches of coarse
  salt in a large jar, place the rolled up casing on it, then fill the
  rest of the jar with salt. Close tightly and refrigerate for later
  use.)
  
  Cut the meat and fat into chunks about 1/2 inch across and pass once
  through the coarse blade of the meat grinder. Combine the pork with
  the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well with a wooden
  spoon. Cut the casings into 26 inch lengths and stuff as follows: Tie
  a knot in each piece of casing about 2 inches from one end. Fit the
  open end over the tip of the sausage stuffer and slide it to about 1
  inch from the wide end. Push the rest of the casing onto the stuffer
  until the top touches the knot. (The casing will look like accordian
  folds on the stuffer.) Fit the stuffer onto the meat grinder as
  directed on the instructions that come with the machine, or hold the
  wide end of the stuffer against or over the opeoning by  hand. Fill
  the hopper with stuffing. Turn the machine on if it is electric  and
  feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper; for a manual machine,
  push the stuffing through with a wooden pestle. The sausage casing
  will fill and inflate gradually.  Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches
  from the funnel end and slip the casing off the funnel, smoothing out
  any bumps carefully with your fingers and being careful not to push
  the stuffing out of the casing.  Tie off the open end of the sausage
  tightly with a piece of string or make a knot in the casing itself.
  Repeat until all the stuffing is used up.
  
  To cook, slice the andouille 1/2 inch thick and grill in a hot
  skillet with no water for about 12 minutes on each side, until brown
  and crisp at the edges.
  
  (about 6 pounds of 20 inch sausage, 3 to 3 1/2 inches thick)

      2 tb Cayenne pepper
      1 tb Dry thyme
      4 tb Salt
      6    Feet beef middle casing (see
           -butcher or
           Specialty shop)
 
  Andouille is the Cajun smoked sausage so famous nationally today.
  Made with pork butt, shank and a small amount of pork fat, this
  sausage is seasoned with salt, cracked black pepper and garlic. The
  andouille is then slowly smoked over pecan wood and sugar cane. True
  andouille is stuffed into the beef middle casing which makes the
  sausage approximately one and a half inches in diameter. When smoked,
  it becomes very dark to almost black in color. It is not uncommon for
  the Cajuns to smoke andouille for seven to eight hours at
  approximately 175 degrees. Traditionally, the andouilles from France
  were made from the large intestines and stomach of the pig, seasoned
  heavily and smoked. In parts of Germany, where some say andouille
  originated, the sausage was made with all remaining intestines and
  casings pulled through a larger casing, seasoned and smoked. It was
  served thinly sliced as an hors d'oeuvre. It is interesting to note
  that the finest andouille in France comes from the Brittany and
  Normandy areas. It is believed that over half of the Acadian exiles
  who came to Louisiana in 1755 were originally from these coastal
  regions. Cube pork butt into one and a half inch cubes. Using a meat
  grinder with four one quarter inch holes in the grinding plate, grind
  pork and pork fat. If you do not have a grinding plate this size, I
  suggest hand cutting pork butt into one quarter inch square pieces.
  Place ground pork in large mixing bowl and blend in all remaining
  ingredients. Once well blended, stuff meat into casings in one foot
  links, using the sausage attachement on your meat grinder. Tie both
  ends of the sausage securely using a heavy gauge twine. In your
  homestyle smoker, smoke andouille at 175-200 degrees F for
  approximately four to five hours using pecan or hickory wood. The
  andouille may then be frozen and used for seasoning gumbos, white or
  red beans, pastas or grilling as an hors d'oeuvre. Recipe by: Chef

      Title: ANDOUILLE-TASSO DRESSING
 Categories: Dressings, Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Andouille - finely chopped
    1/2 c  Tasso - finely chopped
      4 c  Chicken stock
      1    Pan cornbread
           - about 9-inch pan
      4 tb Margarine
      1 c  Onions - finely chopped
    1/2 c  Green onions - finely
           -chopped
    1/2 c  Celery - finely chopped
    1/2 c  Mushrooms - fresh, sliced
    1/4 c  Parsley - finely chopped
    1/4 c  Bell pepper - finely
           -chopped
      2 ts Garlic - finely chopped
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Black pepper
 
  Start off by baking your cornbread to package directions (be sure you
  choose an unsweetened cornbread mix) and letting it cool to room
  temperature.  Then, to a 2-1/2-quart saucepan, bring the chicken
  stock to a boil, toss in the finely chopped andouille and tasso,
  reduce the heat, and simmer for about 1 hour until the meats are soft
  and tender.
  
  Meanwhile, take a 12-inch skillet and melt the margarine over medium
  heat. Then quickly saute the onions, green onions, celery, mushrooms,
  bell pepper, parsley and garlic until all of them are just wilted ~-
  DO NOT OVERCOOK!
  
  Next, take a mixing bowl and crumble the cornbread. Then stir in the
  sauteed vegetable mixture and all of the meats and blend everything
  thoroughly.
  
  At this point, begin adding the meat stock you made - a little at a
  time -- to moisten the dressing. Remember... you want the stuffing
  "just moist" -- not wet! And you want to taste the stuffing before
  adding any salt and pepper.  There may already be enough in the tasso
  and andouille to suit you.
  
  Use with Stuffed Veal Pocket.
  
  NOTE:  The best way to enhance the flavor of a traditional New
  Orleans veal pocket is to stuff it with a cornbread dressing spiced
  up with andouille and tasso.

  Here is a recipe, developed young man here in the Detroit area. With
  this recipe, he won a $10,000 scholarship to Johnson and Wales
  College, which is considered a top-notch cooking school, located in
  Charleston, SC. This young man, Andre Black, spent 2 weeks developing
  this recip, this cake was among the top 19 recipes chosen <out of
  270> as winners. Andre was on the front page of the Detroit News
  yesterday, along with the recipe. The Detroit News food writer, Robin
  Mather says "For a Carrot Cake, this is a hell of a fruit cake. She
  found this cake suited to 3 8" layers.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Grease and flour three 8" layer pans. Combine
  eggs, sugar and oil.  Beat on high speed until creamy and thick, 3-5
  minutes. Sift together flour, cinnamon, salt and baking soda. Slowly
  add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to egg mixture; beat well. Repeat with
  remaining dry ingredients, beating well after each addition. Batter
  will be extrememly stiff; it may be necessary to blend with a spatula
  or spoon. One by one, fold in carrots, coconut, pineapple, walnuts
  and raisins.
  
  Divide batter between the 3 prepared cake pans.  Bake at 350 for 40-45
  minutes, arranging cake pans in oven once. The cake is done when the
  tester inserted in center comes out clean. Let cake cool in pans 5
  minutes. Turn out onto rack to cool completely.
  
  When cakes are cool, prepare frosting: combine margarine, cream
  cheese, sugar and vanilla.  Beat until smooth. Frost cake.
  
  * Andre's original recipe, written in professional baking terms,
  calls for 6 oz beaten eggs, 15 1/2 oz of sugar, and 12 oz cake flour
  
  Andre hopes tobbecome an executive chef, and own his own resturant
  someday.

  Slice the meat when it is lightly frozen. The cuts should be long,
  thin and with the grain. Cut across the grain if you want more
  tender, but more brittle jerky.
  
  Trim off all of the fat. Marinate strips in a glass container
  overnight. You may substitute 2 cups of red wine for the corn whiskey
  and water.
  
  Pat dry and arrange pieces side by side on an oven roasting rack,
  with- out overlap. Cook at minimum heat (150F) for 6 hours. Leave
  oven door ajar to allow moisture to escape. Meat should be dark, dry

      Title: ANDREA'S WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
 Categories: Pudding
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
      1 lb White chocolate
      1 c  Whipping cream
      3    Eggs; separated
    1/4 c  Brandy
    1/4 c  Hot water
      1 tb Vanilla
      2 oz Sugar
 
  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over medium-low heat. It's a
  good idea to stand over the chocolate while it's melting and stir
  until it has melted completely; take it off the heat immediately.
  
  Whip the cream and set aside.
  
  Pour the brandy and hot water slowly into a bowl with the egg yolks,
  whisking briskly as you go until completely mixed. Whisk in the melted
  chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is completely
  combined; this will help cool the chocolate.
  
  Whip the egg whites and the sugar, adding the vanilla as you beat,
  until peaking but not dry. Fold the egg-white meringue into the
  chocolate mixture carefully with a wooden spoon. Fold in the whipped
  cream. This is the most critical part of the recipe. The key to a
  great chocolate mousse is incorporating cooled chocolate into whipped
  cream. The chocolate must be cool to the touch or the cream will
  separate. Lightly blend the two mixtures until uniform.
  
  The mousse is actually at its best texture as soon as mixed.

      Title: ANDY BEALS' CHILI
 Categories: Entrees
      Yield: 12 Cups
 
      5 c  Beans, canned (drained)
      6 c  Tomatoes, stewed
      2 lb Beef, cut into bite-sized
           -pieces and browned
           -(don't use ground beef)
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped
      3 md Jalapeno peppers, cut up
      2    Green bell peppers, diced
      2 md Onions, diced (or less)
           Beer, flavorful (1 bottle)
      2 tb Cumin
      2 ts Paprika
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  Saute the meat and onions.  You may do it in the same pan that you are
  going to put the chili in. The meat should be brown on the outside,
  but you don't have to cook it much at this time. Drain the fat from
  the beef.
  
  Put everything in a big pot over low heat (a slow cooker is handy)
  and stir together.  Wait half an hour to an hour and check the flavor
  of the soupy base. Adjust as you see fit. Perhaps add more beer, hot
  peppers, or spices. Repeat as necessary. Wait as long as you can,
  stirring occasionally. You may eat it when the beans and beef are
  soft. Serve with bread, fresh-baked biscuits or cornbread.
  
  This is best if it has cooked at least overnight. Generally it's
  ready for consumption after about three hours. If you can't turn your
  stove down to a very low heat, you're bound to burn the bottom of the
  chili a little, but as long as you don't scrape it off, it will taste
  okay. Slow-cookers are great in this regard!
  
  At the three hour mark, the chili is somewhat soupy. If you want it to
  thicken up, turn up the heat a bit and let it boil off the excess
  water. While doing this, stir every few minutes or you may burn the
  bottom!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Andy's own recipe for meat/bean chili -- This is the descendant of
  the chili that I've been making since 1974.
  
  *  I change the proportions of ingredients (double the beef, drop the
  beans, add LOTS more cumin) all the time; this recipe is just a
  general guideline. The amount of garlic given in the recipe is very
  conservative. Garbanzo beans (chick peas) are nice, but they take a
  lot longer to cook. Making it with lamb or Italian sausage instead of
  beef is also interesting. Cherry peppers instead of jalapeno peppers
  are very nice also.
  
  *  Do not use wimpy American beer!  I have found that Moosehead adds
  a good flavor, and I bet that Anchor Steam will too.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  :          (any color), chopped
  :     1/2 c  sliced mushrooms
  :          (canned is fine)
  :       3    stalks celery, sliced
  :       2 cl garlic, minced
  :       1 ts garlic powder
  :       1 ts oregano
  :       1 ts basil
  :       1 ts rosemary
  :     1/2 ts thyme
  :       1    dollop good olive oil
  :          X-tra Hot Sauce to taste
  :          fresh ground black pepper
  :          grated Parmesan
  :          or
  :          Romano cheese
  
  Brown the ground beef with the onions in a medium to large skillet (it
  should have a lid; alternatively, a large covered saucepan may be
  used). Drain the fat. Chop the tomatoes into bite-size pieces (do not
  drain) and add to the beef.  Add the mushrooms, celery, pepper and
  garlic. Add herbs, crushing first, making sure the rosemary needles
  are well broken-up. Add a dollop (just enough for flavor) of olive
  oil, grind some pepper on top to taste.  Finally, add the hot sauce
  to taste, remembering that the sauce simmers down and it will
  concentrate the hot stuff! Cook on medium heat for 5-10 minutes
  uncovered, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
  Uncover, and reduce sauce until it is the desired consistency. Serve
  over pasta with grated cheese and crusty bread. Heather Pierce Walt MM

      1 c  Cake Flour;sifted
  1 1/4 c  Sugar; granulated/sifted
      1 c  Egg whites
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Cream of tartar
    3/4 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Almond extract
 
  Sift flour once, measure, add 1/4 cup sugar, and sift together four
  times. Beat egg whites and salt with rotary egg beater or flat wire
  whisk. When foamy, add cream of tartar and continue beating until
  eggs are stiff enough to hold up in peaks, but not dry. Add remaining
  I cup sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating with rotary egg beater
  or whisk after each addition until sugar is just blended. Fold in
  flavoring. Then sift about 1/4 cup flour over mixture and fold in
  lightly; repeat until all is used. Turn into ungreased angel food
  pan. Cut gently through batter with knife to remove air bubbles. Bake
  in slow oven (325 degrees F) 45 to 50 minutes Remove from oven and
  invert pan 1 hour, or until cold. Spread Raspberry Icing thinly on
  top and sides of cake. Angel Food Cake is often served plain or
  sprinkled lightly with confectioners'sugar. For Large Angel Food
  Cake, use above recipe, increasing sugar and egg whites to 1 1/2 cups
  each. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar to flour and 1 1/4 cups to egg whites.
  Bake in slow oven (325 degrees F) 1 hour. Note: Remove eggs from
  refrigerator several hours be- fore using. They beat up lighter and
  more easily when at room temperature, and give increased fineness of
  grain and delicacy of texture to angel food cakes. Kate Smith

  Delicate angel hair pasta demands a light and elegant sauce, such as
  this simple white wine mixture flecked with bits of fresh tomato and
  basil. It's a terrific first course of luncheon dish. I find the
  spinach and semolina varieties to be somewhat sturdier than plain
  wheat-flour angel hair pasta, but you still need to handle them
  carefully. Cook for only 30 seconds to 1 minute, toss, and serve
  immediately.
  
  I prefer dried pasta to fresh for several reasons, not the least of
  which is that it lacks the fat and cholesterol of the fresh variety,
  which is made with eggs. Better-quality dried pastas can be purchased
  in a seemingly endless range of flavors--usually at a fraction of the
  price of fresh. They hold up to the most robust of sauces and are
  simpler to cook.
  
  If you use fresh pasta, be sure to separate the strands before adding
  them to the pot so tht they don't stick together while cooking. Time
  carefully. Fresh pasta is done in 3 to 5 minutes and can be
  overcooked easily.

      6    Or 7 brussel sprouts sliced

    1/2 c  Grated cabbage
      1 lg Or 2 sm diced tomatos

    1/2 c  Fresh grated parmeasan (sp?)
           Or romano che
           Cappelini (angelhair pasta)
 
  1.  In a skillet, sautee the garlic, onion and frying peppers in the
  olive oil until onion is transluscent (about 2 min). Add the Broccoli
  and let it cook until bright green.
  
  2.  Add the rest of the peppers and the brussel sprouts/cabbage, the
  tomatoes, basil and salt and pepper. Toss very well so the tomatoes
  have a chance to cook. Add the grouper andcover for about 5 min.
  
  3.  The liquid from the fish mixes with the tomatos for a kind of
  sauce. Add the parsley and cover until the fish is cooked all the way
  through.
  
  4.  Take off heat and mix with the cheese. Some people may like more
  than 1/2 cup of cheese so keep it handy.
  
  5.  Serve over Cappelini.
  
  Author's Notes: Here is a kind of throw together recipe I came up
  with:
  
  If you are entertaining you can garnish with fresh parsley and serve
  with a caesar salad, garlic bread and a nice chablis. The vegetables
  can vary. I've used mushrooms, spinach, cauliflower etc. Grouper
  works well with this because it has a lot of flavor. I've used fresh
  tuna and halibut but prefer grouper.
  
  Difficulty    : easy. Precision

      Title: ANGELICA (ANGELICA ARCHANGELICA)
 Categories: Seasonings, Candies
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
MMMMM-------------------CANDIED ANGELICA STEMS------------------------
           Broad green angelica stems
           Water
           -- enough to cover the stems
           Sugar; same volume as water
 
  "Angelica has a variety of culinary uses.  Its unique flavor is
  difficult to describe except by listing its components: musky,
  bitter, celerylike, aniselike, slightly sweet, fresh. The hollow
  stems are jellied or candied (see recipe below) and either eaten
  alone or used to decorate desserts. About 1/4 cup fresh angelica
  stems, cut in short pieces, can be added to rhubarb to counteract its
  tartness and reduce the necessary sugar by as much as one-third.  The
  stems and dried roots are sometimes boiled like celery and can be
  cooked with sugar like rhubarb. The slightly bitter leaves may be
  served with fish, and sometimes are candied with the stems.
  
  "Consuming large amounts of angelica can cause photosensitivity in
  some individuals, and pregnant women should avoid using any part of
  the plant. Commercially, the seeds and see oil flavor liqueurs and
  desserts, and scent cosmetics.  The pungent, juniper-flavored roots
  are used with or instead of juniper berries to flavor gin.  Arkansas
  or Quapaw Indians mixed the root of A. atropurpurea with tobacco for
  smoking. The robust angelica stalks are handsome in dried
  arrangements, and the coumarin-containing leaves sometimes serve as a
  potpourri fixative."
  
  CANDIED ANGELICA STEMS ====================== The best stems for
  candying are the new growth in the second year. Cut them into
  manageable pieces, then blanch 1-2 minutes. Peel the blanched stems,
  them cut them into pieces 2 inches long by 1/2 inch wide.  Simmer 20
  minutes in a syrup made of the sugar and water. Drain, reserving the
  syrup, and refrigerate stems and syrup, covered, for four days.
  Reheat the angelica in the syrup and cook for 20 minutes, or until
  candied. The temperature of the syrup should reach 238 F. Drain the
  angelica and dry on racks set over waxed paper. Store in airtight
  containers.
  
  [NOTE: For safety's sake, do not gather angelica in the wild. Wild
  angelica is easily confused with the deadly poisonous lookalike,
  water hemlock (Cicula maculata).]

      Title: ANGELICA TARTLETS
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 oz Home-candied angelica
      1    Shortcrust pastry *
  1 1/2 oz Butter
  1 1/2 tb Honey
    1/2 c  Curd cheese
      1    Egg yolk; mixed with:
      1 ts Milk
      1    Egg white
 
  *Note: Shortcrust pastry made with 7-8 oz flour will be about right
  for this recipe.
  
  These tarts are irresistible when made with home-candied angelica, as
  dull as ditchwater when store-bought is used. Chop the angelica into
  small pieces, cover with warm water to rinse off some of the sugar
  and set aside for a few minutes.  While the angelica soaks, line 18 x
  2 1/2 inch tartlet tins with the shortcrust pastry and start
  preparing the filling. Dice and barely melt the butter in a small
  saucepan. Away from the heat, beat in the honey, then the curd
  cheese, then the egg yolk mixed with the milk. Stir in the well
  drained angelica.  Whisk the egg white to snowy peaks and fold it in.
  Spoon the mixture into the pastry-lined tartlet tins and bake at 400
  F (200 C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes until puffed up and golden. Serve
  as soon as cooled from cooking.

 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetables, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
     12 md Globe artichokes
      1    Lemon (juice only)
           Lemon slices
      3 tb Flour (optional)
    1/2 c  Chopped scallinos,white only
    1/4 c  Olive or other oil
      1    Lemon (juice only)
      3 c  Water
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper
      2 tb Finely chopped dill
      3 ts Cornflour
           Cold water
      2    Eggs
           Chopped dill for garnish
 
  Serves: 4 as a light meal, 8 as a first course Cooking time: 45-50
  minutes
  
  Wash artichokes well and cut off stem close to base. Have ready a
  bowl of cold water with the juice of 1 lemon and some lemon slices
  added. If desired stir in 2-3 tablespoons flour as this is quite
  effective in preventing discoloration.
  
  As each artichoke is prepared, rub cut surfaces with a lemon slice
  from the bowl and place in bowl until all are prepared. Cook as soon
  as possible after preparation.
  
  Remove 3 or 4 layers of leaves until the tender inner leaves remain.
  Scoop out choke and pink thorny leaves from centre, using a spoon or
  melon ball scoop.  Cut in half.
  
  In a large pan gently fry spring onion in oil until soft. Add juice
  of 1/2 lemon, water, about 2 teaspoons salt and a good grinding of
  pepper. Bring to the boil.
  
  Drain prepared artichokes and add to pan with dill. Return to a slow
  simmer, cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes or until artichokes are
  tender.  Stain cooking liquid into a pan and boil until reduced to
  half original quantity (about 1-1/2 cups).  Keep artichokes hot in a
  slow oven.
  
  Mix cornflour to a paste with a little cold water and stir into
  simmering liquid.  Stir until thickened and bubbling and leave to
  simmer gently.
  
  Beat eggs in a mixing bowl until light and frothy and gradually add
  remaining lemon juice.  Gradually pour in simmering stock, beating
  constantly.  Return to pan and stir over low heat for a minute or 2
  to cook the egg.
  
  Pile artichokes on a warm platter, pour sauce on top and sprinkle with
  chopped dill.  Serve as a light meal or as a first course.

      Title: ANGINARES TARAMA
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 sm Fresh globe artichokes
  1 1/2 oz Tarama; rinsed if necessary
           -=OR=-
      2 oz -Smoked skinned cod's roe
      1 tb Finely grated onion pulp
      2 lg Juicy lemons
      1 c  Fruity olive oil
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper
 
  To clean the artichokes, cut off the stems flush with the base,
  remove any tough, unsightly outer leaves and cut off the top
  one-third of the flower bud itself. Force the leaves open a little,
  and rinse under cold water, with a squeeze of lemon or a splash of
  vinegar to prevent discoloring.
  
  Place the artichokes upside-down in a pot large enough to hold them
  all in one layer and pour in boiling water to come one-fourth of the
  way up the sides. Salt and simmer 15-40 minutes, depending on their
  age and size - until the heart is just tender when pricked with a
  fork. Drain and refresh them under cold water; drain again and chill.
  
  Beat the tarama or smoked cod's roe with the grated onion. You can do
  this easily in a food processor. Finely grate the zest of one lemon
  and beat in, with 2 teaspoons boiling water.
  
  Squeeze the juice of both lemons.  Alternately dribble in lemon juice
  and olive oil, beating each addition in before adding the next, as
  though making mayonnaise - it may not need all the oil. If you are
  doing this by hand, it take perseverence and elbow grease to make it
  nice and light. Taste and season with pepper.  Open the artichokes
  and remove the inner, soft leaves and then the hairy choke. Spoon
  tarama into the cup of leaves.

 Categories: Barry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 pt Milk
  1 1/2 lb Leeks
      8    Free Range Eggs, Size 2
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Heaped, Cornflour
      1 oz Butter
        pn Nutmeg
      2 oz Grated Caerphilly Cheese
           -or cheddar
 
  Trim the leeks and wash them thoroughly. Cut into 1 inch lengths. Put
  the milk ( or milk / cream mixture) into a non-stick saucepan with
  the leeks and bring to the boil. If you like your leeks soft rather
  than slightly crisp, let them boil for a minute or two. Remove the
  leeks (leaving the milk in the pan) and put them into a baking dish.
  Put the eggs cold into boiling water and cook for exactly five
  minutes. Remove, cool and shell. The eggs should be soft in the
  middle but the whites will be firm. Lay the shelled eggs on the
  leeks. Make a white sauce by whisking in the cornflour, salt and
  butter and bring gently to the boil while you whisk. When the sauce
  is smooth, thick and glossy, pour it over the eggs and leeks,
  sprinkle the top with nutmeg and grated cheese and put it under the
  grill until it is hot and bubbling. Don't leave it too long or the
  eggs will be over-cooked. Serve at once with lots of crusty bread and
  butter

      Title: ANGU (CORNMEAL MUSH)
 Categories: Cereal, Brazalian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:
      1 tb Oil
      2    Clove garlic, minced (2 tsp)
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped (about
           -1/4 cup)
      2 c  Cold water (to 3 cups)
           Salt & fresh ground black
           -pepper
    1/2 c  Fine (stone ground) cornmeal
 
  Servings: 6 to 8 Notes: Angu (pronounced "aing goo") is a sort of
  polenta, one of the many cooked starch pastes one finds in Brazil.
  For best results, use a fine, stone ground cornmeal.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Cook the garlic and
  onion over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not
  brown. Add 2 cups water and bring to a rapid boil.
  
  Add the cornmeal in a thin stream through your fingers, stirring
  vigorously to prevent lumps. The mixture should be the consistency of
  choux pastry or soft ice cream. If too thick, make a hole in the angu
  with a wooden spoon and stir in a little cold water. Reduce the heat
  to low and gently simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Correct the seasoning
  and serve at once.
  
  Note: For a prettier presentation, the angu can be spooned into a
  thickly buttered tube pan and unmolded onto a platter. (Picture in
  magazine shows that a fluted tube pan was used, and the center of the
  unmolded angu was filled with flat leaf parsley- or cilantro?

      Title: ANISE & WALNUT BISCOTTI
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 48 Biscotti
 
  1 2/3 c  Bread flour
      2 c  Cake flour
      2 c  Walnut pieces
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 tb Anise seeds
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
      3    Eggs
  1 1/3 c  White sugar
      2 ts Lemon zest
      2 ts Orange zest
    1/2 ts Anise extract
      8 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
           Chocolate, optional
 
  Blend bread and cake flours, walnuts, baking powder, baking soda and
  anise seeds in bowl. Melt butter and set aside to cool.
  
  Beat 2 eggs, 1 additional egg yolk and sugar until smooth. Reserve the
  remaining egg white. Stir in zests and anise. Add butteer and mix
  until smooth. Add dry ingredients and mix to smooth dough.
  
  Roll dough into 2 14inch logs and place on baking sheet lined with
  parchment paper. Press tops of logs to flatten slightly. Brush with
  reserved egg white.
  
  Bake at 375 degrees F. until logs are light brown, but still give
  slightly when tops are pressed, about 30 minutes. Remove pan from
  oven and reduce temperature to 325 degrees.
  
  While logs are still warm, cut diagonally into 1/2 inch slices. Return
  slices to baking sheet, placing on sides. Return to oven and bake
  until cookies are lightly brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven
  and cool on wire racks.
  
  Cut chocolate into 1/2 inch chunks. Place 2/3 in stainless steel bowl,
  spreading in even layer over bottom and up sides of bowl. Cover bowl
  with plastic wrap. Fill medium saucepan 1/3 full of water. Bring
  water to simmer over high heat. Remove pan from heat and set bowl of
  chocolate over top. Let stand until 80% of the chocolate has melted.
  
  Do not let temperature of chocolate drop below 88 degrees on candy
  thermometer. If so, place bowl over saucepan of warm water and
  continue stirring. Stir until chocolate is smooth and glossy.
  
  Have clean sheet of waxed paper nearby. Dip 1/2 of each cookie in
  chocolate. As cookie is removed, scrape top and bottom against side
  of bowl to remove excess chocolate. Set cookies on waxed paper until
  chocolate sets, about 3 hours or put into freezer for about 20
  minutes. Submitted By SANDY GAMBLE <SCG@INDIRECT.COM> On FRI, 17 NOV

      Title: ANISE - FENNEL
 Categories: Spices
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lg Stalks anise (fennel)
      1    Clove garlic, quartered
      2 tb Olive oil
      3 tb Butter
      1 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
      1 c  Chopped fresh tomatoes
    1/3 c  Beef stock or bouillon
    1/2 ts Sweet basil
 
  There is a bit of confusion about these two plants. For some
  reason,the fennel plant, which resembles celery with fern like tops,
  has been called sweet anise in produce markets. The true anise is
  cultivated only for its seeds. So what you see labelled "sweet anise"
  in your market is probably fennel, but no matter what you call it,
  this is a highly interesting vegetable.  Every part of this aromatic
  plant has a taste and aroma similar to licorice. The stems are eaten
  like celery,uncook, or cooked and served as a vegetable (heavenly
  with apples in waldorf salad) Available from September to May.
  
  HOW TO CHOOSE AND STORE:  Choose fennel the same way you do celery,
  with crisp stalks and fresh leaves. Wash and store in vegetable
  crisper or plastic bag in refrigerator.
  
  BASIC PREPARATION: Trim the ferny tops and remove tough outer stalks.
  Cut off heavy base.  Slice the stalks in thin lengthwise strips.
  Wash,drain and cook in boiling, salted water or bouillon until just
  tender,15-20 minutes. Drain and add melted butter, salt and pepper
  and serve.

 Categories: Digest, August, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  + 2 Tbps flour
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Anise seeds, crushed
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      3    Egg equivalents (comercial
           Replacer, 6 whites, etc)
      2 tb Grated fresh lemon zest (or
      1 tb Dry)
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Coat baking sheet with non-stick
  spray or parchment.  In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, anise
  seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together egg
  equivalents, lemon zest, and lemon juice, and add to the dry
  ingredients. Mix well. Working on a floured surface, shape dough into
  two logs, each about 14 inches long and 1-1/2 inches thick.  Set the
  logs on prepared baking sheet, at least 4 inches apart (the dough
  will spread during baking). Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until firm to
  the touch. Transfer the logs to the rack to cool. Reduce oven
  temperature to 300 degrees F. Cut the logs diagonally into
  1/2-inch-thick slices, using a serrated knife and a gentle sawing
  motion. Stand the slices on their sides on the baking sheet and
  return to the oven. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool
  completely before storing. Biscotti will crisp as they cool.  Store,
  in an air-tight container, up to one month. Makes about 4 dozen
  biscotti.

  sheets about 1/2 inch apart. Swirl each to make a circular form. You
  can bake these two ways. Either let stand on baking sheets for 8
  hours at room temperature ( to dry out ) or bake immediately. Either
  way bake at 325 degrees about 10 minutes or until firm looking or
  set. cool on rack and store airtight. If made the first way to dry
  out these are a coffee dunker cookie or if baked immediately they are
  much softer and delicate.Either way they are delicious. I bake mine

    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 lg Lemon

  Thoroughly stir together flour, anise, baking powder, and slat and set
  aside.  Using a small sharp knife peel a thin layer of zest (without
  white membrane) from the entire lemon. Combine lemon zest and sugar
  in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Process until zest is
  very finely minced.  Add shortening and butter to the processor and
  process for one minute.  Add egg yolk and vanilla and process 20
  seconds longer. Add dry ingredients and continue processing just

  minutes, or until the dough is chilled and slightly firm. Preheat
  oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease several baking sheets. Work one
  half of the dough at at time. Turn the dough over and peel the sheet
  of wax paper off of the dough and replace the paper loosely. Then
  turn the dough right side up.  Peel off and discard the top sheet of
  paper. Using assorted 2 1/4 to 3" cookie cutters cut out cookies.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
      3    Egg whites
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
    1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Ground anise seeds
 
  The flavor of anise in these light cookies makes them a great after-
  dinner dessert. Some people prefer the center to be soft and chewy,
  but if you prefer the dry melt-in-your-mouth type of meringue, turn
  off the oven and, with the door closed, let them stand 30 minutes to
  an hour. These cookies are generally baked on parchment paper, but we
  have found that regular bond paper makes a very acceptable
  substitute. (By Times Food Stylists) Beat egg whites until frothy.
  Add cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Gradually beat in sugar.
  Continue beating until stiff and glossy. Beat in anise. Using pastry
  bag, pipe onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake at 275 degrees F.
  30 minutes. Makes about 4 dozen kisses. NOTE: If drier meringue is
  desired, turn off oven and let kisses stand in oven with door closed
  about 1 hour. Each kiss contains about: 9 calories; 4 mg sodium; 0
  cholesterol; 0 fat; 2 grams carbohydrates; 0 protein; trace fiber.

      2 lb Beef brisket, trimmed of
           -excess fat
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1    Onion, finely chopped
      1 tb Minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Minced garlic
    1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
      6    Star anise
      3 tb Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Dry sherry
      2 c  Beef broth
      3 tb Dark molasses
           Salt and pepper, to taste
      8    Dried black fungus (tree
           -ears)
      1    Tomato, finely chopped
      4    Scallions, sliced
      1 ts Asian sesame oil
 
  Here, beef brisket takes on an Asian flare.  Slices of meat are
  braised in an aromatic stock seasoned with star anise, soy sauce,
  ginger, garlic, red pepper and dark molasses. As a final step, pureed
  eggplant is stirred in, for flavor and thickening.
  
  Pierce the eggplant several times with the tines of a fork. Place in a
  preheated 400F oven and roast for 3 minutes, or until shriveled and
  soft. Set aside. Slice the brisket against the grain into 1/4-inch
  thick slices.
  
  Heat the oil in a large wok or large deep skillet. When it begins to
  smoke, add half of the beef and cook, stirring, until browned. Remove
  and set aside.
  
  Add remaining beef, and cook, stirring until browned. Remove and set
  aside. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, crushed pepper, star anise and
  soy sauce to wok and stir-fry for 10 seconds.
  
  Return beef to wok, along with the sherry, broth and molasses. Stir to
  blend and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over low beat
  for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the beef is tender.
  
  While beef is cooking, soak fungus in hot water to cover. When
  swelled and softened, drain and rinse well; set aside.
  
  Cut the stem end from the cooked eggplant.  Split in half lengthwise
  and scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender. Puree.
  
  Add eggplant, drained fungus and tomatoes to beef and cook for 5
  minutes longer.  Stir in scallions and drizzle with sesame oil. Serve
  with rice, if desired.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: ANISE-ALMOND BISCOTTI
 Categories: Cookies and, New imports
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Whole almonds
  2 1/4 c  Flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Butter -- softened
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2    Eggs -- lightly beaten
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 tb Anise seeds
 
  To toast almonds, preheat oven to 350=B0F. Spread almonds in a single
  layer on a baking sheet and toast, turning occasionally, for 10
  minutes. Set aside to cool, then roughly chop. Sift together flour,
  baking powder and salt in a small mixing bowl. Set aside. Cream
  butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large mixing bowl until
  fluffy; then beat in eggs and vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture,
  mix until combined, then stir in chopped almonds and anise seeds.
  Dough will be stiff. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work
  surface, then, using your hands or a rolling pin, shape into one long
  roll, about 3 inches by 13 inches. Line baking sheet with parchment
  paper or aluminum foil (shiny side up). Transfer dough roll to baking
  sheet, flatten slightly, then bake until golden brown, about 35
  minutes. Remove from oven--do not turn oven off--and set aside until
  cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Using a serrated knife, cut
  roll, on the diagonal, into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place slices flat
  on baking sheet and bake, turning once, until golden brown, about 5
  minutes per side. Do not over bake: Biscotti will feel soft in the
  middle but will become crisp and hard as they cool. Allow to cool
  completely on pan. Biscotti will keep in a sealed container for up to
  4 weeks. Makes about 2 dozen

      Title: ANNA JACHIMOWICZ'S STANDARD SEASONING
 Categories: Vegetarian, Spices, Vegetables, Ethnic, Polish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           -Cookie Lady
 
   One standard seasoning Mrs. Jachimowicz uses is fried onions. She
  usually makes a large quantity at once so she can add it to each dish
  without preparing it each time. After finely chopping the onions, she
  browns them with a little flour in vegetable oil. When they are
  golden, she melts some butter in the pan. The oil prevents the onions
  from burning and the butter is added for flavor. She also seasons
  most of her foods with seasoned salt, celery salt or savory.

 Categories: Low fat, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 oz Pudding rice
      2 oz Sugar
      1 pt Skimmed milk - that's an
           Imperial pint; 2 1/2 US
           Cups
 
  Bring the milk to the boil, then pour over the rice and sugar. Then
  EITHER bake in a very low oven for about 2 hours, or, which I prefer,
  stir on a low heat on the top of the stove until the rice is cooked.
  This will not thicken all that much until it is cold, but when cold
  it is deliciously creamy.

      1    Egg; lightly beaten, at room
           -temperature
    1/2 c  Butter; softened
    1/2 c  Milk

MMMMM-------------------------TOP LAYER------------------------------
      4 oz White chocolate; 4 squares
      1 tb Butter
      2 oz Semisweet chocolate;2 sq-opt
 
  Preheat oven to 350F. FIRST LAYER: Grease 8 inch square cake pan with
  butter. Mix together thoroughly flour, confectioner's sugar (icing
  sugar), softened butter and coffee dissolved in hot water. (You can
  use food processor or electric mixer). Press mixture evenly into pan
  bottom. Bake 10 minutes in preheated 350F oven. Cool on wire rack.
  SECOND LAYER: Meanwhile in large bowl, combine confectioner's sugar
  (icing sugar), 1 Tbsp coffee crystals dissolved in 2 Tbsp hot water,
  softened butter and 1 egg (lightly beaten with a fork at room
  temperature.) Mix until thoroughly combined. (can use food processor
  or electric mixer). Put milk in pot over medium heat and scald (heat
  until bubbles appear around sides but milk is not a rolling boil).
  Add mixture from bowl and heat 7 minutes over medium heat , stirring
  frequently at first, constantly after the mixture bubbles. (If
  mixture starts to stick on bottom, lower heat slightly). Let cool
  slightly, then pour over first layer. Tilt pan to cover base layer
  evenly. Chill in refrigerator half an hour or more till set. THIRD
  LAYER: Combine 4 oz white chocolate with 1 Tbsp butter in double
  boiler and melt (or melt 1 -1 1/2 minutes in microwave on High and
  stir ). Spread over chilled second layer with spatula or blunt knife
  (layer will be quite thin). OPTIONAL MARBLED EFFECT: Melt 2 oz
  semisweet chocolate in double boiler (or in microwave 1 - 1 1/2
  minutes on High and stir). Pour melted semisweet chocolate into small
  ziploc bag and seal. Snip corner of bag with scissors. Squeeze out
  horizontal lines of semisweet chocolate onto white chocolate layer.
  With a blunt knife, swirl the two chocolates together to create a
  marbled effect. Chill. Before the third layer is completely set,
  score into bars. VARIATION: Mocha Squares: substitute semisweet
  chocolate for white chocolate (this variation is easier as the middle
  layer and semisweet chocolate are similar in colour.) MAKES: approx
  32 bars (they are very sweet, therefore the bars should be small)

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      1 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Shortening
    1/2 c  Sugar
      4 lg Egg yolks
    1/3 c  Milk
      2 ts Vanilla extract

MMMMM----------------------WALNUT MERINGUE---------------------------
      5 lg Egg whites
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Chopped walnuts

MMMMM------------------VANILLA CUSTARD FILLING-----------------------
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Cornstarch
      1 pn Salt
      1 lg Egg yolk
      1 c  Milk
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F with rack in center of oven. Generously grease 2
  8-inch layer cake pans. Dust with flour, tapping pans over sink to
  remove excess flour. FOR CAKE, sift flour, baking powder and salt
  together onto waxed paper; set aside. Use mixer to cream shortening
  and sugar until fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well
  after each addition. Add vanilla. Combine well. Add reserved flour
  mixture alternately with milk, mixing until smooth. Divide batter
  between prepared pans. Use back of spoon to spread batter evenly;
  this takes a little patience. FOR MERINGUE, beat egg whites until
  they are thick and hold their shape but are still soft and moist. Add
  sugar by the tablespoon, beating well after each addition. Divide
  between pans. Use spatula to spread over batter. Sprinkle with nuts,
  dividing evenly. Bake until lightly colored and toothpick inserted
  into center comes out clean (it's OK if meringue cracks), about 30
  minutes. Let rest 10 minutes in pans on cooling racks. Use flexible
  knife to release cake from sides of pan. Gently invert cakes. Set
  them meringue-side up to cool completely. Spread one meringue layer
  with filling. Top with other layer, meringue-side up. It's best
  served the day it is made but it can be made a day ahead and kept
  cool (but not refrigerated). If made ahead, keep covered. Yield: 1
  8-inch layer cake. VANILLA CUSTARD FILLING: Combine sugar, cornstarch
  and salt in heavy 1-quart saucepan. Stir in egg yolk and milk. Stir
  over medium heat. Stir until mixture coats spoon, about 4 minutes.
  Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Let cool completely. If mixture
  becomes lumpy, whisk vigorously, before using.

  [I made these last night to pack for my trip to Reno. Whatever you do,
  don't use creamy peanut butter!  With just 1/2 cup nut butter mixed
  with 2 cups flour, the nut taste gets kind of lost. I used almond
  butter; we also used Cantbelieveitsnotbutter for the margarine. Don't
  round those Tbspfulls too high, as these cookies wind up a bit on the
  large size. I also forgot about flattening them out; oh well... What
  I have are chocolate chip cookies (mini-chips), with a faint almond
  flavor.]

  * - cut each into 8 pieces, backbone removed (save liver and gizzard
  for another use).
  
  1. Wash each piece of chicken under cold running water. Pat dry with
  paper toweling.
  
  2. Place flour, salt, mustard, and pepper in a large paper bag. Twist
  closed and shake to blend ingredients. Drop the chicken pieces into
  the bag a few at a time and shake the bag vigorously until each piece
  is thoroughly coated. Remove the chicken pieces from the bag and
  shake off excess flour - there will be plenty of it. Then lay them
  side by side on waxed paper and place them near the stove so that you
  can get to them easily when you start frying.
  
  3. Preheat oven to warm and in it place a large baking dish lined with
  paper toweling.
  
  4. Heat the lard in a heavy 10-12" skillet. The fat should fill the
  pan to a depth of about 2 inches. Add more lard if necessary.
  
  5. Place over moderate heat and when the fat is hot but not smoking,
  begin frying chicken. Put in the thigh and legs first and cover the
  pan at once. Let the chicken fry over moderate heat, lifting the
  cover occasionally to check the process, and when deep brown turn -
  with a wooden spoon, so you don't pierce the skin. Cover and brown
  the other side. As each piece is cooked, remove it, place it in the
  warm oven, and put an uncooked piece in its place.
  
  6. Cook all of the chicken in the same way. Just remember that the
  white meat will take a little less time to cook than the dark pieces.
  
  7. Leave the chicken in the oven while preparing the gravy.

     10    Or more cloves garlic,
           Chopped
      2    To 4 green peppers, chopped
      1    Or more hot peppers of your
           Choice (jalepeno,
           Serrano, ..), minced
      2    To 4 15 oz cans crushed
           Tomatoes
      6    To 12 oz tomato paste
    1/2    To 1 lb mushrooms, coursly

      1 tb Cumin
 
  Saute the onion, peppers, hot peppers, and garlic until the onions are
  translucent.  Add all other ingrediants and simmer a minimum of 30
  minutes (about how long corn bread takes to cook ;-). Add water if
  chili is too thick.  Adjust seasonings during cooking to taste.
  
  That's it!  Last night's batch had TVP, 1 can pinto beans, 2 cans
  kidney beans, 1 can black eye peas, so I used double the spices and
  the higher amounts of the rest of the ingrediants. Very tasty last
  night and of course even better today for lunch.

      Title: ANOTHER DEEP FRIED ICE CREAM
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Box of unsweetened
           -cornflakes, crunched to
           -dust (or as near as you
           -can
           -get!)
 
  1/4 to 1/2 cup sugar
  
        2 tb ground cinnamon
  
        4    eggs, well beaten
  
  Ice cream
  
  Ok, the night before you want to make this (or in the morning...),
  take the ice cream and scoop it into balls (tennis ball size). Make
  sure the balls of ice cream are solid, no air pockets. You will
  likely have to use your hands.  Place them in a shallow pan that you
  can put into the freezer (lined with wax paper). Freeze overnight, or
  at least 6 hours.
  
  Next, combine the crushed cornflakes, sugar and cinnamon in a large
  (gallon size) ziplock bag.  Put the beaten eggs into a bowl.
  
  Take the ice cream balls and coat them with the cornflake mixture,
  really pressing it into the surface of the ball. Then, dip the whole
  thing into the egg mixture and re-coat it with cornflakes. Return to
  the freezer for at least 2 hours.  Make sure there are no "bald
  spots" anywhere on the ice cream ball.  You might need to dip into
  the egg and re-coat with the cornflakes one more time.  Freeze for at
  LEAST 2 hours before you are going to fry.
  
  Use a good deep fryer, and heat it to a fairly high temperature (I
  don't know exactly how hot this is, I never measured....).
  Immediately before you want to serve, remove one ice cream ball from
  the freezer at a time, and drop into the hot oil (use canola....) for
  about 30 seconds, or until it just begins to brown. Take it out of
  the oil and put in a bowl to serve. Top with really good stuff like
  hot fudge (lots....really lots...oh, sorry, I'm thinking about this
  too much), whipped cream, nuts, anything else that you might deem
  appropriate.
  
  The shell should be cooked and crunchy, and the inside will still be
  frozen (amazing, isn't it?).  You can only cook one at a time, so if
  you have a whole bunch to make, use more than one fryer. Let the oil
  return to the high temperature before you add the next ball.

      Title: ANOTHER GYROS
 Categories: Lamb, Greek
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Lean ground lamb
      2 sl Homemade bread, toasted and
           -crumbled
      1 ts Allspice, crushed
      1 ts Coriander seed, crushed
      1    Clove garlic, pressed
      1    Onion, grated
      1 ts Fresh savory, chopped
           Salt, to taste
           Freshly ground pepper, to
           -taste
           Bacon slices (optional)
 
  In large bowl, combined all ingredients.  Mix well, kneading until
  mixture is stiff.  Make fingers of meat (about 5-inches longer and
  not over 2-inches in diameter). Place fingers on skewer spacing about
  1-inch apart. Cook over hot coals for 10 to 15 minutes, turning
  frequently until cooked through.
  
  You may wrap the "fingers" on the skewer with sliced bacon. If anyone
  tries this, let me know how it works out.
  
  NOTE:  I have this frequently in Greece and here in the U.S., but as
  I have said, I view it as a "deli" item. Krinos Foods has a "gyros
  kit" that is sold in the frozen food section of some supermarkets.

        1 T  lemon juice 2-4 garlic cloves, minced or crushed 1 Pn
  pinch of coriander 4 - 6 drops of toasted sesame oil*
  
  * (optional, negligible fat, adds flavor)  Must be TOASTED SESAME OIL
  (I found in Asian food section of HFS.Very strong flavor, a bottle
  should last for years)
  
  Mash garbanzos (I mash with a potato masher, then run in batches in
  blender, because I like my hummus smooth) Mix in everything else,
  tasting as you go along. Salt can be added, if you like. I also add
  some red pepper on the top before serving. Chilling seems to mix the
  flavors. Serve with pita wedges.
  
  With the sesame oil you really get the taste without all the fat. Play
  around with it.  I have never tasted hummus that was the same, it all
  varies depending on who makes it! Oh yes, cucumber goes well with
  this (on top of pita wedge).

      Title: ANOTHER IRISH SODA BREAD RECIPE <T>
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 lb Raisins
      3 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ea Caraway seeds to taste
           (usually 1/8 cup
      1 qt Buttermilk
 
  Mix all the dry ingredients in a LARGE bowl. Mix in caraway and
  rasins. Mix in buttermilk. It helps to use your hands to mix this
  because the dough is stickey DO NOT USE AN ELECTRIC MIXER. I did this
  a couple of times and the bread came out very flat. Divide batter
  into two buttered cake pans. Flour a knife and cut a cross into the
  tops of each. Bake at 350 for about an hour. The top should not be
  allowed to get to brown.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Dry brown lentils, rinsed
      1    Bay leaf
      1 c  Uncooked fine bulgur wheat
      1 c  Soft whole-wheat bread
           Crumbs
      1    Egg substitute, beaten

      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      1 ts Dried thyme
      2 ts Dried oregano
      1 ts Dried tarragon
        x  Salt and pepper to taste
      3 tb Tomato paste or tomato
           Sauce
 
  Prep:  Cook lentils and bay leaf in pot with 6 cups water. Bring to a
  boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until lentils are soft and water
  has been absorbed, about 45 min.
  
  Combine bulgur and 2 cups water in  a med. saucepan. Bring to a boil,
  reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 15 min.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Transfer lentils to a large mixing bowl. Add
  bulgur, and remaining ingredients except tomato paste or sauce. Mix
  well with your hands until thoroughly combined.  Pat mixture into a
  9" loaf pan. Bake for 40 min. until firm but not dry. During last
  minutes of baking, brush top with tomato paste or sauce. Let cool for
  15 min. Cut into slices and serve warm.
  
  This goes wonderfully with mashed potatoes and your favorite
  vegetable! The leftovers taste so good in a pita pocket, and if there
  are mashed potatoes leftover, I stuff the pocket with both.   Mmmm!
  Enjoy!

      Title: ANTEBELLUM RICE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Melted butter
    1/2 tb Melted shortening
      1 c  Cooked rice
    1/2 c  Cornmeal
      1 ts Salt *
      1 ds Cayenne pepper (optional)
      1 c  Milk
      3    Eggs, beaten
 
  This one is from The Bread Winners Cookbook by Mel London.
  
  This recipe was given to me by an old friend in Savannah, who told me
  that it was a favorite breakfast bread on the plantations.
  
  * The salt, though traditional, may be eliminated if you choose to do
  so.
  
  Place the melted fats and the rice in a heavy saucepan, covered, over
  very low heat.  Mix cornmeal and salt and pepper, then stir milk into
  beaten eggs and blend in the cornmeal. Blend together with the rice
  mixture and put into greased 8- or 9-inch square pan.
  
  Bake at 450 deg.F. until firm when tapped with finger and well
  browned on top--about 25 minutes.
  
  Cut into squares to serve.
  
  Makes 1 to 1 1/2 dozen squares.
  
  NOTE:  This just looked like an interesting combination... and like
  something that would create a little more (or different) texture.. a
  fun bread.  It almost sounds like it might come out a custardy
  bread...

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Squid (opt, but highly
           -recommended)
           White wine
     24    Mussels, fresh in-shell; or
     24    Oysters, fresh in-shell
     16    Crab claws, cooked
      1 lb Lobster meat, freshly cooked
     16    Prawns; cooked, peeled
      1 lb Shrimp, med; cooked, peeled
    1/2 lb Shrimp, popcorn; cooked
     16    Lemon wedges
    3/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
      1 cn Mushrooms packed in oil
      1 c  Mayonnaise
    1/3 c  Catsup
           Brandy; to taste
           Worcestershire; to taste
 
  Have your fish dealer prepare the squid (skin, remove the long bone
  on the inside, the yellow deposit, and the ink sac). Wash the squid
  well, dry thoroughly, and cut crosswise into 1/4" slices resembling
  rings. Poach in white wine to cover just until tender. Drain. Cool to
  room temperature.
  
  Thoroughly wash and scrub the mussels, removing grit and sand. Place
  the mussels in a large pot. Pour in 1/2 cup boiling water, cover and
  steam over medium heat for 5 minutes or until the shells open. They
  should be cooked and served the same day you buy them.
  
  Arrange an assortment of the seafood attractively on 8 plates.
  Garnish with lemon wedges. Whisk together the oil and lemon juice,
  and drizzle the mixture over the seafood. Using a whisk, combine the
  mayonnaise, catsup, brandy, and Worchestershire sauce. Serve a dollop
  of this sauce on each plate.
  
  Venetian cooking allows the delicate flavor of the seafood full rein.
  This antipasto is actually a filling first course.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Iceberg lettuce
      1 cn (Large) Italian tuna,*
      1    Small jar roasted red -
      1    Small jar green vinegar -
           Peppers,**
           Peppers
           Tomatoes, cut in wedges
           Pitted black olives
           Green olives w/Pimento
           Provolone cheese,***
           Imported ham****
           Genoa Salami****
           Mortadella****
           Pepperoni (large slices)****
 
  *packed in olive oil
  **packed in vinegar and oil
  ***sliced, slices cut in half
  ****Sliced Italian cold cuts, rolled lengthwise
  On platter, arrange lettuce, leaving a hole in the middle large
  enough to hold the can of tuna. Drain oil from the can over the
  lettuce, then place tuna in the middle of platter.
  Divide platter into sections, placing 1/2 slice of cheese in each
  section. On top of cheese, place 1 rolled slice of each type of meat.
  Drain liquid from red pepper jar over all, then randomly place
  peppers, olives, and tomatoes around the platter. Salt and pepper to
  taste, then pour more olive oil over all.
  Eat heartily, accompanied by much loud Italian conversation. In fact,
  I typed this accompanied by much loud Italian conversation. My
  parents were here, and both were shouting instructions over my
  shoulder. They disagreed about the arrangement of the lettuce - my
  mother said that the hole in the middle of the platter was necessary;
  my father insisted that it wasn't, saying you can just dump the tuna
  on top of the lettuce. I finally had to give up on this reply until
  they went home. So now, in the peace and quiet of the aftermath, I've
  finished it. Hope you had a wonderful holiday.

  I had some modifications: I omitted the celery (Yuck!) I omitted the
  pepperoncini peppers (Yuck!) I doubled the artichoke hearts (Yum!!) I
  used large mushrooms sliced, since there weren't small ones at the
  store I had no Italian seasoning, so I used about a tablespoon of
  oregano and a tablespoon of basil, and it worked out fine. I
  increased the olive oil by about a teaspoon.
  
  You could use a light cheese tortellini or a different type of
  tortellini, or even bow-tie pasta or something, to lessen the fat
  content. This tasted the best after it had marinated for about 2 days.

      Title: ANTOINE'S CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
     20 md Mushrooms; sliced
    1/4 c  Sherry
      3 c  Chicken stock
      2 c  Heavy cream
    3/4 c  Sherry

           Chicken-Hazelnut Quenelles
      2 tb Hazelnuts; skins removed,
           - and chopped
 
  To roast the hazelnuts you should place them on a sheet pan and put
  them in a 400F oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the outside skin
  starts to break away.  Rub the hazelnuts together so that the outer
  dark skins flake off. You do not want to toast them, you just want
  the skin to loosen up.
  
  In a large skillet place the butter and heat it on medium high until
  it has melted.  Add the mushrooms and saut them for 4 to 5 minutes,
  or until they are brown. Add the 1/4 cup of sherry and deglaze the
  pan. Add the chicken stock.  Cook the ingredients on medium heat for
  12 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced by 1/2.
  
  In a small saucepan place the 3/4 cup of sherry.  Cook it on medium
  high heat for 4 to 6 minutes, or until it is reduced by 3/4.
  
  Add the reduced sherry, salt, and pepper to soup, and stir them in.
  
  In each of 4 individual serving bowls place 3 of the Chicken-Hazelnut
  Quenelles.  Ladle the soup on top. Sprinkle on the hazelnuts.

      Title: ANTS CLIMBING UP A TREE
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Pork shoulder steak, boned
           -and finely chopped, not
           -ground
      2 tb Soy sauce, light
      2 tb Chinese rice wine or dry
           -sherry
      1 ts Ginger; grated
      6    Scallions; thinly sliced
      1 c  Finely chopped cabbage or
           -Napa (celery cabbage)
      1 oz Chinese dried mushrooms,
           -soaked in water for 2
           -hours,
           Drained and finely chopped
           -(reserve the water)
      4 c  Oil, peanut; for deep frying
      1    Package (4 ounce) glass
           -noodles (sai fun)
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped
      1 tb Hot bean sauce
        pn Sugar, granulated
           Pepper, black; to taste
      2 tb Cornstarch dissolved in 2
           -tablespoons water
      1 tb Oil, sesame, toasted
 
  Iceberg lettuce leaves, 2 or 3 for each person Bone and finely chop
  the pork. Do not grind this as you want very small pieces to "climb"
  on the branches of the noodles. Marinate the pork in the soy, wine
  and ginger for about 15 minutes. Slice the green onions. Finely chop
  the cabbage and mushrooms, reserving the soaking water from the
  mushrooms. Heat the oil in a wok until it is just beginning to smoke.
  Use good ventilation in your kitchen for this one! Open the noodle
  package and undo them a bit. Drop into the hot fat in small batches.
  They will immediately puff up into wonderful white crunchy noodles.
  Turn quickly to be sure that all of them are cooked. Remove from the
  pan and drain on paper towels. Be very careful with this. You could
  burn yourself. Set the noodles aside. Heat another wok or frying pan
  and add 1 Tablespoon of the peanut oil. Add the chopped garlic and
  toss for a moment. Add the meat and marinade and stir fry, mixing it
  about, until the meat is tender but not dry, about 3 minutes on high
  heat. Remove the meat mixture and add the vegetables to the wok. Stir
  fry over high heat for 3 more minutes. Return the meat to the pan and
  add the hot bean sauce, sugar and black pepper. Stir fry for 1 minute
  and then add the cornstarch dissolved in the water. Stir until the
  sauce thickens. If you have too little sauce, add a bit of the water
  in which you have soaked the mushrooms. Add the sesame oil and stir.
  Place the fried noodles on a large platter and pour the meat and
  vegetable mixture over the noodles. Do this carefully so that the
  little pieces of pork and mushrooms will cling to the "branches".
  Toss at the table in front of your guests. Each person then takes a
  bit of noodle and meat sauce and places it in the center of a lettuce
  leaf. Roll it up like a burrito and enjoy. Serves 6-8 as part of a
  Chinese meal Source: The Frugal Gourmet Cooks With Wine From The

 Categories: Vegetarian, Grains
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    2/3 c  TVP
    1/2 c  Hot water
      1 tb Chopped or grated ginger
           Root
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1    To 2 Tbsp hot bean paste
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
  3 1/2 oz Bean thread noodles
      2 c  Veggie broth or water (avoid
           Broth that may have a sweet
           Taste)
 
  Pour the boiling water over the TVP and let it sit for 10 minutes.
  Saute the gingerroot in a very small anount of oil or other liquid.
  Add the soy sauce, bean paste, salt and TVP. Cook very very gently
  and stir frequently as it burns easily. Cook about 5 minutes and set
  aside.
  
  Cook the bean threads in the broth until the broth has been absorbed
  by the noodles. Add the noodles to the TVP mixture and stir until
  blended evenly...ie. all the "ants" are distributed throughout. Enjoy!
  
  Source: This is a dish that was a favorite at our local Chineses
  eatery. I used to make it with ground turkey (before I saw the light)
  and have found that TVP works just as well. It's hot and
  spicy...delicious and just a little different.

  ANZAC day is celebrated in Australia on April 25.  On this day in
  1915, the ANZACs (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landed at
  Gallipoli, and suffered the worst defeat in Australian military
  history. The fallen soldiers of all wars are now commemorated on
  ANZAC day. Another cookbook stated that these cookies were sold to
  raise money to help returned veterans.
  
  In saucepan place butter, treacle, soda, sugar and mix with boiling
  water. Bring slowly to boil, remove and add dry ingredients. Mix
  well. Place spoonfuls about 3 inches apart on well greased cookie
  tray. Bake at 275F about 25 min.

 Categories: Native amer, Stews
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    Red bell peppers
      5    Green anaheim chiles
    1/4 c  Sunflower oil
      1 lb Venison, cut into 1 1/2 inch
           -cubes
      1    Onion, diced
      3    Garlic cloves, finely
           -chopped
      2    Carrots, sliced
      3 c  Cooked Indian hominy
      8 c  Water
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts White pepper
      1 c  Tumbleweed greens,
           -thoroughly cleaned, or
           -curly endive
 
  Roast the peppers, then peel, seed, and cut into long strips.  Roast
  the chiles, then peel, seed, devein and dice.
  
  Heat the oil in a large stew pot over medium-high heat.  When the oil
  is almost smoking, add the venison and cook until the meat is lightly
  browned, 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the onion and garlic and saute 2
  minutes more.
  
  Stir in the carrots, peppers, and chiles and cook 1 minute more.  Add
  the hominy, water, salt, and pepper and bring the mixture ot a boil.
  Reduce the heat to low and let the stew simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring
  occasionally to prevent burning, until the meat is very tender.  Just
  before serving, add the tumbleweed greens, stir 1 minute and spoon
  into bowls. *****
  
  The Apache people lived in many regions throughout southeastern
  Arizona and New Mexico.  The men hunted the animals that roamed the
  mountains, and the women gathered and harvested both wild foods and
  the foods that they cultivated on the land.
  
  This recipe is based on a traditional stew that was taught to me by a
  San Carlos medicine man during one of my visits to his ranch.  When I
  prepare the stew now, I can vividly remember the tapping of his
  traditional water drum and the songs he chanted in his native Apache
  tongue. Through his songs, he asked for all people to walk in harmony
  with Mother Earth and be guided by the spirit of the mountains and
  the spirit of his drum. I still remember the sincerity and yearning
  of his songs.
  
  Depending on what type of produce was available, the ingredients
  added to the venison varied each time the stew was prepared.  This
  recipe includes the basics of the stew, but you can substitute other
  vegetables.

      Title: APFELPFANNKUCHEN (GERMAN APPLE PANCAKES)
 Categories: Fruits, Penndutch, Breakfast, German
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lg Cooking apples (Yellow
           -Delicious, or Granny Smith)
    1/4 c  Butter
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Milk
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Nutmeg, grated
           Confectioners sugar
 
  Preheat oven to 475.  Peel, core and very thinly slice the apples: you
  should have approximately 1-1/2 cups. Melt 3 T sp. of the butter over
  medium low heat in a small fry pan, and saute the apples until they
  are just tender.  Keep apples warm while preparing the batter.
  
  Place a 9 or 10 inch cast-iron skillet in the oven to heat for at
  least 5 minutes--the pan has to be very hot for this to work. When it
  is well heated, add the remaining 2 T sp. of butter to melt and put
  the skillet back in the oven;  the butter should be very hot buy not
  brown when you add the apples and the batter.
  
  Place the flour, milk, vanilla, salt and nutmeg in a blender and whirl
  until smooth.  Remove the skillet from the oven, quickly arrange the
  warm apple slices over the melted butter, and pour the batter evenly
  over all. Bake for 15 min., reduce heat to 375 and bake 10 min
  longer. The pancake will puff and climb up the sides of the pan.
  Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar, then cut in wedges and serve with
  maple syrup.
  
  Note:  If you do not use apples, add 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter to
  the hot skillet.

 Categories: Sweden, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1 lb Canadian bacon
      2 lg Red tart cooking apples;
           -unpeeled, cored & cut into
           -1/2" thick rings
      2 lg Onions; thinly sliced
           Fresh ground pepper
 
  Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet. When foam subsides
  add the bacon. Fry 5 to 10 minutes or until the bacon is lightly
  browned. Remove from skillet and set on paper towels to drain. Fry
  the onion slices for 6 to 8 minutes in the fat remaining in the
  skillet, adding more butter as necessary. When the onions are soft
  and transparent, add the apple rings and cover the pan. Simmer over
  low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, shaking the pan gently at intervals to
  prevent the apples from sticking. When the apple rings are
  sufficiently cooked (they should offer little or no resistence when
  pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer), return the drained
  bacon to the skillet. Cover and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes
  or until the bacon is heated through. Grind fresh black pepper
  liberally over the top and serve directly from the pan as a luncheon
  entre or Sunday night supper.

      3 tb Butter
      1 ts Vanilla extract or
           -cognac vanilla *
 
  * To make cognac vanilla, get a fresh, fresh vanilla bean, cut
  lengthwise and then crosswise exposing the tiny tiny seeds. Put into
  an airtight container and pour on 2.5 oz. cognac or brandy per bean.
  Every 2 or 3 days, shake the bottle. After about 2 or 3 weeks, you'll
  have a new taste sensation in vanilla flavoring.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 F
  
  Melt 3 T of the butter in a heavy saucepan.  Add flour and blend in
  well until smooth.  Slowly add the milk, stirring constantly with a
  whisk, over medium heat; cook until the mixture thickens, about 1
  minute. Add 1/2 C sugar and beat hard.  Add the egg yolks, blending
  them in well. Remove the pan from the heat and add the vanilla, the
  Calvados or brandy. Set aside, but keep it warm.
  
  Melt the reaming butter in a skillet.  Add the apples, sprinkled with
  the remaining sugar and gently saut until tender, about 7 or 8
  minutes.Beat the egg whites with the salt until they hold stiff
  peaks. Fold a small amount into the egg yolk mixture just to lighten
  it up a little, then fold in the rest of the whites. Place half the
  apples in a buttered shallow 1.5 quart baking dish. Cover the apples
  with half the egg mixture. Add the remaining apples and sprinkle with
  the macaroon crumbs. Cover the apples and macaroon with the remaining
  egg mixture, filing the dish almost to the rim.Bake until the top is
  golden brown and the pudding is fairly firm, 25 to 30 minutes.  Serve
  at once with Vanilla Sauce.
  
  VANILLA SAUCE: Combine the sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan and mix
  well. Add the salt, lemon peel and water.  Bring to a boil and cook
  over medium-high heat until the sauce is clear, 5 to 7 minutes.
  Discard the lemon peel and add the butter. Remove the pan from the
  heat and stir in the vanilla. If you want it creamier, add 1 or 2 T
  heavy whipping cream.

  minute. Add 1/2 C sugar and beat hard.  Add the egg yolks, blending
  them in well. Remove the pan from the heat and add the vanilla, the
  Calvados or brandy. Set aside, but keep it warm.
  
  Melt the reaming butter in a skillet.  Add the apples, sprinkled with
  the remaining sugar and gently saut until tender, about 7 or 8
  minutes.Beat the egg whites with the salt until they hold stiff
  peaks. Fold a small amount into the egg yolk mixture just to lighten
  it up a little, then fold in the rest of the whites. Place half the
  apples in a buttered shallow 1.5 quart baking dish. Cover the apples
  with half the egg mixture. Add the remaining apples and sprinkle with
  the macaroon crumbs. Cover the apples and macaroon with the remaining
  egg mixture, filing the dish almost to the rim.Bake until the top is
  golden brown and the pudding is fairly firm, 25 to 30 minutes.  Serve
  at once with Vanilla Sauce.
  
  Vanilla Sauce:
  
  Combine the sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan and mix well. Add the
  salt, lemon peel and water.  Bring to a boil and cook over
  medium-high heat until the sauce is clear, 5 to 7 minutes. Discard
  the lemon peel and add the butter.  Remove the pan from the heat and
  stir in the vanilla. If you want it creamier, add 1 or 2 T heavy
  whipping cream. Submitted By RHOMMEL@GNN.COM (RICHARD HOMMEL) On TUE,

  in 3 ounces of the sugar. Mix the flour, salt and suet together. Add
  just enough cold water to make a soft. but not sticky dough. Do not
  overwork or you will get tough pastry. Roll out two-thirds of the
  pastry and line the buttery, sugary basin. Slice in the peeled and
  cored apples. Sprinkle in the last ounce of sugar. Make a circle for
  a lid with the last of the pastry. Moisten the edges to make a firm
  seal, pinching the two layers of pastry together well. Trim any
  surplus. Cover with a double layer of greaseproof and steam for two

 Categories: Soups

      2 lg Cooking apples
      1 oz Butter
     60 fl Stock
      2 md Onions, peeled and diced
           Salt and milled pepper

           Chopped parsley and
           -browned flaked almonds
           -to garnish
      1 ts Soft brown sugar
 
  In a large saucepan sweat off the diced onion in the butter. Wash,
  trim and dice the celery, add to the onion and continue on a low
  heat. Remove and bruises from the apples and grate them into your
  pan, discarding the core. Cook for a further 10 minutes before adding
  the stock, seasoning and sugar ~ beware too much salt if you are
  using a stock cube. Bring to the boil, then simmer, lid on, for 30
  minutes - don't over cook or the celery flavour becomes jaded and the
  colours dull. Allow to cool a little before liquidising thoroughly.
  Pass through a large mesh sieve to ensure there are no stringy
  threads of celery remaining. Check seasoning and consistency, adding
  a little milk if needed. Serve in warmed bowls, sprinkled with
  parsley and the browned almond flakes.

  Peel and core apples and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Dice fennel. Toast
  and peel hazelnuts. Cut butter into 1/2-inch pieces.
  
  Combine  apples, fennel, lemon juice, honey, cider, sambuca, nutmeg,
  allspice and salt in a bowl; toss gently to combine. Cover and set
  aside.
  
  Topping: Combine sugar, nuts, flour and salt in a processor. Pulse
  until nuts are finely ground. Add shortening and butter and pulse
  until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a
  time, pulsing briefly after each addition.  Continue adding water
  until mixture holds together when pinched between your fingers. Do
  not overmix or the dough will be tough. Pat into a disc, wrap in
  plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Spoon the apple mixture into a 9 x 13-inch glass baking dish. Roll
  out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 9 x 13-inch
  rectangle; gently lay the dough over the fruit, tucking in the edges.
  Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and, using a spoon or
  spatula, break crust into 3- or 4-inch irregular squares. Press
  pieces into the apples, "dowdying" the appearance of the dish. Return
  to oven and bake for 20 minutes, until well browned. Let cool 15
  minutes before serving.

      Title: APPLE & NUT POCKETS
 Categories: Desserts, Cookies, Holidays
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      1 x  -Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
      1 x  -DOUGH:
      8 tb Unsalted butter; softened
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ea Large egg
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
  2 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 x  -FILLING:
    2/3 c  Apple butter
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 x  Grated zest of 1 lemon
    1/4 c  Finely chopped walnuts
      1 x  Confectioners' sugar
      1 x  -for dusting
 
  To make the dough: In a medium bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer
  set at high speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add
  the sugar and beat until light in color and texture, about 2 minutes.
  Beat in the egg and vanilla. Sift the flour with the salt and baking
  soda. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating
  well after each addition. Scrape the dough onto a large piece of
  plastic wrap and wrap tightly. Refrigerate until the dough is firm
  enough to roll out, at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight. To
  make the filling: Combine the apple butter, lemon juice, lemon zest,
  and walnuts and mix well. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Divide the
  dough into 4 portions. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out
  one portion of dough to 1/8 inch thickness. (If the dough crumbles,
  work in your hands until malleable.) Using a 3-inch round cookie
  cutter, cut out rounds of the dough. Gather up the scraps to work
  into the remaining dough. Repeat the process until all the dough has
  been used. Place a rounded teaspoon of the filling in the center of
  half of the rounds. Brush the edges of the rounds lightly with water.
  Place the remaining rounds on top of the filled cookies. Using a
  fork, press the edges sealed. Don't worry if cracks appear in the
  surface. Transfer the cookies to ungreased baking sheets. Bake until
  lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and cool
  completely. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving. Makes
  about 20 large cookies. Source: "An Edible Christmas" (A Treasury of

  1 1/2 lb Floury potatoes
      3 ts Salt
      2 oz Butter
      4 tb Self-raising flour
      2    Apples, peeled,cored,chopped
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      3 tb Softened butter
 
  The potatoes must be hot and floury, but either eating apples or
  cooking apples can be used. (Best results with a cooking apple,
  though.) -- Boil the peeled potatoes in well-salted water. Drain and
  cover with a cloth to "dry in their steam". Sieve or rice into a
  warmed mixing bowl, and beat in the fat. Work in sufficient flour to
  make the dough manageable, adding salt to taste. Divide the dough in
  half and roll or pat into 2 rounds of equal size just over 1/2 inch
  thick. Place one round on the warmed bakestone and spread with the
  chopped apple. Cover with the other round of dough and pinch the
  edges together.  -- Bake on the bakestone over a moderate heat until
  brown underneath. Turn using the broadest spatula you have, or two
  spatulas and a friend.  Cook the other side. Remove the cake to a hot
  serving dish.  Carefully peel up one side of the top of the cake,
  spread the apples with the softened butter, and sprinkle them with
  sugar. Fold that half down and do the same to the other side.
  Sprinkle sugar on top, and serve immediately, with thick cool cream.

  melted butter (keep remaining phyllo covered). Layer 5 more phyllo
  sheets on top, brushing each with butter. Spread 2 cups nut mixture
  on top and repeat layering with 6 more phyllo sheets and butter.
  Spread apple mixture on top; repeat layering with 6 more phyllo
  sheets and butter. Sprinkle remaining nut mixture on top; sprinkle
  with bread crumbs and layer with the 6 remaining phyllo sheets and
  butter. With sharp knife, cut lengthwise through pastry and filling
  into 1 1/2 inch-wide strips, then cut diagonally at 2-inch intervals
  to make diamonds. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until golden. Drizzle
  honey on top and bake 5 minutes more. Cool in pan on wire rack. Serve

  Place brisket, the yellow onion, chopped garlic and garlic cloves in a
  large Dutch oven.  Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce
  heat, cover and simmer 2 1/2 hours or until the brisket is tender.
  Drain brisket. (If you wish, you could keep the brisket covered with
  the cooking liquid and refrigerate it overnight. This will help
  prepare for the next day.) In a small saucepan, mix together the
  apple jelly, wine, mustard, green onions, salt, pepper, and curry
  powder. Heat until the jelly melts.
  
  Place brisket in a shallow roasting pan and brush some of the jelly
  mixture over the top.  Bake at 325 degrees F. for 45 minutes, basting
  3 or 4 times with the remaining jelly mixture. Remove the meat to a
  platter to keep warm.  Place the pan over 2 burners and add apple
  juice, stirring to scrape up browned bits on bottom of pan. Bring to
  a boil over medium-high heat. Boil, stirring, until slightly
  thickened and reduced by about half. Pour into a gravy boat. Slice
  meat and garnish with the parsley. Serve with gravy.  Makes 8 servings

   The thicker skinned, late Summer and Fall apples produce a grainier
  texture that's best for applesauce.
   Stir applesauce, sugars, and cider together and cook in a slow oven
  (325 deg F.) for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
   Add spices. Return to oven and cook 1 hour more. Apple butter
  requires long, slow cooking. (Can also be made in a crockpot.)

      Title: APPLE BUTTER/3 METHODS
 Categories: Canning, Crockpot
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     16 c  Apple puree
      1 c  Apple cider
      4 c  Sugar; granulated
      4 c  Brown sugar
      4 ts Cinnamon
 
    This same recipe can be used to make apple, grape, peach, pear or
  plum butters.  In general use 1 cup fruit pulp to 1/2 cup sugar.
  Spice to taste and cook slowly. To make apple butter, use tart
  cooking apples, not the sweet eating varieties. If sweet apples are
  all you have to use, reduce the sugar by 1/3 to 1/2.
     Wash, quarter and core the unpeeled fruit.  Place in a heavy
  kettle with just enough water to prevent scorching. Cook until soft,
  stirring frequently,  and press through a food mill. Mix ingredients
  in a heavy kettle and cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until
  thick. When ready, a spoonful put on a plate should hold its shape
  and not 'weep' liquid around the edges of the mound after sitting for
  five minutes. This usually takes about two hours of cooking but can
  take as long as four, so plan this project for a day when you have
  other things to do in the kitchen. Don't try and hurry the process as
  the mixture can easily burn and burned apple butter is only good for
  the compost pile. Stir frequently, and if possible use a 'heat
  difuser' between the burner and the kettle.
    Oven Method:  Cook the fruit butter in a roasting pan in a 250 -
  300 F. oven until thick;  may take 6 to 8 hours. Stir occasionally.
  It needs less stirring this way but uses take much more energy and
  can be awkward to stir.
    Crockpot Method:  Put ingredients in crockpot and cook, uncovered,
  for about 12 hours, stirring occasionally, until it passes the test
  given above.
     When finished, pack into jars per standard canning methods and
  process pints 5 minutes or quarts 10 minutes in a boiling water bath.

      2    Granulated sugar
      1    Brown sugar
    3/4    Apple cider
           Spices:
    1/2    Nutmeg
    1/4    Allspice
    3/4    Ground cloves
      3    Cinnamon
 
     The thicker skinned, late Summer and Fall apples produce a grainier
  texture that's best for applesauce. Stir applesauce, sugars, and cider
  together and cook in a slow oven(325 deg F.) for 3 hours, stirring
  occasionally. Add spices. Return to oven and cook 1 hour more. Apple
  butter requires long, slow cooking. (Can also be made in a crockpot.)

 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 9"x9" cake
 
      2 tb Butter or margarine
    1/4 c  Honey
    1/4 c  Date sugar
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
      1 pn Cloves
      1 pn Nutmeg
      1    Apple; peeled, cored,
           -- sliced about 1/8" thick
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
      1 c  Pitted dates
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/4 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Baking powder
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Melt first 2 ingredients together in a 9"-square cake pan by putting
  the pan with the ingredients into the oven as it is preheating.
  
  While the ingredients are melting, mix the next 4 ingredients
  together and then mix them into the melted butter and honey. Lay
  apple slices in the syrup to completely cover the bottom of the cake
  pan in an attractive way. (You may need more than one apple if you
  use a small one.)
  
  Fill a 1-cup measuring cup with pitted dates, but don't pack the
  dates into the cup.  With the dates in the cup, fill the cup with
  water, then pour both dates and water into a blender. Add 1/2 cup
  more water into the blender.  Now blend till it forms a smooth, thick
  paste. Add the 1/4 cup butter or margarine and blend till totally
  whipped in. Put the blender mixture into a mixing bowl and add the
  last 5 dry ingredients. Mix just long enough to thoroughly blend in
  all the dry ingredients. Pour this batter on top of apple slices and
  spread evenly in the cake pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40
  minutes or till a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes
  out clean. When done, remove from oven and immediately turn the cake
  pan upside down to empty out onto a serving platter.

  tablespoon granulated sugar. With two knives, cut the shortening into
  theflour until mixture is mealy.  Store in a zip lock bag, Peel the
  apples and slice them. Put them in a zip lock bag with 1 tablespoon
  of lemon juice and any finely chopped lemon peel that is available.
  Apple mixture may be frozen. Mix the cinnamon, nutmeg, and t
  tablespoons of sugar and stone in a small ziplock bag. At the camp
  site: Make a well in the center of the flour mixture in the bag and
  add the water. Stir the mixture to form smooth batter, turn into
  greased smaller pot. Arrange the apples in rows on top, pushing them
  halfway into the dough. Sprinkle over the apples and dot with apricot
  jam. Cut small pieces of butter over all. Cover the cake pot with lid
  or heavy duty foil.  Put the smaller pot inside the larger one and
  fill along the sides with hot water until the water is about 2/3 or
  3/4 of the way up the sides of the cake pot. Place the lid on the
  large pot and place it on the edge of the fire so the water simmers
  and just boils. Check from time to time and add more water as it
  boils down. As longas the water does not boil dry, this cannot be
  overcooked.

    1/3 c  Margarine or butter; plus...
      2 tb Margarine or butter
    1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
      6 oz Shredded cheddar cheese
    1/2 c  Ice water

  Combine 2 cups flour, corn meal and salt.  Cut in 1/3 cup margarine
  and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cheese.
  Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring lightly until mixture
  forms a ball. Divide dough into 2 parts, 1 slightly larger; shape
  each to form ball. Wrap securely in plastic wrap or wax paper; chill
  about 30 minutes. Roll large ball on lightly floured surface to form
  11-inch circle. Fit loosely into 9-inch pie plate; trim. Roll
  remaining dough to form 12-inch square. Cut into 12 x 3/4-inch
  strips.*
  
  Heat oven to 400 F.  Combine remaining 1/3 cup flour, apples, sugar
  and cinnamon; spoon into crust.  Dot with remaining 2 tablespoons
  margarine. Weave strips atop filling to make a lattice crust. Trim
  even with outer rim of pie plate.  Fold lower crust over strips; seal
  and flute. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until crust is light golden
  brown, shielding edges with aluminum foil if necessary.  Cool
  slightly.
  
  *NOTE: To make a double crust pie, roll remaining dough to form
  10-inch circle instead of cutting strips. Prepare filling as
  directed. Place top crust over filling; trim. Turn edges under;
  flute. Cut slits in top crust to allow steam to escape.

  Pats comments.... "This bread is really good. It can be used on the
  timer. On my Panasonic I use the regular cycle, but with the light
  crust due to all the juices in it. Makes a beautiful high rising loaf
  with a warm cinnamon color. Definitely use the vital gluten as it
  rises much better. I use frozen apple juice concentrate. You could
  also add raisins or chopped apples, either fresh or dried, or even
  nuts might be nice. Fits McD beautifully, don't you think?!"

      2 tb Cinnamon
      5 tb Sugar
      5    To 6 cups sliced apples (I
           Used Granny Smiths)

MMMMM------------------------FOR THE CAKE-----------------------------
      2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Oil (I used applesauce)
      4 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Orange juice
      1 pn Salt
      4    Eggs (or equivalent),
           Lightly beaten
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           Flour
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Nutmeg
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 12-cup tube or bundt pan with
  Pam.
  
  Combine cinnamon and sugar and set aside 1 tablespoon. Toss prepared
  apples with remainder and set aside.
  
  For the cake, whisk together sugar, applesauce, vanilla, oj, salt, and
  eggs.  Combine flour, baking powder, and nutmeg and fold into sugar
  mixture.
  
  Spoon a little more than one third of the batter into prepared pan.
  Cover with half of apple mixture, then spoon in remaining batter and

  it's about 1.5 g/fat for 1/12th of cake.)

      Title: APPLE CRUMB PIE
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      4 c  Apples, tart
      2 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
    1/4 c  Butter, melted
    1/2 c  Nuts, chopped
           -(walnuts, pecans, etc.)
      1    Pie crust
 
  Core, peel and slice the apples.  Melt the butter and mix the rest in
  with it. Pour over apples and mix around so the apples are coated.
  Put in an unbaked pie shell.
  
  Combine brown sugar, flour, melted butter and nuts. Spread over top
  of the filling.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 50 minutes, or until it
  is bubbling.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  One-crust apple-crumb pie -- The pie can also be frozen and then
  baked, right from the freezer, at 360 for 90 minutes. The pies will
  keep a very long time in the freezer and not be worse for wear.
  
  *  PS:  For those who like the quality of home-made pie crusts but the
  convenience of ready-made, make a bunch of crusts someday when the
  mood grabs you, and put them in the freezer in a big plastic bag.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: APPLE CRUNCH COBBLER
 Categories: Lowfat, Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Instant oat meal
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
    3/4 cn Frozen apple juice
           Concentrate, thawed
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1    Golden delicious apple
      1    Egg replacer
    1/4 ts Baking powder
 
  makes 1 8-9" pan full
  
  Cut the apple into bite sized pieces.  Mix together everything except
  the apples.  Put a thin layer (1/8-1/4") of mixture on the bottom of a
  non-stick or Pammed round pan. Put apples on top of this. Then spread,
  plop, drop or get the rest of the mix on top of the apples *some
  way*. Then bake at 350F. I baked it for 25 minutes but it made the
  apples really mushy so next time I'll probably only bake it for 15-17
  minutes.
  
  I thought this turned out really good.  My husband even liked it and
  he thinks that there isn't anyway that a fatfree dessert can taste
  good. :-) Date:

      Title: APPLE CUSTARD
 Categories: Try, It
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 tb Honey
      2 c  Apple juice; or apple-berry
           -blend
  1 1/2 tb Arrowroot; or cornstarch
      1 tb Water
    1/4 c  Tahini
 
  Combine juice and honey, and bring to a boil.  Make a paste of
  arrowroot or cornstarch and water.  Stir paste into hot juice and
  cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick.
  
  Maximum thickening occurs just at the boiling point. If using
  arrowroot, remove from heat because boiling has a thinning effect; if
  using cornstarch, boil gently for 1 minute to remove the raw starch
  taste.
  
  Stir in tahini.  Reduce heat to low and mix until smooth. Pour
  mixture into a large bowl or 4 individual dishes. Let cool, then
  chill.
  
  Tahini is a thick, smooth paste made of raw, ground sesame seeds.
  
  A custard made without eggs?  Yes, and look, no cholesterol! This
  healthy refinement has just the right texture and flavor.

      1 c  Sugar

    1/4 ts Salt

  Bake in 6 x 9 inch pan (my Mom seems to have the only pan that size,

        8 x  8 works OK).
  
  Double the recipe if you are using a 9 x 13 pan.  I have used rhubarb

      1/8    -inch slices
        1 TB sugar mixed with
      1/2 ts ground cinnamon
  
  You must have a non-stick skillet or this won't work. Whisk sugar,
  flour, baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt together. Beat milk with
  eggs and vanilla and whisk this into batter; let stand while you cook
  the apples.
  
  Melt the butter in a large skillet. When foaming subsides, add the
  apples, cover and cook gently for 5 minutes or until soft. Uncover,
  raise the heat and evaporate the moisture. When the moisture has
  almost completely evaporated, add the sugar and finish boiling the
  juices away.
  
  Preheat the broiler with rack set 6 to 7 inches away from heat source.
  
  Oil the bottom and sides of a 10-inch non-stick pan with butter or
  non-stick vegetable cooking spray and heat for a minute. Add 1/3 cup
  of batter to the pan and tilt so it is well coated. Set skillet on
  very low heat and cook for 30 seconds. Gently arrange about 1/4 of
  the apple mixture on the first pancake. Pour in 1/3 cup more batter
  over the apples to cover them as best as possible. Cook pancake for a
  minute over medium heat, lower the heat and cook 2 minutes longer.
  Broil for about 3 minutes or until pancake is cooked through and
  golden. With a spatula loosen pancake around the edges and transfer
  to a platter (cover loosely with foil until all 4
  
  pancakes are done or serve immediately). Repeat procedure with other 3
  pancakes; serve dusted with confectioner's sugar.

      Title: APPLE FILLED SQUASH HALVES
 Categories: Fruits, Hamburger, Meats, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 ea Acorn Squash; Md
      1 lb Lean Ground Beef
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      2 c  Apples; Pared & Chopped,2 Lg
    1/4 c  Raisins
      1 x  Salt
      4 tb Brown Sugar; Packed
      2 tb Margarine Or Butter; Melted
 
  Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Cut each of the squash in half and
  remove the seeds and fibers.  Place the squash, cut sides down, in an
  ungreased baking pan. Then add water to the depth of 1/4-inch and
  bake, uncovered, until the squash is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.
  While the squash is baking, cook and stir the meat in a large skillet
  until it is brown. Drain off the excess fat.  Remove the skillet from
  the heat and stir in the 1 1/2 ts of salt as well as the cinnamon,
  the coarsely chopped tart apples and the raisins. When the squash is
  cooked, turn them so that the cut side is up and remove them to a
  platter. Drain off any remaining liquid in the pan and dry. Scoop out
  the pulp from the acorn squash, making a shell that is 1/4-inch thick
  all the way around. Season the shells with salt to taste. Mash the
  pulp and mix in the meat mixture. Return to the shells, piling them
  full and sprinkle with 1 tb of brown sugar on each. Drizzle with the
  melted butter.  Bake uncovered until the apple is tender, about 20 to
  30 minutes.  Serve hot. NOTE: You can substitute a combination of 1/2
  lb lean ground beef and 1/2 lb of bulk pork sausage for the 1 lb of
  lean ground beef.

      Title: APPLE FILLING FOR STRUDEL
 Categories: Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           *INGREDIENTS*
     10 c  Apples, slices thin
      1    Stick butter
      1 c  Bread crumbs, very fine
      1 c  Sugar, or more if apples are
           -tart
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1    Lemon rind (grandma does NOT
           -use this)
    1/2    Stick butter, melted
 
  Source: Treasured Slovenian & International Recipes
  
  *DIRECTIONS* Melt stick of butter and lightly brown the bread crumbs.
  Set aside to cool. Sprinkle the cooled bread crumbs over the
  stretched dough. Spread the sliced apples evenly over the dough and
  sprinkle sugar, cinnamon and lemon rind over the apples. Melt the 1/2
  stick of butter and when it has cooled spoon over the apples. Roll up
  dough. Place in well greased pan and bake in 350 F oven for one hour.
  
  notes: Be careful not to puncture the dough when transferring to the
  pan, otherwise the strudel will stick to the pan.
  
  *VARIATIONS* Instead of lemon rind Grandma uses lemon juice. Grandma
  also waits until the dough is ready to slice the apples, that way
  they don't turn brown. She also uses the slicer on the side of a
  grater to slice the apples really thin.

      Title: APPLE FLORENTINE
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6    Large apples
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 ts Grated lemon rind
      1    Egg yolk for glazing
      2 c  Ale
    1/2 ts Powdered nutmeg
      1    Stick of cinnamon
      2    Cloves
 
  Peel and core the apples.  Put close together in a deep 10 inch pie
  dish and sprinkle with six tablespoons sugar mixed with the lemon
  rind. Pour in 3 tablespoons water.  Roll out pastry 1/4" thick and
  cover apples. Make a 1 inch wide hole in the center of the pastry and
  put a small collar of pastry around it, wetting it slightly with cold
  water to join. Brush pie with egg yolk beaten with 2 teaspoons cold
  water. Bake in a preheated 400F oven for 30-35 minutes. Meanwhile,
  bring the ale, remaining sugar, and spices slowly to the boiling
  point, but do not boil; let spices steep in hot ale. When apple pie
  is done, pour hot ale into center hold through a funnel and serve
  immediately. Note: Whole apples go into the deep-dish pie that warms
  many an Englishman, especially in Bedfordshire, at Christmas. As the
  name suggests, Apple Florentine has Italian origins, though the
  Resaissance pope for whom it was occasionally prepared never knew the
  special savor of well-spiced ale that English cooks consder an
  indispensible part of the recipe.

  1 1/2    To 1 3/4 cups unsifted
           -all-purpose
           Flour
      1 pk Rapid-rising dry yeast
    1/2 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Very warm water (120 degrees
           -to
    130    Degrees F)
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Honey
      1 tb Butter
      1 lg Golden delicious or other
           Sweet firm apple, peeled,
           -cored,
           And cut into 1/4-inch thick
           -slices
    1/4 ts Coarse (kosher) salt
           (optional)
 
  Sweet apples and salty bread provide an intriguing contrast in taste.
  To ensure that the hearth bread remains light and crisp, keep the
  dough soft: Don't work in too much flour and knead it gently.
  
  Makes 1 loaf (6 servings)
  
  1. In large bowl of heavy-duty electric mixer, combine 1 1/2 cups
  flour, the yeast, and salt. Slowly beat in water, 1/4 cup olive oil,
  and the honey; vigorously beat mixture 10 minutes. Cover bowl with
  clean cloth and let dough rise in warm place, away from drafts, 40
  minutes.
  
  2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt butter. Add apple slices and
  saute' until very lightly browned; set aside.
  
  3. After dough has risen 40 minutes, turn out onto floured surface.
  Gently knead in as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour as necessary to
  form a very soft dough - about 1 minute. Gently work apple slices
  into the dough.
  
  4. Lightly oil large baking sheet. With floured fingers, shape dough
  into a 9 inch round on oiled sheet. Cover with clean cloth and let
  rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in size - about
       30    minutes.
  
  5. Heat oven to 400 degrees F. With pastry brush, coat top of dough
  round with 2 tablespoons olive oil; sprinkle with coarse salt, if
  desired. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until hearth bread is browned.
  
  6. Drizzle hearth bread with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and
  serve warm.

 Categories: Scot/irish, Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 2/3 c  Flour; all-purpose
      1 tb Baking powder
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      4 tb Butter; melted
      2    Eggs; beaten
  1 1/4 c  Milk
      2    Good eating apples; not

           .  and cored
           Sunflower oil for frying

MMMMM----------------------CINNAMON BUTTER---------------------------
      1    Stick butter; softened
      2 ts Cinnamon
    3/4 c  Soft light brown sugar
 
  First make the cinnamon butter. Beat all the ingredients together
  until the mixture is smooth. Store in a covered container in the
  refrigerator until serving. (This keeps for 7-10 days.)
  
  Sift the flour, baking powder, sugar and cinnamon into a bowl. Beat
  in the melted butter, beaten eggs and milk. Grate the apples into the
  mixture and mix in well.
  
  Oil a griddle, or a heavy-basedfrylng pan, or an electric hotplate,
  or if you have an Aga or Rayburn, the cooler hotplate. (For my
  American readers an Aga is a constantly burning range-like cooker
  with two or four ovens and hotplates. It gives an even heat and very
  consistent results.) Drop spoonsful of the apple batter on to the
  oiled surface, making pancakes of 2-3 inches / 5-7-5cm in diameter
  and leaving a space between them. Cook for about 2 minutes or until
  small bubbles appear over the surface, then, with a palette knife
  (pancake turner), slip each over to cook on the other side.
  
  As they cook, remove the pancakes and keep them warm on a plate, and
  covered with a cloth. When all the pancakes are cooked, serve them
  hot with the cinnamon butter. "Lady MacDonald's Scotland: The Best of

    3/4 c  Bottled lemon juice
      1 ts Nutmeg (optional)
      7 dr Yellow food coloring
           -(optional)
 
  Quality: Use firm, crisp apples. Stayman, Golden Delicious, Rome, and
  other varieties of similar quality are suitable. If apples lack
  tartness, use an additional 1/4 cup of lemon juice for each 6 quarts
  of slices.
  
  Yield: 1 quart or 7 quarts
  
  Procedure: Wash, peel, and core apples. Prepare slices 1/2-inch wide
  and place in water containing ascorbic acid to prevent browning. For
  more information see "Ensuring High-Quality Canned Foods".
  
  For fresh fruit, place 6 cups at a time in 1 gallon of boiling water.
  Boil each batch 1 minute after the water returns to a boil. Drain,
  but keep heated fruit in a covered bowl or pot. Combine sugar, Clear
  Jel(tm) , and cinnamon in a large kettle with water and apple juice.
  If desired, food coloring and nutmeg may be added. Stir and cook on
  medium high heat until mixture thickens and begins to bubble. Add
  lemon juice and boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. Fold in drained
  apple slices immediately and fill jars with mixture without delay,
  leaving 1 inch headspace. Adjust lids and process immediately
  according to the recommendations in Table 1. See Table 2 for
  suggested quantities.

      Title: APPLE PIE FILLING   (TO FREEZE OR CAN)
 Categories: Pies, Desserts, Apples
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  4 1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
     10 c  Water
      1 c  Cornstarch
      1 ts Salt
     24 c  Apples; peeled,sliced
      2 ts Cinnamon
      3 ts Lemon juice
 
  Blend sugar, nutmeg, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon. Add water and cook
  till clear.  Add apples and lemon juice and cook till apples are
  soft. Pack in jars/containers.  To make pie, make crust and bake.
  Into prepared crust, put thawed filling and bake until warmed
  through. Crumb topping can be added before baking filling if you want
  (I use sugar, cinnamon, margarine and chopped pecans.) I found that
  the thickener (the flour, water, etc. mix that is cooked first) made
  a lot more than could be used up by 24 c of apples.  I think I got a
  total of 8-10 large containers (I use empty 32 oz yogurt containers).
  One of these containers was just enough for a 9 in pie. I also used
  (don't tell anybody) prepared pie shells just fine with this filling.
  I also used a large nonstick pot to cook this in and had very little
  problem with sticking at medium to medium high temperature.

  *    Use tart cooking apples such as Macs or Granny Smith's. Core,
  pare +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++ ++++ CHEDDAR CRUST: Combine the flour, cheese and salt
  in a bowl. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the
  shortening until coarse crumbs form. Sprinkle the iced water (5 or 6
  tbls will be needed) and using a fork, toss the crumbs until a dough
  is formed. Press the dough firmly into a ball. FILLING: Divide the
  pastry almost in half and roll out the larger half, on a lightly
  floured surface, to a 13-inch circle. Line a 9-inch pie plate with
  the pastry, trimming the edges to 1/2-inch beyond the rim of the pie
  plate.  (Note:  When lining the pie plate, be careful not to stretch
  the pastry when spreading it out. This will cause holes or the pastry
  will shrink and the filling will run over in the oven as it is baked.
  Place in the pie plate and gently, working from the center, spread
  the pastry out until it covers the bottom of the pie plate and then
  lay the rest of the pastry over the rim and trim.)  Combine the
  apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl, mixing well. Arrange
  the apple mixture in the pastry lined pie plate. Roll out the
  remaining pastry to an 11-inch circle. Gently fold into quarters and
  cut steam slits in the folds. Unfold the crust and place on top of
  the filling, trimming the crust to 1-inch beyond the rim of the pie
  plate.  Fold the top crust under the lower one and flute to form a
  ridge around the edge of the pie plate. Combine the egg yolk and
  water, then brush the mixture over the top crust and rim. Bake in a
  400 degree F. oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until apples are tender
  and the crust is a golden brown. Cool on a wire rack until slightly
  warm and serve with Vanilla Ice Cream, if desired.

    3/4 c  Skim milk
      2 tb Vegetable oil*
      1 ea Jar chunky apple sauce
      1 ea Large egg
      8 ea Large ripe strawberries
      1 x  Powdered sugar
      1 x  Cinnamon
 
  Mix the  pancake mix, milk, egg and oil in a 2 cup measure. OK to
  have a little rough mixture. Make the mixture a little thinner than
  regular batter but thicker than for a crepe.
    Heat an 8" shallow Teflon (sloped sided) pan with a drop of oil on
  medium heat. Pour in 1/4 of the batter (enough to make a thin
  pancake. Allow the dough to cook until the bubbles form on top but
  the pk is not cooked all the way through. The bottom should be a
  light golden brown. Scoop 3 Tbs of apple sauce on one half of the
  pancake. Quickly fold the other half over so it puffs up. Cook for
  about a minute or so (being careful not to burn). Turn over briefly
  to cook other side and warm the apples.
    Serve each on a large platter and top with cinnamon and sliced
  strawberries Finish with a little powdered sugar.
    I think what happened was that the applesauce mixed with the still
  uncooked pancake top and was cooked (combined) to make an unusual
  fluffy inside. * Use one Tb of oil to cut fat. ...George

  Process on "dough" cycle. The filling would be 1/2 cup melted
  margarine or butter (I use 1/4 cup) topped with 1 cup brown sugar
  mixed with 3 TBS cinnamon. (I add raisins and nuts.) The topping is 4
  oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter or margarine (I skip this) 1/2 tsp.
  vanilla, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar and a teaspoon or two of milk.
  I've done these both "full fat" and "reduced fat." It's hard to tell
  the difference, so we go "reduced," including using light
  (Neufchatel) cream cheese. I've tried ALL the fat free cream cheeses
  and NONE of them work. JUDITH PENZINER (GGMB18A)JUDITH PENZINER

      Title: APPLE STREUSEL CHEESECAKE
 Categories: Kooknet, Cyberealm, Cheesecake, Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Cheesecake
 
 
    I make this cheesecake often, especially in the fall. I don't use
  special recipe, just make a plain, New York type cheesecake, but add
  apple pie spices like cinnamon and nutmeg (to taste). Then add diced
  fresh apples to taste (couple of cups usually). Then top the whole
  thing with a streusel topping (butter, sugar and a little flour all
  cut up together) like you would put on a Dutch Apple Pie and bake as
  the directions for the plain cheesecake suggest.
    It is wonderful.

 Categories: Pies/pastry, Fruits
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Pie shell, 9"; unbaked
      3    Apples, pared and thinly
           -sliced
      3 tb Flour
    1/2 c  Flour
      2 tb Butter, melted
     27 oz Mincemeat
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/3 c  Butter, cold
    1/4 c  Nuts, chopped
 
  In large bowl, toss apples with 3 tablespoons flour and melted butter;
  arrange in pastry shell.  Top with mincemeat. In medium bowl, combine
  remaining 1/2 c flour, sugar and cinnamon; cut in cold butter until
  crumbly.  Add nuts; sprinkle over mincement.  Bake in lower half of
  425 degrees oven 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees; bake 25
  minutes longer or until golden. Cool. Garnish as desired.
  
  PAT'S NOTES FROM 1/95:  This pie was excellent.  I used reconstituted
  mincemeat (1 box) and as many apples as were needed to fill the pie
  plate - lots more than the recipe calls for. I increased the amount
  of topping to add sweetness because of the increased number of tart
  apples.

  as possible over the wax paper.  Original recipe used 10 inch skillet
  with ovenproof handle. Arrange apple slices (or chunks) in butter
  sauce.

  mixing bowl.  In second bowl, beat together sugar, egg, egg white,
  oil, milk and vanilla. Combine with dry ingredients until just
  blended. Fold in currants (or raisins) and grated apple.  Leave the
  skin on the apple for extra fiber if you are using a food processor
  for the grating.
  
  Pour into pan over apple layer.  Bake at 350 F for 25 to 30 minutes or
  until cake tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean. Set
  aside to let cool.

 Categories: Side dish
      Yield: 1 Recipes
 
      8 c  Bread, cut into 1" cubes
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
    1/2 c  Diced onion
    1/4 c  Fresh parsley
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 ts Pepper
      2    Peeled cored & diced apples
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
 
    Preheat your oven to 325 degrees.  Place bread cubes in a large
  bowl. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Chop the
  parsley. Add celery, onion and parsley to the butter and cook,
  stirring occasionally, until softened. This should take about five
  minutes. Mix all this with the bread. Now beat the eggs. Mix eggs,
  broth and pepper; add this to the bread and mix it all real well.
  Stir in apples and walnuts. Bake in greased 2-quart dish for 25
  minutes. If you like your stuffing a little crispy, go ahead and cook
  it for a little longer. When it's done, serve it up! This one'll go
  quick, and if your kin likes stuffing as much as mine, you may want
  to double all the ingredients to make a little extra for the day
  after! Submitted By RHOMMEL <RHOMMEL@IX.NETCOM.COM> On FRI, 1 DEC

        8    tart apples -- peel, core
  :          and
  :          quarter
  :          (Granny Smith)
        1 c  white port
        6 c  chicken broth
        4 sl bacon -- for garnish
  :          (apple- or hickory-smoked)
        1 sm red apple -- for garnish
  :          (such Red Delicious)
        1 sm tart green apple -- for
  :          garnish
  :          (as Granny Smith)
        1    lemon -- juiced
        4 TB unsalted butter -- softened
      1/4 c  all-purpose flour
    1 1/2 lb sharp Cheddar cheese --
  :          grated
  :          Salt -- to taste
  :          Tabasco -- to taste
  
  Cold weather soup, diced apples and cheese make it colorful. Easily
  made without the ham or bacon.  Use vegetable broth instead of the
  chicken stock.
  
  To make the soup, in a medium-sized saucepan heat the oil over
  medium-high heat. Add the ham scraps, if using, the celery, garlic,
  and onions and saute for about 4 minutes, or until the onions are
  translucent but not brown.
  
  Reduce the heat to medium and add the quartered apples. Cover and
  cook, stirring frequently, for abour 10 minutes or until the apples
  soften. Add the port and simmer for 5 minutesmore. Add the chicken
  stock, bouquet garni, and ham bone, if using. Reduce the heat to low
  and simmer, partially covered, for about 20 minutes, or until the
  flavors are well blended. Remove the bouquet garni.
  
  (The soup may be made a day or two in advance, up to this point. Cool
  and refrigerate. See detail 'A'.)
  
  Meanwhile in a small skillet, fry the bacon over medium heat for
  about 5 minutes, or until browned and crisp. Drain on paper towels.
  Cut into l inch dice and set aside.
  
  Leaving the skin on, cut the green and red apples into 1/8-inch dice
  to use for garnish. You will need about 2 tablespoons of each color.
  Put the diced apples in a small glass or ceramic bowl and sprinkle
  with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Set aside.
  
  In a small bowl, knead the softened butter and flour together until
  smooth to make a beurre manie'. Whisk the mixture into the soup to
  thicken it. Cook for 5 minutes longer, stirring frequently.
  
  Add the grated cheese to the soup, stirring constantly, until it is
  melted.
  
  Strain the soup through a fine sieve into the top of double boiler
  set over gently boiling water to keep the soup hot. (Do not press too
  hard on the solids.) season with the remaining lemon juice and salt
  and Tabasco to taste. Ladle the soup into warm serving bowls and
  garnish with the diced apples and chopped bacon. Serve hot.
  
  Detail 'A' continued:  Add the Beurre manie and then the cheese and
  seasonings, when you reheat the soup for serving. Do not prepare the
  apple and bacon garnish until a few hours before serving. This soup
  can be completed up to 2 hours before serving, but keep it warm in
  the top half of a double boiler set over hot water. Do not simmer
  over direct heat after the cheese has been added or the soup will
  separate. Recipe By : Dean Fearing, Chef at Turtle Creek (1989)
