  the flour, salt, pepper and baking powder. Stir in the beaten egg,
  milk (enough to make fairly moist, stiff batter), and melted butter.
  Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the hot liquid with the ham and
  apples. Cover kettle tight and cook dumplings for 15 minutes. Serve
  piping hot on large platter. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book -

      Title: APPLES - SLICED
 Categories: Fruits, Canning
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 19 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
  quarts; an average of 12-1/4 pounds is needed per canner load of 9
  pints. A bushel weighs 48 pounds and yields 16 to 19 quarts-an
  average of 2-3/4 pounds per quart.
  
  Quality: Select apples that are juicy, crispy, and preferably both
  sweet and tart.
  
  Procedure: Wash, peel, and core apples. To prevent discoloration,
  slice apples into water containing ascorbic acid. Raw packs make poor
  quality products. Place drained slices in large saucepan and add 1
  pint water or very light, light, or medium syrup (see "Preparing and
  Using Syrups") per 5 pounds of sliced apples. Boil 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Fill jars with hot slices
  and hot syrup or water, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and
  process.
  
  Processing directions for canning sliced apples in a boiling-water, a
  dial, or a weighted-gauge canner are given in Table 1, Table 2, and
  Table 3.
  
  Table 1. Recommended process time for Apples, sliced in a
  boiling-water canner.
  
  Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Pints or Quarts. Process Time at

      Title: APPLES IN RED WINE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 kg Apples (2 1/4 lb)
           -- You NEED an apple that
           -- will hold its shape
           -- during cooking !!
      5 dl Red wine ( 1 pint)
      1    Stick cinnamon
    250 g  Sugar (9 oz)
 
  Ten hours in advance, cook the wine, cinnamon and sugar over a brisk
  heat for 10 minutes, using a broad, shallow saucepan.
  
  Peel the apples and, using a melon-baller of about 2.5 cm (1 in)
  diameter, cut them into little balls.
  
  Throw the apple-balls into the hot wine. They should not overlap:
  this is why you need a broad, shallow pan. Simmer them for 5 to 7
  minutes, covered with aluminium foil to keep them submerged.
  
  When the apples are cooked but still firm, remove the pan from the
  stove. Let the apple-balls macerate in the red wine for about 10
  hours to take on a good red colour.
  
  Serving: well chilled, with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, or in a
  selection of cold fruit desserts.

    Sterilize 5 straight-sided Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400- 81400)
  canning jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Keep the
  lids and rings in the water until you're ready to use them. Remove
  the jars from the water and place them on a clean dish towel to
  air-dry (up, not upside down). When the jars are cool enough to
  handle, grease the insides with shortening (DO NOT use butter,
  margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret); set aside.
  
    Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon
  and cloves; set aside.
  
    Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a
  time until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and
  water. Blend the dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in
  the nuts.; set aside. Fill well greased jars half full. Place the
  jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll tip over.
  
    Bake for 35 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. like you
  would any canned goods.
  
    The method for making the cakes is the same -- no matter which
  recipe you use. The only difference will be the ingredients (of
  course), the amount of jars needed and the baking times- -that's all,
  everything else is the same. Don't limit yourself to the recipes I'm
  giving you -- use your favorite quick-bread recipe. I plan on trying
  the Carrot Cake recipe I posted.

      Title: APPLESAUCE CAKE IN JARS
 Categories: Desserts, Fruit, Canned
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  ELLIE COLLIN CMKD93F
    2/3 c  SHORTENING
  2 2/3 c  GRANULATED SUGAR
      4 ea Large EGGS
      2 c  APPLESAUCE
    2/3 c  WATER
  3 1/3 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, sifted
    1/2 ts BAKING POWDER
      2 ts BAKING SODA
  1 1/2 ts SALT
      1 ts GROUND CINNAMON
      2 ts GROUND CLOVES
    2/3 c  NUTS; chopped,optional
 
  Sterilize 8 (12 oz Ball Quilted Crystal - #14400-81400) canning jars,
  lids and rings by boiling for 10 minutes. Remove the jars and allow
  to air-dry and cool. Leave the  lids and rings in the hot water until
  ready to use. Once the jars are cool enough to handle, grease them
  (use a pastry brush) with shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's
  Secret); set aside. Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in
  the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add
  the applesauce and water; set aside. In another bowl, sift together
  the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves.
  Blend dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the nuts.
  Pour batter into the jars, filling them about 1/2 full. Place jars
  onto a cookie sheet or they'll fall over. Bake in a preheated
  325-degree oven for 35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into
  the center of each cake  comes out clean. Remove jars from the oven,
  one-at-a-time (use HEAVY-DUTY MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!); place a lid,
  then a ring on  top and screw down tightly.
   Place jars onto your counter top to cool. You'll know when the jars
  have sealed, you'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you missed the sound,
  test them by pressing down on the lids once the jars have
  cooled--they shouldn't move at  all.
   Store jars in a cool, dry place. They should keep for about a year.
  I've only been able to keep them for a few weeks, they don't last
  that long around here. They're wonderful for last minute gifts,
  especially for single friends.

  well. Pour cake mixture into wide-mouth canning jars. WARNING: Please
  use only canning jars that are specially tempered. Do not use cans or
  other jars that may not be appropriate for this method due to lead
  content. Or, use a special crockpot baking pan available thruough
  Rival Co. To assure that baked cakes will slip out easily, grease
  inside of jars well. (Lining bottom of jars with waxed paper also
  will help.) Cover each jar with a piece of foil greased on one side.
  Place greased side down and press foil around edges to seal tightly.
  Place jars in crockpot with crockery liner in place. Cover; cook on
  high-heat setting for 2 3/4 to 3 hours or till cakes spring back when
  touched and a wooden tothpick inserted near the centers comes out
  clean. Remove jars from cooker; cool 10 minutes. Unmold cakes; remove
  waxed paper. Serve warm or cool with whipped topping, if desired.

 Categories: Misc, Apples
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -applesauce
           -cinnamon
 
  Take one regular sized can of applesauce and add enough cinnamon to
  make a dough.  Roll out and cut into shapes then bake in a VERY slow
  oven say 150 to 250 until completely dry. Let them air dry over night
  before using. If you are going to use for hanging ornaments punch a
  hole in the top with a straw(drinking kind). This recipe used a lot
  of cinnamon so drain the applesause first then add the spice. You can
  use any spice, apple pie or pumpkin pie spice are nice too. So is a
  little nutmeg added to the cinnamon.

      Title: APPLESAUCE OATMEAL DROPS
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 c  White sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Natural unsweetened
           Applesauce
      1 c  Rolled oats
      1 c  Sifted all purpose flour
    1/2 c  Seedless raisins
 
  Mix sugars and add applesauce.  Sift together dry ingrediants and
  stir in. Add oats and raisins.  Drop by spoonfuls onto lightly
  greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees about 10 minutes.
  
  Note:  I left out the raisins because I don't care for them. Also, I
  added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  The next time I make these I may cut back
  on the sugar because they are rather sweet. These cookies were nice
  and fluffy (for a fat-less cookie) and remind me of muffins. These
  are so quick and easy to make, I just love them! I hope everyone
  enjoys them.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Applesauce jello salad -- A delicious jello salad, taken from The
  Monterey Coast Guard Officers' Wives Club Cookbook. My sister-in-law
  was the president of the club which put that cookbook together.
  
  *  Substituting apple cider or apple juice for the water adds
  tremendous taste.  We prefer homemade chunky style applesauce to
  processed commercial brands.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1-3 hours to chill.

        1 TB Dijon Mustard
  :            -Gingered Applesauce-----
        2 TB Fresh Lemon Juice
        4    Sweet-Tart
  :            -Newtown Pippin
        3 TB Sugar -- Or More If Needed
    1 1/2 ts Peeled Fresh Ginger --
  :            -Finely Grated
  :            -Apples, Mcintosh, Cortland,
  
  1. Preheat the oven to 375 F. Lightly butter a roasting pan. 2.
  Combine the beef, pork, bread crumbs, onion, and garlic in a large
  mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Beat in the
  milk, ketchup, and seasonings and add to the meat. Mix with your
  hands just until well combined. (A wooden spoon won't do the job as
  well as your hands.) 3. Shape the meat into an oval loaf in the
  buttered roasting pan and bake until evenly browned, 50 minutes. 4.
  Combine the applesauce, apple cider, brown sugar, and heat over
  medium heat until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. 5. Pour
  the applesauce mixture over the meat loaf, covering it well, and
  continue baking until the top is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes
  longer. Remove the meat loaf from the oven and let it rest for 5
  minutes before serving. Makes 6 to 8 entree servings.
  
  GINGERED APPLESAUCE 1. Place the lemon juice in a large saucepan.
  Peel, core, and cut each apple into eighths. As you add the apples to
  the pot, toss them to coat with the lemon juice to prevent
  discoloration. 2. Add 1/3 cup water, the sugar, and grated ginger and
  bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until
  the apples are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and mash
  coarsely with a fork. Taste and add more sugar if necessary. The
  applesauce should be be a bit chunky.
  
  VARIATIONS: APPLE-HORSERADISH SAUCE: Substitute 1/2 cup of freshly
  grated peeled horseradish for the ginger. If desired, add 2 cups
  mayonnaise. Great with roast beef.
  
  APPLESAUCE WITH FRESH FRUIT: Substitute 1/2 cup fresh or thawed frozen
  raspberries, peaches , or blueberries for the ginger, and stir in 2
  Tbs brandy or sake. This is great with game or fowl.
  
  PASSION-APPLESAUCE: Omit the ginger. Just after you remove the pan
  from the heat, stir the pulp (seeds and all) of 2 passion fruits into
  the applesauce. This goes well with almost anything, especially
  grilled sausages, smoked pork chops, and venison.
  
  DESSERT APPLESAUCE: Puree the Gingered Applesauce then thin it with
  fresh apple cider to the desired consistency. Use it as a topping for
  ice cream, angel-food cake, or pound cake.

      Title: APPLESCOTCH PIE
 Categories: Pies, Desserts, Apples
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5 c  Apples (tart); (note below)
           -peeled and thinly sliced
      1 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
    1/4 c  Water
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
      3 tb Butter or margarine
      2    Pie crust shells (9");
           -unbaked
 
  Mix together the apples, brown sugar water and lemon juice in a
  2-quart saucepan. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer 7-8
  minutes or JUST until apples are tender.
  
  Mix together the flour, granulated sugar and salt; stir into apple
  mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils.
  Boil and stir 1 minute; remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla and
  butter or margarine; cool.
  
  Preheat oven to 425-degrees. Prepare pastry (or use store-bought).
  Turn apple mixture into pastry-lined pie plate. Cover with top crust
  in which you've cut slits; flute the edges. Cover edge of pie crust
  with foil (or cut out an aluminum pan--keeping just the edge) to
  prevent excessive browning; remove foil during the last 15 minutes of
  baking. Bake 40-45 minutes or until crust is golden brown.
  
  Note: I've found that ANY recipe calling for tart apples, you get more
  flavor by mixing the types of apples. As we have an abundance of
  varied apples,
  
  Fuji's, Granny Smith and Gala's...they all vary in flavor, texture,
  etc. Experiment with your favorite

      Title: APRICOT & RAISIN CHUTNEY
 Categories: Chutneys
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Dried apricots
      1 qt Hot water
     10 lg Garlic cloves
      1 lg Onion -- chopped fine
      1    3" piece of fresh ginger
  1 1/4 c  Vinegar -- (see Note at
           Bottom)
      1 lb Sugar -- (see Note at
           Bottom)
    1/4 ts Salt -- I use at least 1
           Tsp
    1/4 ts Cayenne
      1 c  Raisins
 
  Makes 5 lbs. Rinse and put the apricots in a bowl with the hot water
  (I add the juice of 1 lemon and the cut up lemon peel) Leave to soak
  for 4 hours. Chop the garlic. Peel and chop the ginger. Blend the
  garlic and ginger with a little of the vinegar  until smooth. Put the
  apricots with their soakings water, the onions, the ginger and garlic
  mixture into an preserving kettle with the rest of the vinegar. Add
  the sugar, salt and cayenne. Bring to a boil and simmer gently for 45
  minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.  Add the raisins
  and continue cooking until the chutney thickens and begins to turn
  shiny. Pack into hot clean jars, cover, process and cool. ~-Note
  : I use brown sugar and regular raisins for a dark chutney - I use
  white sugar and golden raisins for a golden chutney. I don't blend
  the garlic and ginger mixture - I simply mince very small or put
  through a garlic press. You can substitute dried ginger for fresh
  ginger. Chutney is not supposed to require a hot water bath, because
  of the acid level from the vinegar - but I give it a hot water bath
  anyway. You can use apple cider vinegar in this recipe. I use a gas
  cooktop - and I cook the simmer the mixture with a simmer plate
  between the pot and the burners. Be sure you use a heavy bottomed pan
  ~ to prevent scorching or burning. PS: I always refrigerate the
  Chutney after opening the jar. "Sweet chutneys provide a delicious
  finishing touch to cold cuts, cheese and salads. This slightly hot,
  spicy way of dealing with dried apricots and raisins is an original
  and ever popular addition to cold, simple fare? Note - I think the
  author meant "traditional" -

    1/2 ts Powdered allspice
      8 oz Walnuts
           -- very roughtly chopped
 
  Split and stone the fresh apricots and chop roughly. If using dried
  apricots, put them to swell overnight in water. Boil the chopped
  onions for a few moments to soften them, otherwise you always seem to
  get a few hard bits.  Drain.  Put all the ingredients except the
  walnuts into a large preserving pan and bring to the boil. Turn down
  the heat and cook gently, stirring regularly, for 1 1/2 hours until
  the mixture is thick and jammy. Stir in the walnuts.  Pot while hot
  in warm sterilised jars. Seal. Makes about 6 lbs.

      Title: APRICOT CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Chicken pieces
      1 pk French onion soup mix
      2 c  Apricot nectar
  1 1/2 lb Apricot halves (canned)
           Flour (plain)
 
  Dust chicken in flour.  Fry chicken lightly until starting to brown.
  Place chicken in a casserole dish or a very deep frying pan. Add soup
  powder, nectar and apricots. Mix everything well. Simmer for 1 hour.
  
  I normally use 2 pieces of chicken per person and about a 1 1/2 lb
  can of apricot halves.  This will suffice for 4 to 6 people. If you
  cannot get nectar, then use the juice from the apricot halves. (Of
  course, if you can buy apricots in nectar...)
  
  The French onion soup quantity is not critical, but a soup packet that
  makes up about 6 C is about right for 4 to 6 people. Serve with potato
  (baked or boiled), buttered carrots and peas.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken embalmed in apricot nectar -- Apricot Chicken is the
  ultimate bachelors delight.  It is very simple and tastes wonderful.
  The recipe was given to me by a group of friends from back home who
  came to visit me. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: APRICOT CRUMBCAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------CAKE BATTER-----------------------------
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter; softened
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1    Egg
      3    Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
     12 md Apricots

MMMMM-----------------------CRUMB TOPPING----------------------------
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter; melted
 
  Use this recipe with peaches, sour cherries or pineapple with equally
  good results.
  
  CAKE BATTER: PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Butter a 10-inch round, 2-inch
  deep cake pan and line the bottom with a disk of parchment or wax
  paper. In a large mixer bowl, beat the butter and sugar until soft
  and light. Add the egg and continue beating until light. Add the
  yolks one at a time, beating well between each addition. Beat in the
  vanilla. Sift together the flour and baking powder and stir into the
  batter. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Rinse and halve
  the apricots. Remove the pits with the bowl of a small spoon if they
  resist. Arrange the apricot halves cut-side up on the batter in
  concentric rows, overlapping slightly, leaving a margin of about
  1-inch around the edge. Don't be concerned if the apricots mound
  slightly in the center of the cake; the top will even out as the cake
  bakes.
  
  CRUMB TOPPING: FOR THE CRUMBS, mix the flour, sugar and cinnamon in a
  bowl. Melt the butter and stir it in evenly. Rub the mixture to
  coarse crumbs by hand. Scatter the crumbs over the apricots and the
  edge of the batter as evenly as possible. Bake the cake 1 hour until
  a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool the cake in the
  pan for about 15 minutes and invert a plate on it. Invert onto the
  plate and lift off the pan. Peel off the paper and invert a rack on
  the cake. Invert cake onto the rack, remove the plate and cool.

  for all the butter.

 Categories: Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
     50 g  Dried apricots
           - preferably unsulphured
    175 g  Greek yogurt
      1    Egg white; stiffly beaten
           Grated chocolate
           -(to decorate)
 
  This recipe is a long-established favourite and can be made at any
  time of the year. If you make it with unsulphured dried apricots the
  result will be noticeably more delicious.
  
  Soak the apricots in water for just 1 hour, then chop them roughly.
  They will be slightly crunchy. Fold them into the yogurt and mix
  well. Fold the stiffly beaten egg white into the mixture and spoon
  into two dishes. Sprinkle with grated chocolate. Serve as soon as
  possible.

      3 lb Lamb leg; butterflied
    1/2 c  Red wine
      1 c  Beef stock; canned/homemade
           Salt
           Ground pepper; to taste
 
  The crisp coating keeps the lamb succulent and juicy. Bake 10 minutes
  longer for medium-done. If you use frozen lamb, defrost in the
  refrigerator overnight. 1. Combine jam, mustard, garlic, soy sauce,
  olive oil and rosemary. Reserve 2 tb of marinade for sauce. Brush
  remainder all over lamb. Season well with salt and pepper. 2.
  Marinate for 30 minutes. 3. Broil lamb for 3 minutes per side. Then
  bake lamb at 425F(220C) fat side up for 20 minutes or until just
  pink. Remove from oven and let rest on a serving dish for 10 minutes.
  Pour off any fat in pan. 4. Add red wine to pan and reduce to 1 tb.
  Add beef broth, reserved marinade and any extra lamb juices from the
  serving dish. Bring to boil and hoil for 2 minutes. 5. Slice lamb in
  thin slices against the grain. Serve with some sauce poured over.
  Serve with a Merlot wine from Ontario Canada, California USA, or St
  Emilion. A chianti is another fine match.

      Title: APRICOT UPSIDE DOWN CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Text Recipe
 
  Another of my scores this weekend was "from SOUP to DESSERT with the
  NEW Irradiated PET MILK".
  
  That's a book title believe it or not.  It's copyrighted 1934 by Pet
  Milk company.  I was naturally curious as to why they were nuking Pet
  Milk in 1934. That screwed up my historical perspective pretty good,
  but it turns out that "irradiated" refers to running the milk under
  an ultraviolet light to increase vitamin D content, not making it
  glow in the dark. So once my reality check had subsided and I paged
  through the book, I saw this which made me think of you.
  
  1. In a 9-inch skillet melt 3 tablespoons butter.
  
  2. Remove from heat and sprinkle with 1/2 cup brown sugar.
  
  3. Arrange on sugar 24 canned apricot halves.
  
  Let stand while mixing batter.
  
  4. Beat until very light 2 eggs.
  
  5. Add, while beating, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.
  
  6. Heat to boiling point:  1/4 cup Pet Milk diluted with 1/4 cup
  water and 1 Tbl shortening.
  
  7. ea Beat into egg mixture.
  
  8.  Sift together:  1 cup sifted cake flour and1 tsp baking powder.
  
  9. ea Add milk mixture beating quickly but thoroughly.
  
  10. lb over apricots.
  
  11. ea Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for 25 to 30 minutes or until
  cake shrinks from sides of pan.  Turn out while warm and serve with
  Whipped Pet Milk Topping.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  That's all pretty straight forward.  What it shows in the pictures
  but not in the text is that the cake is baked in a cast-iron skillet
  like a nice mess of cornbread.
  
  Here's the topping though I can't help but think it's a tad redundant.
  
  WHIPPED PET MILK (as a topping):
  
  Soak for 5 minutes:  1/4 tsp granulated gelatin in 1 tsp cold water.
  Scald in top of double boiler:  1/2 cup Pet Milk. Add gelatin and
  stir until dissolved. Pour into bowl and chill until icy cold. Then
  whip with rotary beater until stiff.
  
  Fold in 1 Tbl powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.
  
  Makes about 1 1/2 cups...Serves 8.
  
  NOTE:  The following flavorings may be substituted for the vanilla: 2
  t orange extract 1 t lemon extract 1/2 t almond extract and 1/2
  teaspoon lemon extract 1/2 t peppermint extract 4 dr oil of peppermint

  FROM:      Sue Bryant (Nerve Center - Source of the SPINAL_INJURY
  echo! (1:261/1000))
  
  I noticed someone in here was requesting apricot recipes and someone
  else is partial to white chocolate, so to kill two birds with one
  scone (ga ka ka ka ka) here is a delicious scone recipe from one of
  my parents' cookbooks.  They lived in England for three years, where
  scones are virtually the staff of life.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, stir together the
  flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch
  cubes and distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry
  blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in the butter until
  the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  In a small bowl, stir together
  the cream, egg, and vanilla. Add the cream mixture to the flour
  mixture and knead until combined. Knead in the white chocolate,
  walnuts, and apricots.
  
  With lightly floured hands, pat the dough out on a floured work
  surface to a thickness of 5/8 inch.  Cut circles in the dough with a
  biscuit cutter. Gather the scraps of dough together and repeat till
  all the dough is used. Bake scones on ungreased baking sheet for 15
  to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned on top.  Place baking sheet
  on wire rack for 5 minutes, then transfer scones to wire rack to
  cool. Serve warm or cool completely and store in an airtight
  container.  Makes 8 or 9 scones.
  
  * (Sue speaking) You can use those "Nestles Treasures" white chocolate
  chips, but before they came out with those, I used to use a Nestle
  Alpine White With Almonds bar, smashed into pieces. I would then omit
  the walnuts and substitute half the vanilla extract with almond
  extract for a delicious variation.
  
  ** To toast walnuts, place the walnuts in a single layer on a baking
  sheet and bake at 375 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes, shaking the sheet a
  couple of times, until the nuts are fragrant.

      1 c  Golden raisins
           Juice and grated rind of 1

      1 c  Orange juice
      2 c  Sugar
 
  I received a great little book for Christmas called "From My House To
  Yours" that has gift recipes, ideas and lots of little tid-bits. The
  following recipe is from that book. I'll include the notes the author
  wrote and will follow this message with the recipe for English Muffin
  Loaf that he makes note of. Sonya
  
  "This is delicious with toasted thin slices of English Muffin Loaf.
  Dried apricots sold in bulk are usually more flavorful than the
  prepackaged kind; natural food stores are a good source."
  
  1. Place the apricots and raisins in a bowl and add water to cover.
  Cover the bowl tightly and let it stand overnight. Drain the liquid
  into a large, heavy saucepan and chop the apricots coarsely. Add the
  apricots, raisins, lemon juice and rind, and orange juice to the pan,
  place over low heat, and bring to a simmer. Cook 20 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  2. Add the sugar and continue cooking, stirring frequently until the
  mixture of fruit is very soft and the syrup sheets when dropped from
  the side of a spoon (220 degrees on a candy thermometer), 15 to 20
  minutes. Spoon the jam into sterilized half-pint jars. Seal the jars,
  process in a boiling-water bath for 10 minutes and cool. Store in a
  cool, dark place.

    2/3 c  Apricot jam
    2/3 c  Walnuts, chopped
      2 tb Raisins
      2 tb Golden raisins
 
  Make the pastry:
  
  1. With an electric mixer on medium speed, blend the sour crem and
  butter until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and salt and
  blend until the dough comes together, about 30 seconds.
  
  2. Form the dough into 2 disks, wrap in plastic and chill overnight.
  
  3. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let soften slightly, for
  about 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, with a rack in the
  middle. Lightly grease a baking sheet.
  
  4. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each disk to a circle about
  9 to 10 inches in diameter and less than 1/8 inch thick.
  
  Prepare the Filling:
  
  5. Spread 1/3 cup apricot jam over the surface of 1 disk, leaving a
  1/4 inch border around the edges. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of the walnuts, 1
  tablespoon of the raisins and 1 tablespoon of the golden raisins over
  the jam.
  
  6. Roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion, pinching the ends together.
  Carefully lift the roll with your hands and transfer to the baking
  sheet. With a sharp knife, slice the roll halfway through into about
       12    sections.
  
  7. Repeat the procedure with the remaining dough and filling.
  
  8. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on the
  baking sheet for 5 minutes. Cut the slices through; cool completely
  on the sheet. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week or
  freeze for several months.

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/2 lb Dried apricots
           Icing sugar
           A few pistachio nuts
           -- (opt'l.)
 
  Wipe apricots with a damp cloth.  Do not soak or wash them, as this
  would make them too moist.  Mince or chop them very finely. Add a few
  tablespoons confectioners' sugar to taste, and knead thoroughly by
  hand, wetting your hands from time to time to make a smooth, soft,
  slightly moist paste. Shape into marble-sized balls. Roll them in
  confectioners' sugar and let them dry overnight.  You can insert half
  a bright green pistachio nut on top to offset the rich orange of the
  apricots.
  
  A splendid variation is stuffed apricotina.  Use 1 tb. ground almonds
  or finely chopped pistachios mixed with 1 heaping tsp. sugar. Make a
  small hole in the center of each apricotina. Put in a little of the
  filling, close the hole again, and roll in confectioners' sugar.

      Title: APRICOTS - HALVED OR SLICED
 Categories: Fruits, Canning
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 16 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
  quarts; an average of 10 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
  A bushel weighs 50 pounds and yields 20 to 25 quarts-an average of
  2-1/4 pounds per quart.
  
  Quality: Select firm, well-colored mature fruit of ideal quality for
  eating fresh.
  
  Procedure: (Optional--Dip fruit in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds
  until skins loosen. Dip quickly in cold water and slip off skins).
  Wash fruit. Cut in half, remove pits and slice if desired. To prevent
  darkening, keep peeled fruit in ascorbic acid solution. Prepare and
  boil a very light, light, or medium syrup or pack apricots in water,
  apple juice, or white grape juice. Raw packs make poor quality
  apricots.

 Categories: Fruits, Jams
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Dried apricots
      2 oz Split almonds
      3    Oranges
      2    Lemons
  2 1/2 lb Sugar
  2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  Chop the apricots roughly.  Put them into a large bowl, sprinkling
  the fine grated zest of the oranges and the cinnamon between layers.

  make 3 pints in all. Pour the liquids over the fruit and leave to
  soak overnight in a cool place.
  
  Slide the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan and simmer gently
  until the fruit is beautifully tender. Check the fruit occasionally
  as it cooks and crush it down into the pan with a potato masher. It
  may need 1-1/4 hours to become really soft.
  
  Warm the sugar.  Add it to the pan together with the juice of the
  lemons and the almonds.  Cook gently until the sugar is melted, then
  fast-boil until the saucer test shows that the preserve will set.
  Pot, tie down and label the preserve in the usual way. Makes enough
  to fill 5 jars.

        1 c  grated Pecorino
        2    eggs plus -- 2 eggs
  :          separated
        1 c  basic tomato sauce
        8 oz salted sardines, rinsed,
  :          heads removed -- and roughly
  :          ch
        2    sprigs mint
      1/4 c  flour for dusting
      1/2 c  bread crumbs for coating
  :          Olive oil for frying
  
  FOR RICE: In a 4 to 6-quart saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil
  until just smoking. Add half the chopped red onion and saffron and
  cook until softened, about 7 to 9 minutes. Add rice and chicken stock
  and bring to boil, uncovered. Cook until liquid is absorbed and rice
  is tender, about 25 minutes. Spread rice out to cool on a large
  cookie sheet, about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick. When rice is cool,
  mix with Pecorino, 2 eggs and 2 egg yolks and set aside
  
  FOR STUFFING: In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, cook remaining chopped
  onion in 2 tablespoons olive oil until light golden brown, about 10
  minutes. Add tomato sauce, chopped sardines and mint and cook 5 to 7
  minutes until reduced by one third and quite thick. Set aside and
  allow to cool.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE: Place dusting flour, egg whites and bread crumbs in
  separate shallow bowls and lightly beat egg whites. To form aracine,
  place 3 tablespoons rice mixture in palm of hand and make an
  indentation with the back of a spoon. Spoon 2 tablespoons sardine
  mixture into indentation and form an open bowl out of the rice in
  your hand. Cover filled portion with another tablespoon of rice
  mixture and using both hands, shape the rice into a ball. Continue
  with remaining rice mixture and stuffing until done.
  
  Roll each ball in flour, then egg whites, then bread crumbs and
  refrigerate 1 hour, uncovered.
  
  Heat 4 inches of cooking oil in fryer or deep frying pan to 375
  degrees. Carefully place 3 balls at a time into pan and fry until
  golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring with tongs or kitchen
  spoon to keep them moving. Drained cooked balls on paper towels and
  place on large platter and serve either warm or at room temperature.

  Sea vegetables ran be added to soups or salads, cooked alone or with
  other vegetables, and even brewed into teas. Their versatility in the
  kitchen is as wide as the ocean. When dried, the succulence and
  qualify of sea vegetables is not as apparent as when fresh, so it is
  important to choose a brand you can trust. Eden (TM) brand sea
  vegetables are the highest quality available, harvested from clean
  Northern waters.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb Middle neck of lamb, cut in
           One inch chunks
      4 lb Potatoes, peeled
     10 sm Onions, sliced
      2 oz Pearl barley
      2 pt Beef stock
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  "That's the basic recipe. You can add a load of sliced carrots and
  leeks to make it go further and about 5-6 tsps. of Worchestershire
  sauce or regular brown sauce wot you Yanks pour over everything!! If
  you like, you could add a half a pint of Guinness to your stock. I
  make my stock from the potato peelings, carrot tops, leek ends, and
  any other stuff I find lurking in the refrigerator. If you chuck in a
  few moldy lamb bones and boil/simmer for several hours, you should
  get a damned good stock (strain the liquid or you'll get God knows
  what stuck in your teeth!!) You'll need to start with about 5 pints
  of liquid. Then bung everything into a ginormous pan, bring to the
  boil, and then simmer for about two hours...should taste bloody
  orgasmic! Salt and pepper to taste, depending on your level of
  drunkeness!!"

  An Argentine asado or barbecue is not authentic without this delicious
  marinade called chimichuri. it is similar to a multi spiced
  vinaigrette and is given an earthier tone with the addition of
  saffron.
  
  I serve this with poultry or shellfish and brush it on top of garlic
  bread before toasting.
  
  Powder threads and steep in lemon juice for 20 minutes. Combine all
  ingredients with whisk and store in covered jar.

      Title: ARI'S BREAD MACHINE NOTES & BASIC BREAD RECIP
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Reference
 
  Here are my favorite tips and basic bread recipe:
  
  1.  Don't by those tiny packets of active-dry yeast. Get it in bulk
  in a health-food store.  They charge at least 10x more for those tiny
  packets -- you're paying almost entirely for the packaging. (Store
  yeast in the fridge.)  1 packet = 1 TB.
  
  2. Wheat gluten is very useful in helping the dough rise. I add
  around 1 TB per cup of non-bread flour ingredients.
  
  3. Oil is NOT necessary and actually detracts from the taste. All you
  really need for good bread is flour, salt, yeast, and water.
  Everything else is optional.
  
  4. The best breads are simply a mix of flours (whole wheat, rye, oats,
  corn, buckwheat, rice, or whatever you like). Remember thought that
  wheat flours are necessary for the gluten content, unless you add
  gluten separately.  Adding fruits and herbs and flavored liquids are
  interesting but I prefer "pure" breads. I prefer graham flour over
  regular whole wheat.
  
  5.  Each machine is different and my recipes are usually not exact --
  if the dough looks sticky and isn't forming a ball then it's too wet:
  add more flour; if it looks dry (ball doesn't have a relatively
  smooth surface, for example) add more liquid a tablespoon or two at a
  time.
  
  OK, so with all that idealism taken care of here's my basic bread
  recipe:
  
  1 TB  active dry yeast
    1 1/2    cup bread flour 1 1/2 cup graham (whole wheat) flour 1/2
  cup rye flour (use the coarse grind, preferably) 2 TB wheat gluten
  (sometime called vital wheat gluten)
        1    tsp salt 1 TB honey
    1 2/3    cup water
  
  Add ingredients in order suggested by your bread machine manual.
  
  This is intended for a 3 cup bread maker, if your machine is smaller
  just scale it accordingly. Similarly, your bread maker may suggest
  using less than 1 TB yeast.
  
  For a particularly festive bread try adding 1 TB basil 1 TB tarragon
  1 tsp rosemary chopped garlic...

      Title: ARIEL'S PEPPERCORN STEAK (OR STEAK AU POIVRE)
 Categories: Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  8 to 12 oz New York Sirloin
    1/4 c  Olive Oil
    1/4 c  Teriyaki Sauce
      2 tb Worcestershire Sauce
           Coarsely Crushed Peppercorns
           Red Wine
           Cream
           Cognac
 
  1) Combine olive oil, teriyaki and worcestershire sauces to form a
  marinade
     for the meat. Or, you may use a marinade recipe of your choice.
  Marinade
     the steak at least a few hours, or overnight in the fridge turning
  the
     meat occasionally. 2) Crush enough peppercorns to cover the steak
  on both sides. Put the
     crushed peppercorns on a cutting board and press the steak onto the
     peppercorns to coat. Do the same for both sides of the steak. 3)
  Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron with grill lines) and plop
  the
     steak into it. Depending on the meat and the marinade, you may
  have to add
     a bit of oil. 4) Cook both sides evenly until the meat is medium
  rare, or to your
     liking. 5) Put the meat on a heated plate. Keep the liquid in the
  skillet and add
     some wine to deglaze the skillet. (ie collect all the remains into
  a
     sauce). Cook (fairly high heat) until the sauce thickens, stirring
     occasionally. 6) For more sauce, or Steak au Poivre la Creme, add
  cream and cook a
     little longer. Usually you need to do this to thicken the sauce.
  7) Add cognac, cook some more. Sauce should always be thick. Pour
  sauce over
     steak and optionally flambe in cognac (Steak au Poivre Flambe).
  Serve with Parisienne potatoes and carrots.

  * Have beef chopped, not ground.
  
  1. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet. Add garlic, onions and green
  pepper. Saute until soft, about 5-7 minutes. 2. Add beef and lightly
  brown on all surfaces. Drain off some of the fat if a lot has
  accumulated. Lean beef trimmed of all fat should not have an excess
  amount, however. 3. Add remaining ingredients and simmer for 1 hour
  or slightly longer. Put a cover on skillet during cooking time, and
  slightly tilt it so steam can escape. Check often and stir to prevent
  sticking. Skim off fat as it rises. Best if allowed to sit, tightly
  covered, for an hour after cooking is complete.

      Title: ARIZONA PECAN CHOCOLATE RUM PIE
 Categories: Pies, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Lard; chilled
      3    Eggs; lightly beaten
      3 tb Water
    1/4 ts Vinegar
  1 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      3 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Dark corn syrup
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    3/4 ts Vanilla extract
      1 tb Rum
  1 1/4 c  Chopped pecans
 
  Mix the salt into the flour and cut in the lard. Measure out 1
  tablespoon of the beaten eggs into a small bowl and reserve the
  remaining eggs. Add the water and vinegar to the bowl and stir.
  Slowly add the liquid to the flour and lard, just until the mixture
  holds together to form a dough. Lightly flour a work surface and
  rolling pin and roll the dough into an 11-inch circle.  Fit it into a
  9-inch pie pan and refrigerate it if you plan to finish the pie after
  several hours, or freeze it if you are completing the recipe at this
  point. This will prevent shrinkage. Melt the chocolate and butter
  together in a heavy saucepan. Set aside and allow to cool. Stir the
  corn syrup and sugar into the reserved eggs. Add the chocolate and
  butter, vanilla, rum and the pecans. Mix well and pour into the pie
  shell. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until set. The
  filling will rise and then fall. Remove from the oven and cool on a
  rack. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

      Title: ARIZONA SUNSET CHEESECAKE
 Categories: Kooknet, Cyberealm, Cheesecake, Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Cheesecake
 
           (Shortbread Crust):
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Finely ground pecans
    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 lg Egg, separated
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
           (Cranberry Glaze Filling)
      1 cn Whole berry cranberry-
           -sauce OR 2 cups cranberry
           -orange relish
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Grated lemon zest
      1 tb Lemon juice
           (White Chocolate Filling):
  1 1/2 c  Fresh orange juice
           1-3 Inch x 1 inch piece-
           -of orange peel
           -(orange part only)
      4    8 oz pkgs cream cheese
    2/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Grated orange zest
      2 tb Cranberry Liqueur (such-
           -as Crantasia Schnapps)
      8 oz White chocolate, melted
      4    Eggs
           (Candied Oranges Topping):
      4 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
      3    Seedless oranges (unpeeled)-
           -cut into paper-thin slices
           (Garnish):
           Whipped Cream
 
  Shortbread Crust: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Working on a
  large flat surface, such as a pastry board, place flour, pecans, and
  sugar in the center of the surface and mix together. Form a small
  depression or well in the center of the mound. Add the egg yolk and
  the softened butter to the well, then blend these with the dry
  mixture. Mix the ingredients thoroughly using your hands -- there is
  no substitute for warm hands. Shape the dough into a ball and wrap in
  plastic wrap. Chill for at least 10 minutes. Roll out the dough to a
  thickness of about 1/4-inch. You should have a circle of about 11
  inches in diameter. For best results, roll out your dough between 2
  sheets of waxed paper, then peel away the paper and cut the crust in
  a 9 inch circle. Place the circle inside a 9 inch springform pan.
  Prick the crust several times with a fork to keep the crust from
  puffing up during the baking. Place the springform pan in the oven
  and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. Allow to cool.
  Using the leftover dough, line the sides of the springform pan. Press
  the dough against the sides of the pan, smoothing it so as to have a
  continuous layer of crust all the way around the sides of the pan.
  Make sure that the side crust meets the bottom crust all the way
  around. Brush the reserved egg white onto the shell, covering the
  bottom and sides. This will seal the dough and keep it from becoming
  soggy. Set aside until ready to use.
  
  Cranberry Glaze Filling: Mix the sugar and cornstarch together in a
  small saucepan. Stir in the cranberry sauce. Cook over medium heat,
  stirring constantly, until thick. Stir in the lemon zest and lemon
  juice. Set aside to cool slightly.
  
  White Chocolate Filling: Reset the oven to 350 degrees F. Boil the
  orange juice and piece of orange peel in a heavy medium saucepan
  until the juice is reduced to 3 Tbsp - about 12 minutes. Remove and
  discard the strip of orange peel and set aside the reduced orange
  juice. Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese, sugar, grated
  orange zest, Crantasia, and reduced orange juice until smooth. Beat
  in the melted white chocolate and then the eggs, one at a time,
  beating just until combined. Pour the cranberry glaze filling into
  the prepared crust, spreading evenly. Pour the white chocolate
  filling over the cranberry layer and bake about 50 minutes (the top
  will be dry and the sides puffed slightly - the center will not be
  set). Move cheesecake to a wire rack and cool completely to room
  temperature. Chill in the refrigerator overnight.
  
  Candied Oranges Topping: Cover a wire rack with waxed paper. Set
  aside. Combine the water and sugar in a heavy shallow wide skillet.
  Stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Simmer 5 minutes
  longer. Add the orange slices 1 at a time and adjust the heat so that
  the syrup bubbles only around the edges of the pan. Cook the oranges
  for one hour. Turn over the top layer of oranges and cook until the
  oranges are translucent and the orange peels tender, about another
  one hour longer. Lift and drain each orange slice out of the syrup,
  and arrange the slices in a single layer on the prepared rack. Let
  dry 1 hour. Boil the orange-sugar syrup until thick, about 6 minutes.
  
  Loosen and remove the sides of the springform pan. Set the cheesecake
  on a serving dish. Overlap the candied orange slices around the top
  of the cheesecake. Reheat the orange syrup, if necessary, and brush
  over the orange slices. Drizzle any remainder over each serving.
  Garnish: whipped cream NOTE: You may substitute grapefruits for the
  oranges in the Candied Oranges Topping if you prefer.

      Title: ARMADILLO EGGS
 Categories: Appetizers, Tex-mex, Hot
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
    1/2 lb Shredded jack cheese
    1/2 lb Shredded cheddar cheese
    1/2 lb Hot sausage (like Owens or
           .Jimmy Dean)
  1 1/2 c  Bisquick
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 pk Spicy Shake N Bake
     20    -30 jalapenos
 
  The peppers can be fresh or canned, just be sure you drain well if
  canned. You can also use the round mild cherry peppers instead.
  
  Slice the peppers in half lengthwise down one side only and scrape
  out the seeds. If you accidentally cut all the way through, just try
  to keep the two halves together. Mix Bisquick, sausage and cheddar in
  a large bowl. (Use your hands, and work those muscles!)
  
  Get your assembly line ready: the peppers, the shredded jack cheese,=
  the sausage mixture, the beaten egg in a shallow bowl, the Shake N
  Bake in a shallow bowl, and a baking rack on a cookie sheet, both
  coated with cooking spray.  Stuff each pepper with shredded jack,
  then stick the halves back together, if separated. Grab a handful of
  the sausage goo and wrap around the pepper in the shape of an
  elongated egg. Dip in beaten egg= and roll in Shake N Bake to coat
  evenly. Place on baking rack. When the peppers are all ready, bake at
  350 for 25 minutes or till crisp.= NOTES: You can put the peppers
  straight on the baking sheet instead of on a rack, but they wind up
  flat on one side. Hey, they still taste just as good, though. Also,
  don't be stingy with the sausage mixture. Be sure you cover the
  entire pepper, or cheese could explode out the side while baking.
  And, a final thought: I've heard it said that you can stuff the
  peppers with cream cheese instead of shredded jack. I tried that
  ONCE, and all I can say is that it takes more manual dexterity and
  WAY more patience than I have. And I really didn't think the results
  were worth it. But whatever way you decide to go, good luck.
  
  (I tried cream cheese in both fresh and canned peppers and had good
  results -- in fact the cream cheese didn't melt and run out like the
  jack cheese did. Which reminds me -- after about 10 minutes in the
  oven the cheese begins to melt and run.  When that happens remove
  the= rack from the oven and turn the "leakers" up so that the cheese
  doesn't all run out, then return the rack to the oven for the
  duration of the cooking time. -- -- Bill.)

      Title: ARNAKI SE FILLO (LAMB IN FILLO)
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Lamb
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      6    Boneless lamb leg steaks *
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Butter or oil
      2 md Onions; sliced
      1    Garlic clove
     12    Fillo sheets
    1/2 c  Butter; melted
           Salt
      3 md Tomatoes; peeled
      1 ts Rigani or oregano
    125 g  Feta cheese; cut in 6 slices
 
  *Note: Lamb steaks should be about 2 cm (3/4 inch) thick.
  
  Serves: 6 Oven temperature: 200 C (400 F) Cooking time: 25-30 minutes
  
  Trim steaks of most of the fat and shape neatly - trimmings can be
  used in a ground lamb dish.  Season with pepper.
  
  Heat butter or oil in a frying pan and brown steaks quickly on each
  side - do not cook through.  Lift out onto a dish and leave until
  cool. Add onions to pan and fry gently until transparent, add garlic
  and remove from heat.
  
  Brush a sheet of fillo pastry with melted butter and place another
  sheet on top, brushing again with butter. Fold in half to make almost
  a square of fillo.  Put aside and cover wtih a dry tea towel, then
  one dampened with warm water.  Repeat with remaining fillo to give 6
  prepared squares. Take one square and brush top with butter - leave
  remaining pastry covered. Place a lamb steak in the centre and season
  lightly with salt. Top with onion-garlic mixture and cover with 2
  slices of tomato. Sprinkle with a little rigani, salt and pepper and
  place a slice of feta cheese on top. Bring up ends of fillo pastry
  and double-fold over top. Fold in ends as you would a package then
  tuck ends underneath. This is known as a the chemist's (druggist's)
  fold.  Place on a buttered baking tray. Repeat with remaining
  ingredients.
  
  Brush tops and sides of packages lightly with melted butter and bake
  in a preheated hot oven for 15 minutes. Serve immediately if
  possible, though they will survive in the oven with heat turned off
  for about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley sprigs and serve with
  boiled green beans or zucchini dressed with olive and lemon juice.
  
  Note:  Medallions of lamb cut from a trimmed loin can be used instead
  of the steaks.  You will require 12, and place 2 in each package.

  together in another bowl, place the liver in a sieve and shake
  through all the excess flour.  In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, heat
  the oil over high heat until a light haze forms above it. Add the
  liver and stir it about in the hot oil for 1 or 2 minutes, or until
  the cubes are lightly browned. Stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of
  salt and a few grindings of pepper. With a slotted spoon, transfer
  the liver to paper towels to drain.
    Mound the liver in the center of a heated platter, arrange the
  onion-ring mixture and red pepper strips around it and serve at once.

      Title: ARNI EXOHIKO ("SURPRISE" LAMB~ COUNTRY STYLE
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Lamb
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      2 tb Olive oil
      8    Loin lamb chops
     18    Sheets commercial phyllo
      6 tb Butter; hot and melted
      2 c  Peas; cooked and drained
     16    Potato balls; parboiled
     16    Cherry tomatoes; peeled
    1/2 lb Kasseri cheese; in 8 pieces
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    3/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 pn Dried oregano
 
  *Note: 3/4-inch slices leg of lamb may be used instead of lamb chops.
  
  In a heavy skillet, heat the oil or butter and fry the lamb over high
  heat, turning frequently.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes,
  then remove from the heat. Meanwhile, unroll the filo sheets and
  cover with a damp towel.  In a small pan over low heat, have the
  butter hot without letting it brown. Remove two sheets of filo, brush
  with hot butter over the first, then cover with the second sheet and
  brush it with butter. In the center of the buttered filo place 1 lamb
  chop, 2 tablspoons peas, 2 potato balls, 2 cherry tomatoes, and a
  slice of kasseri. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, a heaping tablespoon
  of parsley, and a pinch of oregano. Fold the filo around the lamb and
  vegetables like a sealed parcel. Place, seam side down, on a buttered
  baking pan (approximately 11 x 15 x 3 inches) and set aside while you
  repeat the procedure with the remaining ingredients to make 8
  "parcels".  Brush hot butter on the tops, then bake in a moderate
  oven (350 F) for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden in color. Remove
  from the oven and arrange on a warm platter or on individual dishes.
  Serve warm, with a fresh-cooked or raw vegetable salad.
  
  Note: The vegetables and herbs may be varied. Substitute green beans
  or lima beans for peas, use thyme or basil instead of oregano. Arni
  Exohiko is frequently prepared using buttered waxed paper, parchment
  paper or aluminum foil rather than with filo.

      Title: ARNI LEMONATO (LEMON LAMB)
 Categories: Greek, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Simple ethnic recipes, unchanged for generations, often have an
  authority that the latest food fashions cannot begin to match. The
  following Greek lemon lamb dish is a case in point. Faithful to its
  frugal origins. this recipe works equally well with cheap cuts like
  lamb shanks. breast of lamb or best end of neck. If you do use these
  fattier meals, make the dish a day ahead, refrigerate it and remove
  the fat that coagulates on top. if anything, the dish gains added
  depth of flavour when made ahead and reheated.
  
  Trim skin and ail excess fat from a boned shoulder or leg of lamb.
  Squeeze enough lemons to provide 1/3 cup of juice. Open out the meat
  and rub both inside and outside surfaces with some of the lemon juice
  and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.  On the inside surface of the
  meat, sprinkle a teaspoon of dried oregano or 1/2 a tablespoon of
  chopped fresh oregano. Roll the meat up and tie securely.
  
  Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pot large enough to take the roll
  comfortably and brown the meat on all sides. Turn the heat down to
  low and add to the pot the rest of the lemon juice, 2 cloves of
  garlic, crushed, and another teaspoon of dried oregano or 1/2
  tablespoon of fresh.
  
  Cover the pot and simmer very gently, turning occasionally, for about
  2 1/2 hours, till very tender. If you like, add small new potatoes to
  the pot about an hour before serving.
  
  To serve, remove the string and slice the meat into the centre of a
  heated serving platter.  Surround with potatoes and pour lemony
  juices over the meat.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: ARNI SOUVLAKI
 Categories: Other meat
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           NANCY BERRY
      1    Leg lamb;about 4 lb. --
           Boned
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Juice of 1 lemon
      2 ts Dried oregano
     20 ml Garlic -- crushed or
           Chopped
      3    Bay leaves -- broken in
           Pieces
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper to taste
           (CWBJ78A)
 
  Cut lamb into 1 1/2 inch cubes and place in a non-reactive (glass or
  earthenware) dish. Add remaining ingredients to lamb, mix well to coat
  meat, and cover. You can also place all ingredients in a heavy
  plastic bag and seal. Leave in refrigerator to marinate for 12-24
  hours, stirring meat occasionally. Lift lamb out of marinade and
  thread onto metal skewers. Pieces of bay leaf may be placed between
  lamb cubes. Since most vegetables have different cooking times, I
  would suggest that you skewer peppers, onions, etc. separately and
  serve them together with the lamb. If you wish these may be marinated
  also (in a separate bag.) Cook under a hot broiler or over glowing
  charcoal, turning and basting frequently with marinade. I like this
  best medium rare. Keep checking the meat -- the cooking time will

      Title: AROMATIC DUCK
 Categories: Poultry, Chinese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Duckling
      2 ts Peppercorns
      1 ts Thyme, whole dried
      2    Bay leaf; crumbled
      6    Cloves
      1 tb Kosher salt
      1 tb Sugar, brown
      1 tb Brandy
      1    Garlic clove
      5    Red cabbage leaves
 
  Cut off the wingtips from the duck and wrap them up with the giblets
  for making stock.  Pull out and discard any loose interior fat. Rinse
  the duck inside and out and pat dry, inside and out. Mix together in
  a spice mill or mortar the peppercorns, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and
  salt. Grind to a fine texture. Combine in a small dish with the brown
  sugar and brandy. Place the duck in a heavy plastic bag that fits
  snugly. Rub half the spice mixture inside the duck and the remaining
  half over the outside. Place the garlic in the duck's cavity. Close
  the bag tightly and refrigerate 24 hours, rubbing the surface and
  squeezing in the spices occasionally. Remove the duck from the bag
  and gently pat it dry. Set it on a cake rack over a plate and return
  it, uncovered, to the refrigerator for another 24 hours or so,
  turning it once. Pat the duck to dry it thoroughly (if not already
  dry) and let it come to room temperature (at least two hours).
  Preheat the oven to 300. Using a large needle and white cotton
  thread, sew closed the neck and tail openings.  Place the duck on its
  side on a rack set in a roasting pan. Roast the duck for 45 minutes.
  With the needle, prick the fatty parts on the upper side; do not
  prick deeply enough to pierce the flesh. Grab the duck by the legs
  and turn it over onto the other side. Increase the oven temperature
  to 350 and roast 30 minutes. Price the fatty parts on the upturned
  side and then turn the duck onto its breast. Increase the heat to 400
  and roast about 30 minutes longer, or until the duck is deeply
  browned and most of the fat has melted away. Remove from the oven and
  let cool 1 to 3 hours before serving. To serve: Using a heavy cleaver
  or poultry shears, cut through flesh and bone of the duck carefully
  to make about 12 to 14 serving pieces, keeping the skin neatly intact
  on each piece. Spread the cabbage leaves over a platter, shallow
  basket or wooden bowl and arrange the duck on them. If the duck is to
  be served hot, arrange the cut pieces in a pan in a single layer, cut
  side down, and roast in a preheated 350 oven 15 minutes.

      Title: AROMATIC LAMB
 Categories: Lamb, Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Leg of lamb (about 4 lbs)
      3 lb Potatoes (about 5 oz each)
      1    Lemon (may be doubled)
           Honey
           Olive oil
           Butter
           Rosemary, thyme & oregano
 
  Put the leg of lamb into a large roasting pan.  Bruise the leaves of
  2 or 3 sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle them over the meat. Add plenty
  of pepper and 1 tablespoon honey. Rub the mixture into the meat with
  your hands. Then rub half a lemon over the joint, squeezing the juice
  on to the meat as you do so.  Do not add any salt. Leave to marinate
  for 4 to 24 hours.
      Peel and quarter the potatoes, then arrange them in a single layer
  round the lamb.  Squeeze lemon juice over the potatoes -- use at
  least half a lemon, or up to one and a half lemons for a strong
  citrus flavour. Carefully pour 1/4 pint water into a corner of the
  roasting pan, then sprinkle over the potatoes and lamb about 2
  tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary, at least 1 teaspoon each fresh
  chopped thyme and oregano, and some salt and pepper.  Drizzle on
  1-1/2 teaspoons honey and 1 tablespoon olive oil, then dot with 1 oz
  butter. Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 6 for a further 1 to 1-1/4
  hours. The ingredients will become gilded and will burnish to a rich
  brown in places. Lift the meat and turn the potatoes occasionally,
  and if necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan to prevent
  drying out.

      1 sm Onion; chopped

    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Cumin
    1/4 ts Thyme
      1 pn Saffron; toasted
      1 lb Shrimp, raw
           - shelled, deveined
      1 c  -Hot water
    1/4 c  Dry white wine
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Hot sauce
      2 c  Long grain white rice
  2 1/2 c  -Water
    1/2 c  Beer
           Cooked peas
           Pimiento strips
           Parsley bouquets
 
  Use a 3-quart casserole with lid.  An earthenware casserole is
  preferable, especially if you wish to add a touch of Spain to a
  dinner party. However, I know that good earthenware is hard to find
  today. I have 2 casseroles that I've had for 15 years. Heat oil in
  casserole. Saute onion and pepper until transparent. Add garlic,
  parsley, tomato, bay leaf, nutmeg, cumin and thyme.  Mix well, cover,
  and cook over low heat until mushy (about 15 minutes).  The saffron
  should be toasting on the lid in the little brown paper. Add the
  shrimp to the saute and cook until it turns pink. Dissolve the
  saffron in the 1 cup hot water.  Combine with wine, lemon juice, salt
  and hot sauce.  Pour into casserole, stir to mix, and cook covered 10
  minutes more. Now add the rice and the 2 1/2 cups of water.
  Distribute ingredients well in casserole.  Bring to a quick boil,
  STIR ONCE, and place in preheated 325 degree F. oven for only 20
  minutes - NI UN MINUTO MAS! Remove from oven, uncover, and garnish
  with peas, pimientos, and parsley. Pour beer over all.  Cover again
  and allow to stand 15 minutes longer, before serving.

      1 c  Fresh corn kernels or 1/3
           -cup carrot rounds
           Plus 1/2 cup fresh peas
           -(optional)
      1    Parsley sprig
      2    Whole chilies serranos
           Sea salt to taste
           White Rice
 
  Put the rice into a bowl and cover with very hot water. Stir once and
  leave to soak for 10 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water, and drain
  again.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pan.  Give the rice a final shake and stir
  into the fat.  Fry over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring
  almost continuously.  Add the onion and garlic and continue frying
  until the rice is just turning a pale gold and the onion is
  transparent - about 3 to 5 minutes longer.
  
  Pour in the broth and, if used, the vegetables and parsley or fresh
  chilies, add salt to taste, stir once again for the last time, and
  cook over fairly high heat, uncovered, until all the broth has been
  absorbed and air holes appear in the surface. Cover the surface of
  the rice with a towel and lid and continue cooking over very low heat
  for 5 minutes more. Remove from the heat and set aside in a warm
  place for the rice to absorb the rest of the moisture in the steam
  and swell ~ about 15 minutes. Dig gently to the bottom and test a
  grain of rice. If it is still damp, cook for a few minutes longer.
  If the top grains are not quite soft, then sprinkle with a little
  more hot broth, cover, and cook for a few minutes longer.
  
  Before serving, turn the rice over from the bottom so that the
  flavored juices will be distributed evenly.

 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Onion
           - peeled and thinly sliced
      4 tb Olive oil
      1    Steak dried salt cod
      1    Ripe tomato (or dbl. amt.)
           - peeled, cored
           - and very coarsely chopped
           Salt and pepper to taste
  1 2/3 c  Short-grain rice
 
  Short-grain rice adds the perfect texture to this traditional dish
  from northern Portugal. The salt cod may eliminate the need for
  additional salt.
  
  BROWN THE ONION in the olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over
  moderate heat. Meanwhile, shred the cod, remove the skin and bones
  and wash but do not soak. Add the cod to the onion, cover and simmer
  for about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and leave to cook 20-to-30
  minutes, covered, over low heat. Meanwhile, wash and drain the rice.
  Add 3 1/3 cups water to the pan (add twice as much water as there is
  rice), season to taste with salt and pepper. When the water boils,
  add the rice and continue to cook on low heat until the rice is
  done--probably 25-to-30 minutes. Cover the kettle for the last half
  of cooking.

      1    Text Onl
 
  This, too, is a Portuguese recipe++from the Algarve.
  
  It can be made with octopuses of any size.  Baby ones won't need so
  much precooking.
  
  Precook 600 to 800 g octopus in 200 mL red wine with a little water.
  
  The octopus will exude liquid so that you are likely to end up with
  more cooking liquid at the end.
  
  Retain this and add water to make it up to 600 ea mL. Cut the drained
  octopus into small pieces.
  
  Heat 150 mL olive oil in a large saucepan, add a chopped onion and
  cook gently, stirring, for 2 or 3 minutes. Add 2 garlic cloves finely
  chopped, 3 tomatoes, skinned and chopped, and a large green pepper
  cut into snips. Season with salt, pepper and chilli powder to taste.
  Cook for a few minutes longer.
  
  Add the cooking liquid from the octopus and bring it to the boil. Add
  350 g rice (preferable a short-grain risotto rice like arborio) and
  bring back to the boil, then turn the heat very low and put the lid
  on the saucepan. After 15 minutes, stir to ensure the rice is not
  catching on the bottom of the saucepan.  In 5 minutes more, taste a
  grain or two to make sure it is soft.  The rice should still be quite
  damp.
  
  Serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  water; drain again and set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pan, stir the rice into it, and fry over
  fairly high heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, for
  about 5 minutes.  Add the onion and chile strips and continue frying
  for 4 minutes or until the onion is translucent.
  
  Meanwhile, put 1 cup of the broth into a blender jar; add the garlic,
  parsley, and epazote and blend until smooth. Add this to the frying
  rice and continue frying and reducing the puree over quite high heat,
  stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the rice is dry.
  Stir in the rest of the broth, add salt to taste, and cook over
  fairly high heat, uncovered, until the liquid has been absorbed and
  there are air holes in the rice. Cover with a towel and lid and
  continue cooking over low heat for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat
  and set aside, still covered, in a warm place for the rice to swell
  up.  Before serving, turn the rice over with a fork from the bottom
  where a lot of the flavor and oil will have settled.

    Roast the chilies or peppers, remove their skins, stems, seeds and
  thick white membranes and discard. Chop the chilies into chunks.
  Combine 1 cup of the chunks and 1/2 cup of stock in the jar of a
  blender and blend at high speed for 15 seconds.  Then gradually add
  the remaining chilies and the parsley, onions, garlic, salt and
  pepper, blending until the mixture is reduced to a smooth puree.  (To
  make the sauce by hand, puree the chilies, parsley, onions and
  garlic, a cup or so at a time, in a food mill set over a bowl.
  Discard any pulp left in the mill. Stir in 1/2 cup of stock and the
  salt and pepper.)
    Pour the oil into a 2 to 3 quart casserole and set it over moderate
  heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the rice and stir
  constantly for 2 to 3 minutes until the grains are coated with oil.
  Do not let them brown. Now add the pureed chili mixture and simmer,
  stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the remaining
  3 1/2 cups of stock to a boil in a small saucepan and pour it over
  the rice. Return to a boil, cover the casserole and reduce the heat
  to its lowest point. Simmer undisturbed for 18 to 20 minutes, or
  until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid.  Before
  serving, fluff the rice with a fork. If the rice must wait, remove
  the cover and drape the pan loosely with a towel. Place in a
  preheated 250 degree (F) oven to keep warm.

           Sea salt to taste
           Green Rice
 
  Put the rice into a bowl and pour very hot water over to cover; stir
  and set aside for 10 minutes.  Drain in a strainer and rinse in cold
  water; drain again and set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pan, stir the rice into it, and fry over
  fairly high heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, for
  about 5 minutes.  Add the onion and chile strips and continue frying
  for 4 minutes or until the onion is translucent.
  
  Meanwhile, put 1 cup of the broth into a blender jar; add the garlic,
  parsley, and epazote and blend until smooth. Add this to the frying
  rice and continue frying and reducing the puree over quite high heat,
  stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the rice is dry.
  Stir in the rest of the broth, add salt to taste, and cook over
  fairly high heat, uncovered, until the liquid has been absorbed and
  there are air holes in the rice. Cover with a towel and lid and
  continue cooking over low heat for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat
  and set aside, still covered, in a warm place for the rice to swell
  up.  Before serving, turn the rice over with a fork from the bottom
  where a lot of the flavor and oil will have settled.

  control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and push Start.  In hot
  and humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.  Since the flavor of this
  loaf is not too assertive, but the texture is substantial, it is a

      Title: ARTICHOKE & LEEK PIZZA (EW)
 Categories: Main dish, Pizzas
      Yield: 1 Pizza
 
      2 md Sized artichokes or 4 small
    1/2    Lemon for preparing
           -artichokes
      1 oz Pancetta, diced
      1 tb Olive oil preferably extra
           Virgin
      1    Onion, finely chopped
           Salt & freshly ground black
           -pepper, to taste
      1    Large leek, thoroughly
           -claned and sliced thinly
    3/4 lb Pizza Dough
           Semolina or cornmeal for
           -dusting
      2 oz Mozzarella cheese, coarsely
           -grated (2/3 cup)
      3 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
 
  Place a pizza stone, baking tiles or an inverted baking sheet on the
  lowest rack of a cold oven; preheat for 30 minutes to 500 degrees F
  or the highest setting.
  
  For each of the artichokes, peel away and discard the tough outer
  leaves, snapping them off at the base, until you reach the pale
  yellow leaves with the darker green tops. Slice off the darkest green
  top and rub the artichoke with the cut side of the lemon half.
   With a paring knife, trim the artichoke where you snapped off the
  leaves, removing any green portions. Rub with lemon. Trim the bottom
  1/4 inch off the stem and pare away the tough outer skin. With a
  melon baller or paring knife, remove the fuzzy choke from the center
  of the artichoke. Cut the heart into quarters, then cut each quarter
  into 4 pieces. Squeeze the lemon into a bowl of water and place the
  artichoke pieces into the acidulated water to keep them from turning
  brown.
  
  Heat a skillet over the medium heat, add pacetta and cook, stirring
  until golden about 4 minutes.  Drain the pancetta on paper towels.
  Pour off fat from the skillet. Add 1 1/2 tsp. of the olive oil and
  onions to the skillet.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions
  are soft but not brown, about 3 minutes. Add the drained artichoke
  pieces and stir to mix well. Add pepper and 2/3 cup water. Cover and
  cook over low heat until the artichoke pieces are tender and most of
  the liquid has cooked away, about 15 minutes.  Add leeks and stir to
  mix well. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding salt if desired. Let
  cool completely.
  
  Here we go with the dough again...Place dough on a lightly floured
  surface and pat into a disk.  Use a rolling pin or your hands to roll
  or stretch the dough into a circle that is 1/4 inch thick and 10 to
  12 inches in diameter.  Transfer to a semolina or cornmeal dusted
  pizza peel or inverted baking sheet. Brush the dough with a little of
  the remaining olive oil. Distribute the artichoke mixture over the
  dough. Sprinkle the cheeses over the artichoke mixture. Drizzle with
  the remaining olive oil.
  
  Carefully slide the pizza onto the heated pizza stone and bake for 6
  to 8 minutes, or until the bottom is crisp and browned and the top is
  bubbling.

       15    peppercorns -- coarsely
  :          ground in
  :          mortar
      1/2 c  parsley -- finely chopped

  top two thirds of the greens. Trim the outsides, cut the artichokes
  into quarters, and immediately put them in a bowl with cold water to
  cover and the lemon juice. Remove the choke from each piece with a
  knife; then thinly slice each quarter into 3 or 4 pieces and return
  them to the water. Just before cooking, remove the pieces from the
  water and blot them dry with a towel.

  the garlic. When the garlic colors, remove it and then add the drained
  artichokes. Give pan a shake right away to coat the pieces with oil,
  then season with salt and pepper and add about 2 tablespoons of the
  parsley. Saute' until the artichokes browned and thoroughly cooked.

  parsley, cheese, and the cooked artichokes. Wipe out the pan, add
  enough of the remaining oil just to coat the bottom, and pour in the
  eggs. Give the pan a shake to loosen the eggs, then lower the heat.

  plate, then turn it back into the pan, with the opposite side down,
  and continue to cook until it is also nicely colored. Serve warm or
  at room temperature, sliced into wedges.

  served warm. or, to make it easier on the cook, ahead of time and
  served at room temperature The artichokes are first fried in olive
  oil with pepper and parsley and then cooked with the eggs. Use a
  nonstick or seasoned frying pan to keep eggs from sticking. Makes 1
  frittata, serving 4 to 6

 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ts Whole fennel seeds
      1 ts Whole black peppercorns
      2 ts Whole coriander seeds
      2    Whole bay leaves
      4    Garlic cloves; peeled,
           -- and lightly mashed
      3 tb Lemon juice; plus...
      1    Whole lemon
    1/2 c  Olive oil
  1 1/2 ts Salt; or to taste
    1/4 ts Sugar
      1    Boiling potato (about 8 oz.)
      1 sm Onion
 
  Tie up the fennel, peppercorns, coriander seeds, bay leaves, and
  garlic in a cheesecloth bundle and drop into a 2-1/2 quart pot. Add 2
  cups water and bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer 20
  minutes. Turn off the heat and remove the cheesecloth bundle,
  squeezing out as much liquid as possible.  Add the lemon juice, olive
  oil, salt, and sugar. Mix and set aside.
  
  Halve the lemon.  Cut off the long artichoke stems, if there are any.
  1. Starting near the stem end, press back the artichoke leaves, one
  by one, and then snap them off. Keep doing this until you have gone
  past the bowl part of the artichoke that harbors the heat and have
  reached the paler inner leaves.  Using a sharp knife (a serrated one
  is particularly good), cut off the remaining leafy area and discard
  it. Immediately rub all cut sections with a lemon half. 2. Scoop away
  the "choke" in the center of the artichoke with a grapefruit spoon.
  Squeeze a little lemon juice into this area and rub it in. 3. Using a
  sharp paring knife, trim the outside of the artichoke bowl so there
  are no more dark green sections left and the bowl gets a smooth
  appearance. Rub these newly cut sections with lemon. Cut each
  artichoke heart into four, again rubbing cut sections with lemon. Cut
  and prepare the remaining artichokes the same way.
  
  Peel the potato and cut into sections that seem roughly the same size
  as the pieces of artichoke heart.
  
  Peel the onion and cut it into eight sections.
  
  Put the artichoke hearts, potatoes, and onion into prepared liquid and
  bring to a boil.  Cover, lower heat and simmer for about 12 minutes.
  Remove a piece of potato and a piece of artichoke. Cut off sections
  of each and taste for doneness and balance of salt and lemon. You may
  add more of either seasoning at this time if you wish. Cover and
  simmer another 3 to 7 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Uncover
  and cool the vegetables in the liquid.  You may refrigerate the
  contents of the pot if you wish.
  
  When serving, remove the cool (or cold) vegetables with a slotted
  spoon. Do not serve the liquid.

  the "choke" in the center of the artichoke with a grapefruit spoon.
  Squeeze a little lemon juice into this area and rub it in. 3. Using a
  sharp paring knife, trim the outside of the artichoke bowl so there
  are no more dark green sections left and the bowl gets a smooth
  appearance. Rub these newly cut sections with lemon. Cut each
  artichoke heart into four, again rubbing cut sections with lemon. Cut
  and prepare the remaining artichokes the same way.
  
  Peel the potato and cut into sections that seem roughly the same size
  as the pieces of artichoke heart.
  
  Peel the onion and cut it into eight sections.
  
  Put the artichoke hearts, potatoes, and onion into prepared liquid and
  bring to a boil.  Cover, lower heat and simmer for about 12 minutes.
  Remove a piece of potato and a piece of artichoke. Cut off sections
  of each and taste for doneness and balance of salt and lemon. You may
  add more of either seasoning at this time if you wish. Cover and
  simmer another 3 to 7 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Uncover
  and cool the vegetables in the liquid.  You may refrigerate the
  contents of the pot if you wish.
  
  When serving, remove the cool (or cold) vegetables with a slotted
  spoon. Do not serve the liquid.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  The Aussie recipes I've been posting are from "Raw Materials", a
  column written by Meryl Constance for the Sydney Morning Herald. In
  each column she zeros in on a particular foodstuff, tells a bit about
  its uses and history and then presents recipes utilizing it. Nice
  format. Since I really like the style and content of the food
  sections that Mark sent over I'm posting her whole column on
  artichokes rather than just the recipes so folks here can get a feel
  for it. Here's the introductory material. The recipes follow in the
  next three posts.
  
  Globe artichokes are among the most beautiful of vegetables - witness
  their frequent appearance in still-life paintings. And for fineness
  of flavour and texture, they rank alongside that other luxury
  vegetable, asparagus.
  
  Yet fresh artichokes are greatly underused in this country and many
  people are only acquainted with the inferior tinned version, which is
  about as much like the real thing as tinned asparagus is like fresh.
  Globe artichokes are in season now and well worth seeking out.
  
  Besides their culinary virtues, they have health-food status, being
  low in kilojoules (about 90 kJ per I 00 g) and a source of various
  vitamins and minerals.
  
  At present, they cost about 60c to 80c each, though Raw Materials
  recently saw some magnificently fat specimens for $2 each in
  Leichhardt, where the Italian community knows how to appreciate them.
  They are said to have originated in Sicily and certainly they were
  developed into their modern form by Italian growers.
  
  Botanically, globe artichokes are thistle buds. Choose tightly furled
  artichokes which are as fat as possible. They will keep for a few
  days in the fridge, lightly wrapped in plastic, and even better if
  their stems are in water.  Before use, they should be soaked upside
  down in a sinkful of water to remove any dirt or insect residents.
  
  Australians' underuse of artichokes probably has a lot to do with
  lack of knowledge about how to deal with them and a vague idea that
  it is a complex matter with traps for the unwary.
  
  The trap, of course, is the aptly-named choke, a hairy inedible
  portion lurking at the heart of the vegetable, at the centre of the
  leaves and on top of the succulent base. Provided you know not to try
  eating it, it's no problem.
  
  Another daunting factor is the instruction, given in so many recipe
  books, to snip off the top third of each leaf - fiddly and
  unnecessary (unless you chance across the rare spinella variety,
  which is cone-shaped and has a little thorn at the tip of each leaf).
  
  When artichokes are served whole, plainly boiled and with a dipping
  sauce, as an entree, there is no need to trim the leaves at all. In
  fact, to do so dims their beauty as an object on the plate. The diner
  pulls away each leaf by the tip, dips the base in the sauce and draws
  the base of the leaf through the teeth to scrape off the meaty flesh
  there. Used leaves are piled to one side until all have been
  detached.  Then it is just a matter of removing the choke with a
  spoon or knife, before enjoying the best part of all, the base. The
  whole process is a little ritual.
  
  But many artichoke recipes are less reverent and are designed to let
  the diner eat the whole vegetable with no mucking about.
  
  For these, it's just a matter of slicing off the whole top of the
  vegetable, leaving between a half and two thirds. Discard a couple of
  layers of the tough outside leaves and tidy up the base (leave as
  much as you can).  If the artichokes are to be halved or quartered,
  it is easy to see and remove the choke.  If they are to be served
  whole, pull and cut out the innermost leaves and open out the centre
  so that you can scrape out the fibrous white choke with a teaspoon.
  
  Cut surfaces of an artichoke blacken very quickly, so immediately rub
  them with a lemon and drop the artichoke pieces into water acidulated
  with lemon juice (or vinegar at a pinch) until you are ready to deal
  with them. Don't cook them in aluminium or they will go black
  immediately.

      Title: ARTICHOKE KHORESH
 Categories: Artichokes, Chicken, Persian, Stew
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
    1 1/2 lb chicken legs, skinless --
  :          cut up and defatted
        2 TB olive oil
        2 md onions -- peel thinly slice
        1 ts salt
      1/4 ts freshly ground black pepper
      1/2 ts ground saffron -- dissolved
  :          in
        2 TB hot water
      1/4 ts turmeric
        3 c  chopped fresh parsley
      1/2 c  chopped fresh mint
        5 TB fresh lime juice
        1 lb fresh artichoke hearts
  
  STEP #1 - Heat a non-stick saute pan and lightly brown chicken. Add 1
  tablespoon oil and the onion. Fry over medium heat, stirring
  occasionally, for 20 minutes or until onion becomes translucent. Add
  salt, pepper, saffron water, and turmeric. Pour in 1 1/2 cups water.
  Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  STEP #2 - In a non-stick skillet, fry the parsley and mint in 1
  tablespoon oil over medium heat for 10 minutes and add to the chicken.
  
  STEP #3 - Add lime juice and the artichoke hearts to the chicken.
  Cover and simmer for 40 to 55 minutes over low heat.
  
  STEP #4 - Check to see if the artichoke hearts are tender. Taste the
  khoresh and adjust seasoning. Transfer it to a deep casserole. Cover
  and place in a warm oven until ready to serve.
  
  STEP #5 - Serve hot from the same dish with steamed basmati; cook it
  very slowly with a very tight fitting lid. Add salt to water to help
  rice withstand a longer cooking time.
  
  Nush-e jan! (Enjoy this food of life.)
  
  VARIATIONS:  For *ab ghureh* substitute 3/4 cup unripe grape juice
  for the lime juice. Frozen (2 9-oz pkgs) or bottled artichokes may be
  substituted. Drain well. If pre-cooked, adjust cooking time, adding
  artichoke hearts when appropriate to step 3. Chicken can be replaced
  with 1 pound lean stew meat such as lamb, veal or beef, cut into 1
  inch cubes. In step 1, increase water to 2-1/2 cups; and simmer for
  55 minutes insteadof 30 minutes.

      Title: ARTICHOKE OYSTER SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 tb Butter, melted
    1/2 c  Shallots (chopped fine)
    1/4 ts Thyme
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Flour
     14 oz Chicken broth
           -(more or less won't hurt)
      4 c  Oysters, drained; reserve
           -liquid (less, to taste)
     14 oz Artichoke hearts, cooked
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Tabasco
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      3 tb Parsley (chopped, fresh)
 
  In a 3-quart casserole, melt butter and saute shallots. When shallots
  are translucent, add thyme, bay leaf and cayenne pepper. Add flour
  and whisk well.  Add broth, oyster water, artichoke hearts, salt and
  tabasco. Bring to a boil. Add oysters and parsley. Simmer on medium,
  partly covered, for exactly 5 minutes. Add whipped cream and serve
  immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken broth with artichokes and poached oysters ~- This is a
  modern cajun-style recipe that I adapted from a local
  convenience-food cookbook by Jean Durkee. It's an intriguing
  combination of modern American ingredients with traditional cajun
  flavorings.
  
  *  Fresh parsley tastes much better than dried parsley. If the
  oysters are bigger than a small bite-size, cut them up before adding
  them to the soup. Use the smallest oysters you can find.
  
  *  When I'm not making a double recipe, I usually dump the entire
  (about 1-cup) container of whipping cream into the soup, even though
  that's double what the recipe calls form.
  
  *  The timing on cooking the oysters is fairly critical. If you
  overcook them, they will be rubbery.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

     10 c  Canned low-salt chicken
           -broth
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      1    Bay leaf

MMMMM----------------------------STEW---------------------------------
     12 sm Red-skinned potatoes
      1 tb Salt
      1    Bay leaf
  1 1/4 ts Mustard seeds
    1/2 ts Celery seeds
      1 ts (packed) stemmed saffron
     18    Mussels, scrubbed,debearded
    3/4 c  Chopped shallots
      5 tb Unsalted butter
      2    Green onions, finely chopped
      1 bn Chives, chopped
 
  Artichokes: Squeeze juice from 2 lemon halves into a large bowl; add
  lemon halves. Fill bowl with water.
  
  To prepare an artichoke for cooking, first cut off the stem. Starting
  at the base of the artichoke, bend the tough dark green outer leaves
  back and snap them off where they break naturally: continue until all
  of the outer leaves have been removed, leaving a cone of tender pale
  green leaves. Using a small sharp knife, trim the outside edge of the
  base of the artichoke until it is smooth. Rub the trimmed edge with 1
  of the remaining lemon halves. Cut artichoke lengthwise into
  quarters. Rub the cut sides of these quarters with lemon to prevent
  any discoloration. Using the small knife, carefully cut out the hairy
  choke and the spiky purple-tipped leaves from each artichoke quarter.
  Rub each cut area with lemon. Trim the tougher leaf tops from each
  quarter so that all that remains is the choicest, most tender portion
  of the artichoke. Cut quarter into two wedges. Places wedges into the
  lemon water. Repeat with the remaining artichokes.
  
  Bring the chicken broth, olive oil and bay leaf to a boil in a heavy
  large pot (do not use aluminum or cast iron). Drain artichokes; add
  to pot. Return to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until
  artichokes are tender, about 20 minutes. Using slotted spoon,
  transfer artichokes to medium bowl. Reserve 1 cup cooking liquid in
  small bowl.
  
  Stew: Place potatoes, salt, bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds and
  celery seeds in large saucepan. Pour in enough cold water to cover
  potatoes generously. Boil until potatoes are tender, about 20
  minutes. Drain. Cool 15 minutes; peel. Stir saffron in heavy large
  pot over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add
  reserved 1 cup cooking liquid; bring to simmer. Add artichokes,
  potatoes, mussels, shallots, butter and 3/4 teaspoon mustard seeds.
  Bring to boil. Cover pot; cook until mussels open and potatoes are
  golden, about 8 minutes. (Discard any unopened mussels.) Mix in green
  onions. Season with salt and pepper. Divide stew among 6 shallow soup
  bowls. Sprinkle with chives and serve.

 Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Jaw
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    4 oz chicken breasts
      1    Clove garlic
  1 1/2 c  Frozen or canned artichoke
           Hearts, rinsed and drained
      1    Egg yolk

  Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Grease a baking pan.
  
  Salt and pepper the chicken breasts. With a very sharp small knife,
  cut a pocket horizontally into each breast. Do not cut in half. Set
  aside while you make the stuffing.
  
  In a food processor, place the garlic, artichoke hearts, egg yolk,
  cream, bread crumbs, nutmeg and about 1/4 cup of parsley. Process to
  mix, but do not puree.
  
  Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of stuffing in each breast pocket. Do not
  close the pocket-the stuffing will puff up and out a bit.
  
  Place the stuffed breasts in the baking dish. Pour the chicken broth
  over the chicken. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake 12 to 15 minutes. Place
  the breasts on a platter, spoon the pan juices over and sprinkle with
  reserved 2 tablespoons parsley.

      2 tb Virgin olive oil
        lg Basil leaves;
           - sliced in strips

           -=OR=-Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
           Lemon juice; to taste
           -=OR=- Champagne Vinegar
 
  SLICE THE UPPER 2/3 of the leaves off the artichokes, then break off
  the remaining leaves, snapping them off at the base. Trim off the
  dark green stubs, going around the artichoke with a paring knife. Cut
  them in quarters, remove the fuzzy choke and slice each quarter into
  pieces 1/4-to-1/2-inch thick. As you work, rub the cut surfaces with
  lemon and put them in a bowl with the lemon juice and water to cover.
  Gently warm the olive oil with half the basil. When it is fairly hot,
  but not sizzling, add the onions and the sliced artichokes. Salt
  lightly and give them a stir to coat them with the oil, then add 3/4
  cup water and cook over a medium-low flame. As the water cooks off,
  add more, in 1/2-cup increments until the artichokes are cooked,
  about 25 minutes. Add the peas and continue cooking until they are
  done. Let any liquids reduce until they are syrupy. Taste and season
  with salt. Add the rest of the basil, the parsley and the butter or
  olive oil. To brighten the flavors, stir in a little lemon juice or

  :          Salt and pepper
      1/2 c  virgin olive oil
        2    lemons -- cut in wedges
  
  Pull off outer layers of deep green leaves from each artichoke and
  discard. Cut off stem and set aside. Rub each cut with a lemon wedge.
  Place artichoke on its side and cut off top third. Discard these
  points. Using a pair of scissors, cut offthe sharp points. Soak 10
  minutes in cold water with 1 ounce. lemon juice.
  
  Carefully open the leaves by prying with your fingers as if opening a
  flower and the pressing down on the counter the opening face. Drain
  each artichoke on paper towels, shaking to remove all liquid. Season
  aggressively with salt and pepper between each leaf and all over.
  
  Heat the virgin olive oil in a tall side sauce pan, 8-inch to 10-inch
  wide at base until just smoking.
  
  Cook artichokes in this hot oil 12 to 15 minutes, until golden all
  over. After 10 minutes of cooking, spritz the pan by shaking your wet
  hand over the artichokes to mist them. Be careful: this will cause
  the oil to sizzle and spatter..
  
  When the artichokes are cooked, remove each one, and holding the
  artichoke by skewering its base with a fork, press the flower side
  down to force it further open. Drain on paper towels, season with
  salt and pepper again and serve with lemon wedges.

 Categories: Italian, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12    Artichokes; medium, fresh
      2    Lemons; juice and rinds
      2 tb -salt
      1 ts -pepper; freshly ground
      3 c  Olive oil
 
  Carciofo All Guidia To quote the author, "This is the most famous of
  all Italian Jewish foods. It originated with the Roman Jews, and owes
  its fame to having been served at a restaurant in the Roman ghetto
  where it was discovered and quickly adopted by connoisseurs of
  excellent food all over Europe. Utimately it found its way into many
  Italian cookbooks, My mother, a Jewish woman who was born and raised
  in Rome, prepared especially delicious Carciofi all Guidia (better
  than you could find in any restaurant!). I watched her prepare them,
  and have prepared them myself, practically all my life. Here in my
  mother's technique in detail"
  
  Trim the artichokes as detailed in "How to clean artichokes- Jewish
  style" and keep them in lemon water till you are ready to use them.
  "Drain the two artichokes and, holding one in each hand by the stem
  and bottom, gently hit the leafy parts against each other until the
  leaves of one open up a little. Place the opened artichoke, bottom
  up, on a board or a working surface. Drain another artichoke from its
  bath and repeat what you did with the first two, and line up the one
  that opens next to the last one. Continue until all the artichokes
  are opened up. The last one will have to be tapped against the board.
  In a small bowl, combine salt and pepper. Take one artichoke at a
  time and sprinkle all over, including between the leaves, with salt
  and pepper mixture. Heat the oil in a deep earthenware or similar
  saucepan. Cook as many artichokes at a time as fit in one layer over
  moderate heat for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the bottoms and the
  sides are well browned. During the cooking period, sprinkle some cold
  water over the artichokes to produce steam, so that the inside will
  be cooked, too. To do this the authentic way, have a bowl containing
  cold water near the range. Dip your closed fist in the water and then
  open it forcefully over the roasting artichokes. Repeat sprinkling
  several times. When all the artichokes are done, transfer them to a
  plate, bottom side down to keep the moisture in.* Pick them up at the
  bottom with a fork and dip them, one by one in the hot oil again,
  pressing the leaves to the bottom of the pan. The artichokes will
  open up like roses and the leaves will become golden and crisp. Serve
  immediately.
  
  NOTE: Although traditionally Carciofi alla Giudia are served piping
  hot, they are delicious at room temperature.
  
  *Up to this point you may prepare the artichokes several hours ahead
  of time and keep them, bottom side down, so that they do not lost
  their moisture. Should they become too dry, sprinkle some cold water
  on them when reheating and press the leaves down against the bottom
  of the pan.

      Title: ARUGULA~ PINE NUT & PARMESAN SALAD
 Categories: Italian/tus, Salads/dres
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
      3 oz Arugula -- stemmed and
           Washed
      2 oz Parmigiano-reggiano cheese
      1 tb Red wine vinegar
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
           Fine sea salt to taste
 
  1. Preheat the oven to 350#161#.
  
  2.  Spread the nuts loosely on a baking sheet. Toast until lightly
  browned, about 10 minutes. Check every few minutes to avoid burning
  the nuts. Remove from the oven and turn out onto a large plate to
  cool.
  
  3. In a large shallow salad bowl, combine the arugula and toasted pine
  nuts. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan cheese into long
  thick strips directly into the bowl. Season the salad with fine sea
  salt and toss gently to blend.
  
  4. Drizzle 1 tablespoon vinegar over the salad and season with
  pepper, and toss to blend. Add just enough oil to very lightly coat
  the arugula, and toss to blend. Serve immediately, arranging on large
  serving plates.

  arugula transforms this traditional soup base.

  served hot, as a main dish, or chilled, as a first course.

  chopped garlic.
    Combine remaining ingredients, EXCEPT the oil. Pour mixture over

  Bring salted water to a boil. With wet hands, roll about 1 teaspoon of
  matzo ball mixture between your palms into a ball; mixture will be
  very soft. Set balls on a plate. With a rubber spatula, carefully
  slide balls into boiling water. Cover and simmer over low heat for
  about 30 minutes or until firm. Cover and keep warm until ready to
  serve. (Matzo balls can be kept 2 days in their cooking liquid in a
  covered container in refrigerator; reheat gently in cooking liquid or
  in soup.)
  
  To serve soup, remove chicken wings, onion, celery, parsnip, parsley
  and dill sprigs. Take meat off bones and add to soup; or reserve for
  other uses. Add pepper to soup, stir in snipped dill and taste soup
  for seasoning. Slice carrot and add a few slices to each bowl. With a
  slotted spoon, add a few matzo balls. Serve hot.

  wrap. Cook at high power for 10 minutes. Prick plastic to release
  steam. Remove, uncover, spoon sauce over eggplants. Serve as side
  dish. Recommended with grilled fish steak or chicken breast (of
  course I'd baste that with a soy based marinade).
  
  I may try this over a wok steamer rather than in the microwave.
  
  WHICH REMINDS ME: Stephen, I love a dish which I have seen referred
  to as Yu Shaing Eggplant. Based on a Yu Shaing sauce. Which is, to
  some extent, translated as fish sauce (I know the yu or ju is fish)
  not made from it but to go with it, I gather. It is certainly not
  nuoc mam but I don't know if it contains it. It is rather hot and by
  flavor I would guess it comes from the northern provinces - perhaps
  NE end of China. I have also had it with fresh pork strings.
  Glorious. Do you have any idea what it is or a recipe??? I have been
  unable to find it anywhere in my Chinese library. The restaurant
  where I eat it is not one to give recipes or ingredients to
  non-Chinese (if they'd give it to the Chinese. The place is popular
  with the newer Chinese community here. (The old timers are all
  Cantonese and so well integrated that they probably consider red
  beans and rice their dish).

      Title: ASIAN MILLET SALAD
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Cooked millet
      6 tb Mirin or dry sherry
      1    10-oz  package of tofu,
           Diced
      3 tb Soy sauce
    3/4 c  Chopped snow peas
  1 1/2 tb Rice or cider vinegar
    3/4 c  Frozen peas, thawed
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      1    8-oz  can sliced water
           Chestnuts
      1 ts Sugar (or other sweetener)
    1/2 c  Chopped scallion
 
  In a large bowl, combine the millet, tofu, snow peas, peas, water
  chestnuts, and scallion.
  
  In a small bowl, stir together the mirin, soy sauce, venegar, garlic,
  and sugar.  Pour over the salad and toss to combine.
  
  Although the original recipes didn't say to, I let both of these
  salads chill for awhile to let the flavors blend before I served
  them. I think that this step is a particularly good idea for the
  Asian Millet salad, as it allows the tofu to absorb the flavors of
  the dressing. If you try these, I hope you enjoy them as much as I
  did!

      Title: ASIAN PEAR & LYCHE STRUDEL
 Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Fruits, Chinese, Myan
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 ea Phyllo dough, sheets
    1/4 c  Butter, melted
    1/3 c  Coconut, toasted,
           -- shredded
      2 c  Lyche, seeded, halved
    1/4 c  Walnut, roasted, chopped
    1/4 c  Raisins, soaked in
           -- plum wine
      3 tb Ginger, candied
  1 1/2 c  Asian pear, peeled, diced
      1 ts Zest, lemon
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Juice, lime OR
      1 tb Juice, lemon
      1 ts Five spice, powder
      1 tb Wine, plum
           Sugar, confectioner's
 
  Filling: ========
  
       Soak your golden raisins in plum wine overnight or longer.
  
       Depending on the ingredients available to you, mix appropriate
  quantities up so as to fill the dough. You can certainly use more or
  less of each ingredient to suit your individual tastes. You'll need
  about four cups total filling.
  
  Assembly: =========
  
       Spread the two sheets of phyllo dough out on your work surface,
  one on top of the other.  Paint the top layer of dough with some of
  the melted better and then spread a nice thin layer of toasted
  coconut over the entire pastry.
  
       Pour your filling along the long edge of the phyllo dough, and
  roll the dough up as tightly as possible (remember to fold in the
  ends as you roll so the ends are "sealed") and put on a non-stick
  baking sheet.
  
       Paint the top of the roll with melted butter and bake at 350 F
  until the dough is golden brown.
  
       When done, take the strudel out of the oven and let it cool on a
  rack. Just before serving, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over the
  top. Slice the roll on a diagonal for a more attractive presentation.
  
       For elegant presentation, you might serve the strudel pieces on a
  plate with slices of kiwi, orange, lemon, and pear as garnish.

      Title: ASPARAGUS & BLUE CHEESE QUICHE
 Categories: Starters, Cheese/eggs, Tarts, French, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Pastry *
      1 oz Blue cheese (good)
  1 1/2 oz Cream cheese (Philadelphia)
    200 ml Made up to with half & half
      3 md Eggs
           Salt, pepper & cayenne
      8 oz Asparagus; peeled & cooked
 
  NB* As usual, the weight of pastry is the weight of flour used to
  make it.
  
    Roll out the pastry and line a 9" flan ring. Bake blind as usual at
  a high temperature (400 for 8-9 mins weighted down then a futher 2-3
  mins just to colour lightly). Meanwhile, mash the cheeses together,
  put into a
  
  measuring jug and make up to volume with cream or cream and milk.
  Beat hard with the eggs (food processor). Season to taste with salt,
  pepper and cayenne as usual.
    The asparagus should have been peeled/trimmed as usual and boiled in
  strongly salted water until just tender - for really freshly picked
  asparagus <15 minutes will suffice. Immediately remove from water and
  separate on a paper towel to cool quickly. When cold, cut into 2"
  lengths
  
  and spread out on the flan base. Pour over the custard and bake in a
  moderate oven (375F) for around 30 minutes until nicely set. Serve
  warm (not cold or too hot).

      Title: ASPARAGUS & CHICKEN IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Chicken thighs
     12 md Asparagus spears
      3 tb Peanut or corn oil
           MARINADE:
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 ts Cornstarch
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 pn Sugar
           SAUCE:
      2 ts Fermented black beans
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Brown sugar
      2 ts Black soy sauce
    3/4 c  Chicken stock
           Cornstarch paste as
           -thickener
 
  Marinating:  With sharp paring knife, scrape chicken meat from thigh;
  slice into thin strips across the grain. (Breast meat is not
  preferred for this dish, as meat is too dry and spongy.) Combine
  sherry, soy, cornstarch and sugar in bowl; massage liquid into meat
  with your fingers. Marinate for 15 to
       30    minutes. Preparation: Wash asparagus; peel tough white
  outer skin off ends; slice on diagonal in 2 1/2" sections. Rinse
  fermented black beans. In bowl, combine and mash black beans and
  garlic, brown sugar, black soy sauce and chicken stock; stir; reserve
  for 15 minutes. Stir-Frying: Add 2/3 of oil to hot wok; when oil is
  very hot, add chicken. Stir-fry for about 3 minutes on high heat - or
  until chicken begins to shrink and firm up.  Remove chicken to
  holding bowl. Reheat wok to high, add remaining oil. When oil is hot,
  add black bean sauce. Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add asparagus; mix with
  sauce. Stir sauce with asparagus. When sauce boils, add cooked
  chicken; toss to combine. Dribble in a little cornstarch paste if
  needed; cornstarch in chicken marinade might be enough. Toss
  ingredients until very little liquid remains and is reduced to glaze.
  Dish is ready when asparagus brightens. If you still have too much
  liquid, remove ingredients, continue to reduce sauce, then return
  ingredients to coat them with sauce. Serve in individual portions.

      Title: ASPARAGUS & CRAB MEAT SOUP (MANG TAY NAU CUA)
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Chicken broth
      1 tb Plus 2 teaspoons nuoc mam
           -(Vietnamese fish sauce)
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      6    Shallots, chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped
      8    Ounces lump crab meat,
           -picked over and drained
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Cornstarch or arrowroot,
           -mixed with
      2 tb Cold water
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
     15 oz White asparagus spears *
      1 tb Shredded coriander
      1    Scallion, thinly sliced
 
  * cut into 1-inch sections with canning liquid reserved
  
  This soup was probably created by some homesick Frenchman. White
  asparagus (a French import), packed in jars or cans, is used for this
  recipe. Traditionally, crumbled, salted duck egg yolk is added to
  season the soup.
  
  If white asparagus is unavailable, use frozen or fresh asparagus (in
  this case, add the fresh asparagus to the broth from the very
  beginning and cook until tender, before adding the remaining
  ingredients).
  
  Combine the broth, 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce, the sugar and salt
  in a 3 quart soup pot.  Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer.
  
  Meanwhile, heat the oil in a skillet.  Add the shallots and garlic and
  stir-fry until aromatic.  Add the crab meat, the remaining 2
  teaspoons fish sauce and black pepper to taste. Stirfry over high
  heat for
        1    minute. Set aside.
  
  Bring the soup to a boil.  Add the cornstarch mixture and stir gently
  until the soup thickens and is clear. While the soup is actively
  boiling, add the egg and stir gently. Continue to stir for about 1
  minute. Add the crab meat mixture and asparagus with its canning
  liquid; cook gently until heated through.
  
  Transfer the soup to a heated tureen.  Sprinkle on the coriander,
  scallion and freshly ground black pepper.
  
  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Asparagus, stiff ends
           Peeled
    1/4 lb Brown button mushrooms (or
           Mixed mushrooms)
      2    Garlic cloves
      1 tb Fermented black soybeans
  1 1/2 tb Rice vinegar
      1 tb Tamari (or soy sauce)
      1 ts Potato starch (or
           Cornstarch)
      1 ts Brown sugar
      1 tb Sake or other rice wine
 
  Cut asparagus on the diagonal into 1-2 inch pieces. Blanch for 5
  minutes in boiling water.  Drain and set aside.
  
  Wash and slice mushrooms. Set aside.
  
  Mince the garlic. Rinse the black beans well.  Mix garlic and beans
  together. Set aside.
  
  Mix together the rice vinegar, tamari, starch, sugar, and sake. Set
  aside.
  
  Fill a glass with water and set handy next to the stove. Put a
  skillet over high heat.  When the pan is hot, dump the garlic mixture
  into the pan. Stir fry for one minute, adding water as the mixture
  begins to stick -- add just a little at time.  Add the asparagus and
  stir fry for 10 minutes (or until asparagus is just shy of being
  crisp-done), again adding water just as needed.  Add mushrooms and
  stir fry for 2-5 more minutes. Add the vinegar mixture (giving it a
  last stir to make sure starch is well mixed), stir until evenly
  coated and sauce thickens. Serve immediately.
  
  Comments:
  
  Fermented black soybeans are available in Asian markets. Usually
  labled "salted black beans".  I find them in the preserved food
  section in plastic bags.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Digest
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Asparagus, trimmed, cut into
      1    " pieces
      2 c  Veggie broth
      1    Roasted red pepper
           -diced(1/3-1/2 cup total)
      1 cn Evap skim milk
           -x pepper to taste
 
  1. Place asparagus and broth into 4 qt pan and simmer for 15 min.,
  until tender.
  
  2. Puree asparagus/broth in blender. Take out some pieces for a
  chunkier consistency if you wish.
  
  3. Put puree back in pan and add red pepper, any reserved asparagus,
  black pepper, and can of milk.
  
  4. Heat until thickened to your liking.
  
  NOTE: You can add some thickener(flour,cornstarch) to hasten the
  process. I started the pepper roasting at about the same time as the
  the asparagus, and it worked out fine to add to soup.
  
  Serve with a salad and hearty bread!

      Title: ASPARAGUS & SESAME CHICKEN SOUP
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Soups/stews
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Chicken
      3 tb Sesame oil
      6    Slices ginger root
    1/2 c  Medium sherry
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Button mushrooms, canned
      8    Fresh asparagus spears
 
  Preparation:  Rinse chicken, remove fat pockets, pat dry, and chop
  into bite-size pieces.  NOTE:  if tempted to use breast meat without
  bones, please don`t; bones add to body and flavor of soup. Peel and
  slice ginger root.  Wash and cut asparagus into 2" sections.
  
  Braising:  Heat wok to medium hot.  Add sesame oil. Start braising
  chicken a few pieces at a time when oil begins to smell. Sesame oil
  will burn at lower temperature than other cooking oils, so avoid hot
  wok. After browning lightly, return chicken pieces to wok; add ginger
  slices, sherry and salt. When sherry boils, add water and sugar. Turn
  up heat, bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer
  for 30 minutes. Add mushrooms and asparagus, simmer for another 15
  minutes.
  
  Transfer to covered soup tureen (or put plate on top of soup bowl),
  place in steamer on low, and hold until ready to serve.
  
  You can make this soup in large sauce pan, if wok is needed for
  something else.

  2 1/2 qt Water
      2 lb Pork bones
      2 ts Salt
      1 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
      2    Shallots or
      2    Scallions, chopped white
           -part
    1/2 lb Crab meat, fresh, frozen,
           -or canned
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper

    1/4 c  Chopped fresh coriander
           -(Chinese parsley)
    1/4 c  Chopped scallion greens
 
  The French introduced asparagus to the Vietnamese, who promptly
  incorporated this classic vegetable into their cuisine. The
  Vietnamese word for asparagus is "Western bamboo," due to its
  resemblance to bamboo shoots. asparagus is universally popular
  throughout Vietnam, this light, tasty dish will delight your family
  as well.
  
  Bring water to a boil and put the pork bones in. Remove the scum, then
  cover and continue to boil the bones for 1 hour. Remove the bones
  from the stock and discard. Add the salt and the fish sauce to the
  stock.
  
  Heat the oil and add the chopped garlic and shallots; add the crab
  meat and fry for 5 minutes over high heat. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon
  of black pepper, stirring constantly, then add the crab meat mixture
  to the soup and bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch-and-water
  mixture and stir for a few minutes.
  
  Break the egg open and drop it into the actively boiling soup while
  stirring.  Cook, still stirring, for about 2 minutes, then drop in the
  asparagus, along with the liquid from the can and the rest of the
  black pepper.  Continue to cook until the asparagus is heated through.
  
  Sprinkle the coriander and scallion green over the soup before
  serving.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

 Categories: Vegetables, Pasta
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 lb Asparagus, trimmed
      3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      6    7 by 6 1/4 inch sheets
           No boil lasagna noodles
    1/8 lb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
    1/2 c  Water
      7 oz Mild goat cheese
           Such as Montrachet
      1 ts Freshly grated lemon
           Zest, or to taste
  1 2/3 c  Freshly grated
           Parmesan cheese
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  Cut the tips off each asparagus spear and reserve them. In each of 2
  large shallow baking pans toss half the asparagus stalks with half
  the oil, coating them well, and roast them in a preheated 500 F oven,
  shaking the pans every few minutes, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until
  they are crisp-tender.  Sprinkle the asparagus with salt to taste and
  let it cool. Cut the roasted asparagus into 1/2 inch lengths and
  reserve it.
  
  In a large bowl of cold water let the sheets of lasagna soak for 15
  minutes, or until they are softened. In a saucepan melt the butter,
  add the flour, and cook the roux over moderately low heat, stirring,
  for 3 minutes. Add the broth and the water in a stream, whisking,
  simmer the mixture for 5 minutes, and whisk in the goat cheese, the
  zest, and salt to taste, whisking until the sauce is smooth.
  
  Drain the pasta well, arrange 1 sheet of it in each of 2 buttered 8
  inch baking dishes, and spread each sheet with one fourth of the
  sauce. Top the sauce in each dish with one fourth of the reserved
  roasted asparagus and sprinkle the asparagus with 1/3 cup of the
  Parmesan. Continue to layer the pasta, the sauce, the asparagus, and
  the Parmesan in the same manner, ending with a sheet of pasta. In a
  bowl beat the cream with a pinch of salt until it holds soft peaks.
  Arrange the reserved asparagus tips decoratively on the pasta, spoon
  the cream over the pasta and the asparagus tips, spreading it with
  the back of the spoon, and sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan on
  top. Bake the lasagna in the middle of a pre- heated 400 F oven for
  20 to 30 minutes, or until it is golden and bubbling, and let it
  stand for 10 minutes before serving. Serves 8.

    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Whipping cream
      2    Egg whites
      1 ts Salt
 
  Break off tough stems from asparagus and discard. Peel lower half of
  asparagus stems; cut into 1-inch lengths. In saucepan of boiling
  salted water, cook asparagus for about 10-minutes or until tender;
  drain. In food processor or blender, process until smooth. There
  should be about 2 cups puree.  Transfer to saucepan. Add mayonnaise,
  lemon juice and onion; cook over low heat just until warmed through.
  
  Meanwhile, in small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over water; let stand
  for 5 minutes to soften.
  
  Over low heat, warm gelatin until disolved; stir into asparagus
  mixture. Transfer to bowl and place in large bowl of ice and water to
  chill, stirring frequently, for 10 to 15 minutes or until cold and
  slightly thickened.  Remove from iced water.
  
  Whip cream; set aside.  In large bowl, beat egg whites with salt until
  stiff peaks form.  Whisk about one-quarter of the beaten egg whites
  into cooled asparagus mixture; fold into remaining whites along with
  whipped cream.  Pour into rinsed 6-cup mould. Cover and refrigerate
  for at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.
  
  To unmould, wrap hot damp tea towel around mould for 1 minute. Using
  knife, loosen top edge of mousse from mould. Tilt or gently shake
  mould to loosen mousse. Invert rinsed serving platter on top of
  mould. Grasp platter and mould; quickly turn over.  Shake using quick
  downward motion, to release mousse from mould. Lift off mould. (If
  mousse sticks, repeat the procedure.)

      Title: ASPARAGUS NIBBLES
 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     25    Asparagus spears -- fresh
           Salt to taste
     25 sl Bread
           White or whole wheat
      8 oz Cream cheese -- softened
      3 oz Bleu cheese -- softened
      1    Egg
           Melted butter - 1 to 1 1/2
           Cups
 
  These wonderful little make-ahead hors d'oeuvres are a treat to
  assemble in the spring when asparagus hits the market. You can store
  them in your freezer for a time later in the year when the taste
  would really hit the spot.
  
  Blanch asparagus spears until barely tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain
  immediately and plunge into cold water to stop the cooking process.
  Remove crusts from bread and flatten slices with a rolling pin. In a
  medium bowl, combine cheeses and egg, blending with an electric
  beater. Spread mixture evenly over bread slices. Trim asparagus
  spears to same length as bread slices, and then place one spear on
  each slice and roll up, jelly roll fashion. Dip each roll in melted
  butter to coat all sides, and place on a cookie sheet. Freeze rolls
  until hard, then re-package in freezer-storage containers. When ready
  to bake, cut frozen rolls into thirds and bake (while still frozen)
  in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes or until lightly browned.  Serve
  immediately. Yields 75 pieces. (YES: 75) Source: Sandwich Cuisine, by

      Title: ASPARAGUS SALAD WITH RASPBERRY VINEGRETTE
 Categories: Side dish, Digest
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Fresh asparagus, washed well
           -and cut into 1" pieces
      1    Red pepper, seeded and cut
           -into 1/4" x 1" pieces
      1    Red onion, chopped
    1/2 c  Raspberry vinegar
    1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Sugar or honey
      1 ts Parsley
 
  Steam the asparagus pieces for 2 minutes.  Plunge into cold water to
  stop cooking.  Drain.
  
  Put asparagus, red pepper and onion into a plastic bowl (with cover).
  Blend vinegar, water, sugar (honey) and parsley in a separate bowl
  and then pour over vegetables. Adjust seasonings if desired (may want
  to add more sweetness).  Stir, cover and refrigerate for at least 24
  hours. Stir every so often.
  
  Serve cold as a side salad.
  
  Hint:  make sure you only use the tender part of the asparagus. My mom
  taught me that you hold the tip and base of the asparagus in separate
  hands and then bend it until it breaks. Only use the tip end and use
  the base end for soup or compost it.

      Title: ASPARAGUS SOUP (ZUPPA DI ASPARAGI)
 Categories: Italian, Soups/stews, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 lb Asparagus, trimmed, peeled
           -and cut (1 inch pieces)
           Salt and pepper
      1 qt Chicken broth
      4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan or
           -pecorino cheese
      6 sl Italian bread, toasted
 
  Heat the oil and garlic in a soup pot until the garlic is golden. Add
  the asparagus and cook until they begin to color. Season with salt
  and pepper. Add the broth and bring to a boil; reduce the heat and
  simmer for 15 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender.
  
  Beat the eggs and cheese together.  When the asparagus is tender,
  reduce the heat so the soup is no longer simmering. Very slowly ladle
  some of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, stirring continuously.
  After adding about 2 cups of the hot soup to the eggs, reverse the
  process and gradually stir the eggs mixture into the soup pot. The
  soup must not boil or the eggs will scramble.  Heat until thickened.
  
  Put one slice of toasted bread into each soup dish. Ladle the hot
  soup on top and pass additional grated cheese.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  To trim asparagus, hold the tip in one hand and the base of the
  stalk in the other.  Bend gently.  The asparagus will snap, leaving
  the tender part with the tip.

      2 ts Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Chives; minced
      4 tb Blue cheese; crumbled
           White pepper; freshly ground
 
  Snap ends off asparagus spears.  Fill medium skillet with 1-inch
  water and bring to a boil.  Add asparagus in single layer and cook 8
  to 10 minutes or until tender. Drain well and arrange on a serving
  plate. Stir together vinegar and oil in sm bowl.  Add blue cheese and
  chives and mix well. Pour over hot asparagus. Season to taste with
  plenty of white pepper. Set aside until tepid, then serve.
  
  Hint on cleaning asparagus:  Hold the bottom end of the stem in one
  hand and gently bend the stalk with the other. The stalk will break
  where it is tender, thus giving you a piece of asparagus that is
  entirely edible. With a little practice you will know exactly where
  to break the vegetable. Save the broken-off ends for soups. Slice and
  add to soup stock, then drain and discard the coarse stalks before
  serving.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Cooked Asparagus
      1 oz Finely Ground Hazelnuts
      2 tb Butter
      2 ts Cider Vinegar
           Salt And Pepper To Taste
 
  Wash asparagus under cold running water.  Snap off lower end of each
  stalk with your fingers.  Let the stalk break where it wants to, this
  will leave only the tender portion of the stalk. Young tender
  asparagus can be cooked in a steamer for 5-7 minutes, the more mature
  stalks for 7-10 minutes. Do not over cook asparagus, it will lose
  flavor and nutrients if over cooked. At the same time, place the
  hazelnuts and butter in a small heavy skillet. Heat until the butter
  melts and mix thoroughly. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar.
  Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour hazelnut butter over hot
  asparagus. Serve at once. From: Syd's Cookbook.

      Title: ASPARAGUS WITH OYSTER SAUCE
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Fresh asparagus; 6 or 7 spea
           Fresh or frozen oysters; all
      2 tb Dry white wine
      2    Egg yolks
     20    Butter
           Salt, pepper, cayenne
 
  Recipe by: ianst@qdpii.ind.dpi.qld.gov.au (Ian Staples) Another recipe
  courtesy of John Morris, butcher and caterer in Rockhampton,
  Queensland, Australia, as discussed on ABC [Australian Broadcasting
  Corp.] Radio on Sunday 13 March 1994 in the "Queensland Sunday"
  programme.
  
  John opened the discussion by stating that this is NOT a Lenten meal
  ;-) (He recommended it for breakfast in bed on Sunday mornings in
  fact.)
  
  Allow 6 or 7 spears per person.  Not too thin and not too old.
  
  Trim bottom 1" of the asparagus spears and peel the lower part if
  necessary (shouldn't be required if you've selected the bunches
  correctly and trimmed off the bottoms) then poach them gently - get
  about 1" of water boiling in
  
  Cut the oysters into thin strips rather than serving them as lumps.
  
  Reserve the juice from the oyster shells - should get about 2
  tablespoon fr Mix this with the dry white wine and reduce over heat
  by about 2/3rds (i.e. you'll have about 1 1/2 tablespoon left).
  
  Add this liquor and about 4 tablespoon of the poaching water slowly
  to the and whisk them over very low heat until light and frothy
  (note: do not have the liquor or the other fluid too hot when adding
  to the eggs - you don't want to curdle them).
  
  Add seasoning.  Then draw the sauce together by adding 20 gram of
  *cold* di butter and stirring it in gently. Add the oyster strips and
  fold through.
  
  Lay the freshly cooked asparagus spears on the serving plates and
  pour the oyster sauce over them (fairly now ;-).

 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Asparagus (preferably white)
      2 qt :boiling water mixed with
      4 ts Salt
      1    (9-in) unbaked pie shell
      3 oz Well aged Emmenthaler cheese
           -coarsely grated
    3/4 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Whipping cream
      2 md Eggs; lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
      1 tb Kirschwasser
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Finely snipped fresh dill OR
    1/2 ts -Dill weed
    1/4 ts Ground mace
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Emmenthaler is a dry, aged cheese that accents the flavor of
  asparagus. Serve as the main course of a light lunch or supper.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Snap coarse ends off asparagus stalks leaving
  spears about 3 1/2-inches long. (Save the trimmed-off ends to use for
  soup.) Peel the asparagus spears using a swivel-bladed vegetable
  peeler, lay them flat in a large heavy skillet, pour in boiling
  salted water and set over moderate heat. Cover and cook asparagus for
  about 10 minutes, until very tender. Drain well, return to the
  skillet and shake over moderate heat for 30 seconds or so to
  dissipate any excess moisture. Arrange the asparagus spears like the
  spokes of a wheel over the bottom of the pie crust, with their tips
  pointing toward the center. Combine the milk, cream, eggs, Parmesan
  cheese, Kirschwasser, salt, dill, mace and pepper, and pour the
  liquid evenly over the asparagus. Bake the tart, uncovered, for 35
  minutes, or until the filling has set. Remove the tart from the oven
  and cool it for at least 20 minutes before cutting.

MMMMM-----------------------PARSLEY BUTTER----------------------------
    1/3 c  Parsley; fresh minced
      3 tb Butter, unsalted; softened
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper

MMMMM----------------------------SOUP---------------------------------
    1/4 c  Butter, unsalted
      3    Leeks, large; chopped *
    1/2 ts Dried thyme; crumbled
      1    Bay leaf
      6 c  Chicken stock/canned broth
  1 1/2 lb Potatoes, red new; quartered
      1 lb Asparagus;trimmed,1"diagonal
 
  * Leeks: Use the white part and only 1 inch of the green part.
  
  Parsley butter: Mix the first 4 ingredients in small bowl. (Can be
  prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room
  temperature before using).
  
  Melt 1/4 cup unsalted butter in heavy large saucepan over low heat.
  Add leeks, thyme and bay leaf.  Cover and cook until leeks are soft,
  stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Mix in stock and potatoes.
  Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until potatoes are
  tender, about 12 minutes. Add asparagus and simmer until
  crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Season to taste with
  salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls. Top each with dollop of
  parsley butter and serve.
  
  This sounded very good, but my husband likes cream soups, so I added
  a FL sweet onion to the potato mixture and pureed all before I added
  the asparagus to the creamy soup. Adapted from Bon Appetit, April
  1991.

 Categories: Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 x  ---------marinating---------
  1 1/2 c  Water
      2 lb Headless shrimp
      1 tb Oyster sauce
    1/2 ts Hot chili sauce
      6 oz Tamarind
      1 x  ----------cooking-----------
      3 oz Young ginger root
      4 ea Large garlic cloves
      1 ts Blachan
      2 ea Small red onions
      3 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Dark soya sauce
      1 tb Hot chili sauce
      3 tb Oil
    1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
 
  MARINATING:  Break tamarind apart, place in a small saucepan with
  water. Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes or until pasty coating
  separates from seeds. Press through a sieve or food mill to extract
  all pulp and soupy liquid.  Discard seeds.  Rinse shrimps thoroughly,
  pat dry and marinate fro 1 hour with 1 tablespoon of this tamarind
  liquid, the oyster sauce and hot chili sauce. COOKING:  Meanwhile,
  cut young ginger into toothpick-sized slivers.  If using mature
  ginger, peel and sliver. Peel and sliver garlic. Place blachan in a
  non-stick pan and heat gently fro 3 to 4 minutes to develop the
  flavors.  Pell and cut red onions into wedges. Combine oyster, soy
  and chili sauces with blachan; stir into remaining tamarind liquid.
  Heat a large wok over high heat.  When a drop of water sizzles
  immediately into steam pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil. Swirl up
  sides of wok, and when just at smoking point, dump in ginger and
  garlic. Stir fry until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Adding more oil
  as needed, stir frey shrimp in batches until orange red, about 3
  minutes. Pour sauces over all the shrimp in the wok and cook at a
  brisk bubble over high heat until shrimps are aromatic and sauces
  have reduced and thickened to enrobe the shells, about 8 minutes. Mix
  in sugar and onion wedges, taste to adjust seasoning, sweetening and
  spiciness.  Makes plenty for 6 as a principal dish with rice, enough
  for
        8    with other dishes.

      2 oz SIZZLING RICE, UNCOOKED
 
       1. Mix together the shrimp, chicken, egg, and cornstarch. Heat 3
       cups of the oil in wok. When it is hot, add shrimp and chicken
       mixture. Cook for 1/2 minute and drain.
       2. Place above mixture in pot with the broth, mushroom, water
       chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and green beans. Bring to a boil. Add
       salt and sherry. Return to a boil. Reduce heat and allow to
       simmer.
       3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil until it is hot. Add rice
       and brown quickly. Drain and add to soup. Serve. By cooking the
       rice before it is added to the soup, we add a crunchy texture to
       this savory dish.

      Title: ASTAKOS PLAKI - LOBSTER IN TOMATO SAUCE WITH
 Categories: Greek, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Lobsters (about 2 lbs each)
           - (live, or recently dead)
     25    Saffron strands; soaked in
    1/4 c  Hot water
    1/4 lb Finely chopped onion
      1 md Leek; washed, finely chopped
      8 tb Fruity olive oil
      3    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 lb Tomatoes; skinned, seeded,
           - and finely chopped
      4    Sun-dried tomatoes (in oil)
           - pounded to a paste
    1/2 c  White wine
    1/4 c  Orange juice
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt & freshly ground Pepper
    1/2 c  Finely chopped Fennel
    1/2 c  Minced flat-leaf Parsley
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh Mint
           Saffron Rice
 
  If you have live lobsters, plunge them into a pan of boiling water
  for 1 minute, then into cold water.
  
  To prepare the lobsters, break off the claws and crack them open with
  a hammer.  Cut off the tip of the tail (with the fins), then sever
  the tail where it joins the head with a heavy knife. Cut the tail
  into rings, slicing through the shell between the ribs.
  
  Split the head open lengthwise with a hard blow of a knife and remove
  and discard the gritty stomach sac. Pour the coral (if any) and the
  green matter (which is the liver) into a stainer over a bowl,
  sprinkle with salt and pepper, and reserve.  Put the saffron to soak.
  
  In a heavy-bottomed pan big-enough to contain the lobsters and sauce,
  fry the onion and leek gently in 3 tablespoons olive oil until
  translucent. Add the garlic, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and
  liquid, wine, orange juice, and bay leaf.  Season and simmer,
  covered, for 15 minutes.
  
  Add the fennel, parsley, mint, saffron and liquid, and lobster tail
  pieces and claws with their shells (but not the legs) and simmer,
  covered, for 10 minutes.
  
  In the meantime push the coral and liver of the lobster through the
  strainer and beat the pure with the remaining olive oil. When the
  lobster has simmered for 10 minutes, ladle out about 1 cup sauce and
  beat this into the coral pure.  Pour this back into the pot, stir,
  and simmer for another 10 minutes. Serve with saffron rice.

    1/3 c  Cold water
      1 c  Honey

  This brew originated in Athol, Scotland (a district famouse for its
  deer hunting).  Early versions included water in which oatmeal had
  been soaked overnight.  Here gelating provides for the thickening.
  
  IN a small saucepan, sprinkle the gelatin over water and let soften
  for several minutes.  Place over low heat and cook, stirring
  occasionally,until gelatin dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cream
  and heat until mixture is quite warm (about 110F), 2 to 3 minutes.
  Remove form heat and stir in whisky.
  
  Serve warm or chilled.  Store brose in a sterilized bottle in the
  refrigerator, where it will keep for a month or more. If giving as a
  gift, place in an old fashioned bottle, and wrap in bright colored
  gift napkin or piece of fabric.

 Categories: Side dish, Indonesian, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    100 g  Carrots
           Salt
    100 g  Green beans
      4 ea Scallions
    100 g  White cabbage
      2 ea Toes of garlic
    1/4 ea Cucumber
      1 tb Oil
    150 ml Vinegar
    100 g  Bean sprouts/shoots
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Powdered ginger
      1 ts Kunjit/kurkuma
      1 ts Sambal ulek
 
  Cut carrot into the size of matches. Cut beans in 1" pieces. Chafe the
  cabbage. In a pan with a little water and salt, boil the vegetables
  for 5 minutes. Drain. Cut cucumber in *small* cubes. Peel scallions
  and garlic. Put in kitchen machine; cut to paste. Mix with sambal,
  kunjit and ginger. Heat oil in a frying pan. Fry the herb-mixture for
  2 minutes. Add vinegar and sugar; stir to dissolve sugar. Add all
  vegetables (also the ones not cooked yet); add a *little* water if
  there is too little liquid. Boil softly for 2 minutes. Put in a bowl
  and let cool. You can also preserve it by putting the hot veggies in
  sterilized screw-lid jars (metal lids with a 'dome' in the middle are
  quite handy, I always save jam-jars when they're empty); add liquid
  as well. Screw the lids on. Place jars upside down until cooled
  completely (the 'dome' in the lid will be down, this is to check if
  the jar closed well). Can be kept for at least a year (store in dark
  place to avoid having the color goes away). Nice as a present! Kunjit
  or kurkuma is a herb. If I look on the jar, it says 'powdered
  yellow-root'. It is used to color this dish, and other dishes as
  well. In that way it is much like saffron, although kunjit tastes a
  little bitter. Sambal ulek [INDONESIA]: Used as an accompaniment and
  in cooking. Made by crushing fresh red chilis with a little salt.
  Remove the seeds from the chilis, chop finely, then crush with salt
  using a pestle and mortar. Three chilis will make about 1 tablespoon
  sambal ulek. Also available ready-prepared in small jars from
  Oriental stores and some delicatessens. This is a refreshing side
  dish made of crisp, sweet-and-sour vegetables. Goes really well with
  Nasi Goreng. The dish can be kept in the fridge for a few days.

      Title: ATOLE - ATOLE DE ZARZAMORA
 Categories: Mexican, Beverages
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Jim Vorheis
      2 lb Wild blackberries
      2 c  Cold water
    1/2 c  Cold water
      3 oz Tortilla masa (1/3 cup)
      3 tb Crushed piloncillo or
           -dark brown sugar to taste
    1/2 c  Prepared tortilla masa, or
           -scant 1/2 cup masa harina
           -mixed with 1/3 cup water
    2/3 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  Warm milk
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
  1 1/2 oz Tablet drinking chocolate
      1    3-inch cinnamon stick
      3 tb Brown sugar, or to taste
 
  Though there are many variations, basically "atole" is a gruel
  thickened with masa, sweetened with raw sugar, and flavored with
  crushed fruits - such as pineapple and strawberries - or seasoned
  with chili. Some are made with a base of ground rice; others with
  fresh corn. For the Mexicans atole, too, is a natural accompaniment
  for tamales. For non-Mexicans, however, it is really not the sort of
  beverage that would generally be accepted, no matter how authentic.
  
  Blackberry atole Put the blackberries and water into a saucepan and
  cook over a medium flame, pressing them down from time to time, for
  about 10 minutes.  Puree the blackberries in a blender or food
  processor and press through a fine sieve, or the fine disk of a food
  mill, to extract the seeds, and return to the pan.
  
  Add the water to the masa and press out any lumps with the back of a
  wooded spoon.  When it is quite smooth, stir it into the strained
  blackberries. Cook over low heat, stirring often until the atole
  begins to thicken.
  
  Add the sugar and stir until dissolved.  It should take about 25
  minutes to reach the required consistency, so that the mixture will
  very lightly coat the back of a wooden spoon.
  
  Champurrado (Chocolate-flavored atole)
  
  Put the masa into the pan with the 2/3 cup water and cook over a low
  flame, stirring constantly, until it thickens - about 5 minutes.
  
  Gradually stir in the milk and water and cook until it begins to
  bubble. Add the chocolate, broken into pieces, the cinnamon stick,
  and the sugar and cook slowly, stirring, until the mixture thickens -
  about 15 minutes. The atole is done when a spoonful slides
  noiselessly rather than plops back into the mixture.

      Title: ATOMIC BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water
    1/8 ts Ground ginger
      2 tb Honey
     13 oz Can evaporated milk
      1 ts Salt (optional)
      2 tb Oil
      4    To 4 1/2 cups whole wheat
           -flour
 
  Makes 1 large loaf
  
  Dissolve yeast in the warm water in large mixing bowl. Blend in the
  ginger and 1 Tbsp of the honey.  Let stand in a warm place until the
  mixture is bubbly (about 15 minutes). Stir in the remaining honey,
  and the milk, salt, and oil.  With mixer on low speed (or with a
  wooden spoon) beat in the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after
  each addition. If you are using amixer, beat in the last cup of flour
  with a wooden spoon. The dough should be heavy but too sticky to
  knead.
  
  Place dough in a 2-pound, WELL-GREASED coffee can. Cover with greased
  plastic lid.  At this point, you may freeze the dough if you want to
  and bake it at a later time.
  
  To bake, let stand, covered in a warm place until the dough rises and
  pops off the lid.  This will take 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Discard the lid
  and bake at 350 F for 1 hour. The crust will be very brown. Brush the
  top lightly with butter.
  
  Let the entire bread and can cool for 5 to 10 minutes on a wire rack,
  then loosen the crust around the edge of the can with a thin knife
  and slide the bread from the can. Cool it in an upright position on
  the wire rack.
  
  VARIATION:  Add to the yeast mixture 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp
  nutmeg. With the final addition of flour, add 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2
  cup chopped walnuts.

      2 c  Onions; peeled and finely
           -diced

      1 ts Minced garlic
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Sea salt
      2 c  Soysage
      2 c  Tofu, firm or extra firm;
           -crushed by hand
           Whole wheat pie dough for
           -two double crusted pies
    1/4 c  Barley malt syrup
 
   Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Saute th epotatoes, onions,
  broccoli and garlic for a few minutes. Add the seasonings and
  continue cooking for a few minutes, stirring constantly.Finally, add
  the soysage and tofu and cook until the mixture is hot, stirring
  constantly.
  
   Roll out half of the dough and prepare the bottom crust for each of
  two small pies. Put 3 cups of filling in each pie pan. Roll out the
  top crusts and place them over the pies. Seal the edges of the top
  and bottom crusts, wetting the edges first with water.
   Bake in apreheated oven at 400 degrees for 40 mintues or until th
  etop crusts are browned. When the pie has baked for about 30 minutes,
  you can glaze the top crust with amixture of 1/4 cup barley malt
  syrup and 2 tbs water. Just lightly glaze the crust and return the
  pie to the oven. The glaze will make the crust shiny and brown.
  
   Variation:  You may prefer to add a bread crumb topping to the pie
  instead of a top crust. Prepare the topping by lightly mixing 1/2 cup
  whole wheat bread crumbs and 1/4 cup oil. Sprinkle it over the pie
  filling and bake the pie acording to the recipe.

      Title: AUBERGINE LOAF
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
    350 g  Aubergine
      3    Eggs
     75 g  Breadcrumbs
     50 g  Grated cheese
      2 tb Freshly chopped basil
    100 ml Olive oil
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
      1 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
           Salt and pepper
 
  Serves 3-4
  
  Most vegetable 'loaves' take an eternity to make, but this one is the
  exception. Everything goes into the blender, and it is made in next
  to no time. The result is outstandingly good, a loaf that is
  delicious hot, warm or cold. You can also make it using mushrooms
  instead of the aubergines, and the result is also memorable.
  
  Cut the aubergine into pieces and mince in the blender. Put into a
  bowl. Whizz all the rest of the ingredients in the blender and fold
  in the minced aubergine. Bake in a greased loaf tin (500 g or 1 lb)
  at 200 degrees C / 400 degrees F / gas 6 for 20 minutes, then at 180
  degrees C / 350 degrees F / gas 4 for a further 15 minutes or until a
  knife comes out clean from the centre. Cover with a cloth for 10
  minutes, then turn out of the tin.

      1 ts Brown sugar
      2 lg Tomatoes
 
  This is a relish which can be used hot or cold.
  
  Slice the aubergine and sprinkle it with salt; leave to stand for
  half an hour, then rinse and dry. Cut up the tomatoes and remove the
  seeds.
  
  Crush the terasi and garlic together. Slice the onion thinly, and fry
  until slightly brown. Add the garlic and terasi, the sugar and the
  chilli powder. Put in the aubergine, and mix well. Add the tomatoes,
  cover the pan, and continue cooking gently for 5 minutes. Taste, and
  add salt if necessary. Then put the mixture into a pudding basin and
  steam it for 20 minutes.
  
  If you want this relish to be really hot--spicy hot--then take 4 green
  chillis, seed them and chop finely, and put them into the frying-pan
  at the same time as the onions. Alternatively, use dried red chillis:
  soak them for at least 15 minutes and put them into the mixture,
  whole, when everything goes into the basin for steaming.

     25 g  Breadcrumbs
      1 tb Chopped spring onions
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
      1 tb Fresh chopped thyme
           -OR- oregano
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
           Salt
 
  Serves 2-3
  
  This is a simple, rather classic way of sauteeing aubergines with
  garlic, parsley, spring onions and breadcrumbs. Its mouth-watering
  flavours and irresistible textures make a lovely supper dish, served
  with a tomato salad and hot, soft rolls.
  
  Cut the aubergines into large cubes. Saute in hot olive oil, shaking
  the pan frequently until browned all over on the outside and tender
  inside. Dry on kitchen paper and keep warm.
  
  Fry the breadcrumbs in more oil until golden all over, add the spring
  onions, garlic and herbs and then return the aubergines to the pan.
  Toss over a moderately high heat until the aubergines are sizzling,
  add salt to taste, then toss in the parsley and serve in a hot dish.

      1 tb Soy sauce
      4 sm Aubergines
           Vegetable oil
           - for deep frying
           Sesame seeds to garnish
 
  Browned sesame seeds, pounded with a little soy sauce, make an
  interesting coating for deep-fried aubergines, and give them an added
  subtlety of flavour. Serve them warm, with a rice dish - or chilled,
  with a salad meal.
  
  In a small heavy pan shake the sesame seeds over a moderate heat,
  stirring and shaking the pan, for 4-5 minutes until golden. Reserve
  1/4 tsp of the sesame seeds and transfer the rest to a mortar. Crush
  them with the soy sauce.
  
  Cut the aubergines in half lengthwise, and cut each half diagonally
  into thirds. Deep-fry the aubergine in very hot vegetable oil for 1
  minute or until just tender. Dry on paper towels. While the aubergine
  is still warm toss it with the sesame mixture. Put on to a
  serving-dish and garnish with the reserved sesame seeds.

 Categories: France, Poultry, Soups/stews
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Chicken, quartered
      2    Carrots, peeled and diced
      1    Shallot, sliced
      4    Pippin apples**
      1 lb White mushrooms, washed and
           -minced
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Oil
      2    Onions - one sliced, one
           -studded with cloves
      1 c  Dry white wine
      1    Clove garlic
           Thyme leaves
           Bay leaves
           Salt and fresh ground black
           -pepper
      1 c  Creme fraiche or whipping
           -cream**
      1    Shot glass (1 Tablespoon)
           -Calvados**
      3    Egg yolks
 
  **For the apples I used Granny Smith's. For the creme fraiche or
  whipping cream, I used the whipping cream. For the Calvados - which
  would have been too expensive to use, even if I had located it over
  here, I substituted an apple flavored liqueur and just added a little
  brandy. (Calvados is a dry apple brandy from Calvados in Northern
  France - very good, but I couldn't find it locally) In a cast iron
  casserole, lightly brown the chicken in half the butter and 2
  Tablespoons oil. When all the pieces are nice and golden. add the
  carrots, shallots and the sliced onion and cook for a few minutes.
  Pour the white wine and 1 cup of water over the chicken, then add the
  clove studded onion and the garlic. Add some thyme leaves and bay
  leaves and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over low
  heat for 40 minutes. (While this was cooking the 40 minutes, I peeled
  and minced the mushrooms - I know everyone tells me there is no need
  to peel the mushrooms, but I always do <g>) Remove the chicken from
  the heat, arrange the pieces of chicken in an ovenproof serving dish
  and keep warm. Pass the cooking liquid through a sieve. Set the
  vegetables aside and keep warm. Meanwhile melt the remaining butter
  in a skillet with the oil, add the apples and cook until just lightly
  brown on all sides. Remove the apples from the skillet and arrange
  them around the chicken. Keep the dish warm in the oven. Saute the
  mushrooms until they have lost all their juices. Set aside to add to
  the sauce. To make the sauce: Pour the strained cooking liquid into a
  saucepan and set over medium heat. With a whisk, beat in the cream,
  the calvados and the egg yolks in that order. Simmer in a double
  boiler until it has thickened to a light cream. Stir in the mushrooms
  and the vegetables, discarding the clove-studded onion. Adjust
  seasoning. Remove the dish from the oven, spoon some of the sauce
  over the chicken and pour the remaining sauce into a sauceboat and
  serve. From The Cookie Lady's Files

      2 c  Low-fat plain yogurt

           -dice
           Coarsely ground black pepper
           -to taste
 
  Whenever cold soups call for chicken broth, be sure to defat it
  completely for best results. Also, black pepper is the only spice in
  this chowder, so freshly ground is a MUST.
  
  1. Place broth, corn cobs and dill sprigs in a heavy pot. Bring to a
  boil, reduce heat, simmer 10 minutes. Discard cobs and dill.
  
  2. Add potatoes to broth and cook for 8 minutes or until tender. Add
  corn kernels and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from heat; pour soup
  through a strainer, reserving vegetables and broth.
  
  3. Place yogurt and 2/3 of the diced cucumbers in the bowl of a food
  processor; pulse on and off just to combine ingredients (so some
  texture remains). With motor on, pour in 1 cup of reserved broth
  through feed tube and pulse machine on to just combine ingredients.
  Remove to a bowl. Save any leftover broth for another use.
  
  4. Stir in the reserved vegetables, remaining diced cucumber, bell
  pepper and chopped dill. Season with fresh black pepper. Refrigerate
  for up to 2 hours. Serve chilled.

  bowls and ladle soup on top.

      1 pn Mace
      1 lg Steak (just over 1 lb), at
           -least 1 1/4 inches
 
  ((Note:  Per Horst Scharfenberg, this recipe originated in the town of
  Idar-Oberstein in the 19 th century, when gemstone prospectors
  returning from South America created their own version of
  gaucho-grilled steaks. The dish was then further refined by
  Scharfenberg's mentor August Goerg. K.B.))
  
  Per person: thick, trimmed
  
  Mix together the shallot or onion with the pepper and mace. Insert a
  few shallot pieces into the steak using the point of a small knife.
  Coat the steak with the shallot mixture, pressing it in so it will
  adhere.
  
  Remove the loose shallot pieces and grill the steak (over a fire of
  oak logs, says August Goerg, from which the bark has been removed).*
  Take the steaks off the grill while they are still pink inside.
  Sprinkle them with salt.
  
  *Note:  A special grill is used, suspended with 3 chains from an iron
  tripod and constantly swinging through the flames.

  Leave to marinate overnight. Next day, transfer mixture to a large
  soup pot. Add the leeks (reserving one) and the onion, and season to
  taste. Bring slowly to a boil, cover, and then simmer for 2 hours, or
  until the bird is tender. Skim off excess fat from the liquid. Remove
  the chicken from the pot, skin, remove bones and cut meat into pieces
  before returning to the pot (cut up the shin of beef, if necessary).
  Add the prunes and remaining sliced leek and simmer gently for 10-15
  minutes.

      Title: AUNT ANN'S CELERY SEED DRESSING
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Dry mustard
      2 ts Salt
      1 sm Onion, chopped fine
      2 c  Oil
      1 c  Vinegar
      2 ts Celery seed
      1    Garlic clove
 
  Mix all ingredients together. I use my blender then I don't have to
  chop the onions. This will keep several weeks in a jar with a plastic
  lid. Do not use a metal lid, since the vinegar will rust the lid.
  
  You can adjust the sugar and salt to suit your own taste. We find
  that 1 1/4 c sugar is too much, and so is 2 t of salt.
  
  The dressing is especially good on a fresh fruit or spinach salad.
  
  This recipe comes from my Husband's Aunt, Ann Mitchell.

      Yield: 1 Batch
 
           Recipe
 
  AUNT ELLEN NOTT'S CORNISH PASTY RECIPE Aunt Ellen was born in 1851
  and was 85 years old when she taught me [Mabel Weller] (in Cornwall
  1938) to make pasties. I like to think that she had been taught by
  her mother. The ingredients are simple: pie crust, cubed round steak,
  onions and potatoes, salt and pepper. Turnip or leeks can be used for
  a change of flavour. All ingredients are raw. Roll out pie crust and
  cut into rounds or ovals about the size of a butter plate. On one
  half of the pie crust arrange, in this order, a few slices of potato,
  a layer of onion, a pile of steak and the salt and pepper. Moisten
  the edge of the crust around the filling, and fold the bare crust
  over. Seal the edge very well or the onion juices will run out and
  make the pasty stick to the baking dish. Cut two vents in the top.
  Bake at 400 F for about an hour. Modern pasties seem to be made with
  leftovers: ground up cooked meat and left over assorted vegetables
  mixed together in a pastry which is joined in a thick roll at the
  top. This was reported by recent visitors to the U.K.

      Title: AUNT JEMIMA MAPLE SYRUP
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
      2 c  Dark corn syrup
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Maple flavoring
 
  1) Combine first 4 ingreds. in saucepan over med. heat. 2) Stir
  occasionally, until mixture comes to full boil. Let it boil for 7
  min. 3) Turn off heat and let syrup cool for 15 min. 4) Add the maple
  flavoring and stir. 5) When completely cool, transfer syrup to a
  covered plaxtic or glass container.
  
  Yield:  1 qt.
  
  The year 1989 marked the 100th anniversary of the Aunt Jemima
  trademark. The name was conceived in 1889 by Chris Rutt while he was
  attending a vaudeville show and watching a New Orleans-style dance
  number performed to a jazzy tune called "Aunt Jemima."  Rutt liked
  the music so much he stuck the name on his products. The syrup came
  along much later, in 1964, and is now the country's largest selling
  syrup.
       Today some folks tell the story of how their friends or
  relatives one met Aunt Jemima many years ago and how she was a kind a
  cordial woman. Little do they realize these people were fooled by a
  promo. campaign for the broducts back in the 40's & 50's that used
  actresses traveling from town to town dressed up and acting like the
  "famous woman." There never really was an Aunt Jemima. ~--from "Top

  Rich, this is an old favorite of mine, from my great-grandmother.
  Thought everyone would enjoy it.  I love them, and so does the rest
  of my family. They were always part of Christmas baking for us.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine shortening, oats, flour, sugar,
  raisins, milk, cinnamon, soda and salt. It should stick together when
  you squeeze a small amount in your hand. Drop small amounts on sheet.
  Bake 10 minutes.
  
  Hope you try them, they are the best I've ever tasted, though I'm
  probably biased.

      Title: AUNT MARG'S PRESSED BEEF
 Categories: Meats, Seasonings, Spreads, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Beef (inexpensive cut)
      1    Meaty soup bone
      1    Onion; peeled & quartered
      1    Carrot; quartered
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Salt
           ;Water to cover
      1 tb Mixed whole pickling spices
           -- tied in cheesecloth bag
      1 cn Beef consomme or
           Rich beef stock
      3 tb Unflavored gelatin
 
  The author writes:  "Spread on hot buttered toast, this protein-rich
  snack is ideal for chilled skiers or skaters. Blade steaks, blade
  roast, cross rib roast and stewing beef are all suitable cuts."
  
  Place beef (bones, fat and all) into a large, heavy stockpot with the
  soup bone, onion, carrot, bay leaf and salt. Cover with cold water
  and bring to the boil, uncovered. Skim off any foam and cook two
  hours or more (until beef falls off the bone).  Cover pot; let stand
  in a cool place overnight to solidify fat. Next day, skim off and
  discard fat, along with carrots, onions and bay leaf.  Remove meat
  from bones and discard bones. Shred beef with a knife.  Return
  shredded meat to stock in the pot; place over high heat.  Add
  pickling spices (tied in bag) and let come to a boil. Add consomme.
  Once stock is boiling, add gelatin. Stir and let simmer another 1
  minute.
  
  Spoon stock plus beef into a large mold or ceramic bowl (or two
  smaller ones) and let sit in refrigerator, several hours or overnight.
  
  Good with hot mustard, salt and pepper.  Keeps well, refrigerated, 1
  week.
  
  Yield:  6 to 8 servings.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter
      8 oz Noodles, uncooked
      3    Eggs, beaten
      4 oz Cottage cheese
      2 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
     12 oz Pineapple, crushed,
           -with juice
           Cornflake crumbs, to top
 
  Melt butter in a 9x13 pan.  Add noodles.
  
  Combine remaining ingredients, except crumbs, spread evenly over
  noodles. Top with crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about an hour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Noodle kugel using uncooked noodles -- This recipe is interesting
  because you don't cook the noodles first. Yield: Serves 6.
  
  *  This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than
  recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first. It also comes
  out very flat -- most of the kugel recipes I've made in the past use
  twice as many noodles in the same size pan. I found that some of the
  things can be increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more
  cottage cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  The following is my favorite brisket recipe and it really does come
  from my Aunt Sadie's kitchen: Remove any excess fat from brisket, but
  leave a little on top. Place one half of the onions on bottom of pan.
  Season the onions with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and lots
  of Hungarian paprika. Place brisket on top of onions, then other half
  of onions and allspice on top of the brisket. Cover and roast in a
  300 degree F. oven for 3 hours.
   Test your brisket and when it is fork tender, take it out. Let it
  cool and then slice it very thin.  Strain juice and either thicken it
  with a little cornstarch or serve it au jus. You will have a very
  dark brown juice. NOTE: Best when made one day in advance.  Aunt
  Sadie almost always served this with savory noodle kugel. I also
  serve it with roasted, boiled or mashed potatoes.  Use a good
  roasting pan with a lit that fits well or covered with heavy duty

      Title: AUNTY BETTY'S BOMBE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Double cream
    1/3 c  Sugar
      4 tb Water
      6 oz Chocolate, plain
      3    Egg yolks
 
  Whisk 1/2 of the cream until stiff and spread it around the edges of a
  large bowl. Freeze for 1/2 to 1 hour.
  
  Dissolve the sugar in the water, bring to the boil and simmer for 3
  minutes until syrupy.  Meanwhile, break chocolate into blender or
  warm bowl.
  
  Pour the hot sugar syrup onto the chocolate and blend or whisk until
  the chocolate has all melted.  Add the egg yolks and mix the whole lot
  thoroughly.
  
  Whisk the remaining cream into soft peaks and fold gently into the
  chocolate mixture. Pour into the centre of the frozen cream and
  freeze for several hours until solid. Cover when fully frozen.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A high-cholesterol chocolate dessert -- This recipe comes from a
  friend's aunt. It always seems to taste wonderful no matter how
  sloppily I measure things. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Although the recipe "serves 4-6," two people will happily eat the
  whole thing.
  
  *  The outside is frozen solid, so you may find a fork useful for
  breaking your portion into pieces without showering fellow diners
  with fragments. It could be served in small portions, but don't count
  on having any left over.
  
  *  Double cream has more than 45 percent butterfat. It is difficult
  to find cream in North America that is richer than whipping cream,
  which is typically 32 percent butterfat. If you can find heavy cream
  it is likely to be 36 percent. Use the richest cream you can find.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

           -intact)
    1/4 c  Butter
      1 c  Orange juice (freshly
           -squeezed)
      2 tb Sherry
      1 ts Orange Zest (grated)

           -(minced)
      1 ts Ginger root (freshly grated)
 
  Soak a dozen long wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Then push
  skewers through prawns, lengthwise, from head to tail with only 1 to
  a skewer.
  
  Combine all ingredients in saucepan and cook over medium to low heat,
  stirring, until butter is completely melted.
  
  Dip skewered prawns in the orange sauce and position on oiled grill
  rack about 4 inches above the coals. Baste liberally with sauce and
  grill for 2 minutes. Turn the prawn over and baste again, cooking for
  another 2 minutes. Smaller prawn will be done at this point, but
  continue basting and turning larger prawn until they are pink and
  cooked through. Remove from heat immediately when done, as they will
  get tough of overcooked. Use any remaining sauce for a dip for the
  prawns.

      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Graham Cracker Crumbs
      6 tb Butter; Melted, *
    1/4 c  Sugar; Granulated

MMMMM-------------------------CHEESECAKE------------------------------
      1 lb Cream Cheese
    1/2 c  Sugar; Granulated
      3    Eggs; Large, Separated
    1/4 c  Unbleached Flour
      1 ts Lemon Rind, Grated
      2 ts Lemon Juice
      1 ts Vanilla Extract
    1/2 c  Heavy Cream
      2 tb Passion Fruit; **
 
  *      Use sweet cream butter and DO NOT substitute margarine. **
  Make the passion fruit pulp from fresh passion fruits or substitute
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- NOTE:  Prebaked crusts are much crisper than the
  chilled ones and this can be important if you want a crisp crust.
  CRUST: If you are prebaking the shell, preheat the oven to 350
  degrees F. Place the crumbs in a mixing bowl and add the butter and
  sugar blending well. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up
  the sides of an 8-inch springform pan. Smooth the mixture to form an
  even layer on the bottom and sides. Bake the crust in the oven for 10
  minutes and let cool to room temperature before filling. NOTE: This
  crust can be chilled for 5 to 10 minutes in the freezer until it is
  set but is not recommended in this recipe. CHEESECAKE: Preheat the
  oven to 300 degrees F.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese
  and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time,
  beating well after each.  Beat in the flour, lemon rind, lemon juice,
  and vanilla until just mixed.  Whip the cream until stiff in a medium
  mixing bowl. Set aside. In another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites
  until they form stiff peaks, then fold them into the cheese mixture.
  Fold in the reserved whipped cream. Stir in the passion fruit pulp
  then pour the mixture into the prepared crust and bake fro 45 minutes
  to 1 hour.
   Cool, in the oven, to room temperature, then chill.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Fish steaks
    1/4 c  Lime juice
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 ts Dijon mustard
      2 ts Fresh ginger root -- grated
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
           Black pepper

  Use Swordfish, Halibut or Salmon steaks.
  
  1. In a bowl, combine the lime juice, 1 tablespoon oil, ginger,
  cayenne pepper and enough freshly ground black pepper to suit your
  taste. 2. Marinate the fish in the marinade for 45-60 minutes. Turn
  steaks 2-3 times. 3. Have the grill prepared with white coals and
  brush the cooking grill with the remaining one tablespoon oil. 4.
  Grill the fish, brushing several times with the marinade, until
  cooked through and opaque in the center. Turn fish after about 4-5
  minutes. Total grilling time will dependon your grill and the heat of

    1/2 ts Salt
      2 oz Beef drippings
           -----pie top-----
      1 pk Puff pastry; (12 oz. size)
      1    Egg yolk
      1 ts Water
 
  Recipe by: Bob Wells #326 <wel@EUROCONTROL.DE> Making the filling:
  Place meat into the pan, stir over low heat until meat is well
  browned. Drain off any surplus fat. Add crumbled stock cubes, water,
  salt, pepper and nutmeg, stir until boiling, reduce heat, cover,
  simmer gently for 20 min, remove from heat.  Combine extra water and
  flour, stir until flour mixture is smooth.  Add flour mixture to
  meat, stir until combined. Return to heat, stir until meat boils and
  thickens. Add soy sauce (to give brown colour), stir until combined.
  Simmer, uncovered, 5 to 10 min; remove from heat allow to become cold.
  
  Making the pie base: Sift flour and salt into basin. Place water and
  dripping into saucepan, stir until dripping melts; remove from heat.
  Make a well in centre of dry ingredients, add liquid, stir until
  combined. (2a. If you're in a hurry, just use premade (bought)
  pastry. It works ok, too. -JN)
  
  Turn out onto lightly floured surface, knead lightly. Roll out pastry
  to line eight greased pie tins.  [We use "real" aluminium 6 or 8 in
  pie casings - JN] Cut excess pastry around sides of pie plates using
  a sharp knife.  Fill centres with cold meat filing.
  
  Pie crust: Roll out puff pastry on lightly floured surface, cut out
  rounds for top of pies, use a saucer as a guide. Wet edges of base
  pastry, and gently press tops into place, trim around edges with a
  sharp knife. Brush tops with combined egg-yolk and water.
  
  Cooking: Bake in hot oven 5 minutes or until golden brown, reduce
  heat to moderate, cook further 10 min.

  This Australian recipe, a very moist cake, not what we'd call a
  pudding, has taken Down Under by storm. you'll find it on restaurant
  and dinner party menus across that country. This version was printed
  recently by the New York times.
  
  TO PREPARE CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch round
  baking pan withsides at least 2 inches high, such as a springform pan.
  
  Place the dates in a saucepan and cover with water (about 1-1/2 cups).
  Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Add the
  baking soda (the mixture will foam) and set aside.
  
  In a bowl, cream the cut up butter, sugar and eggs, adding the eggs
  one at a time. Gently mix in the flour, salt and vanilla. Stowly stir
  in the baking powder and 1/4 cup of the liquid from cooking the
  dates, until the cake mixture resembles thick pancake batter. Drain
  off remainder of date cooking liquid and discard. Stir in the dates.
  
  Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked in the center.
  
  TO PREPARE CARAMEL SAUCE: Combine the butter, whipping cream, brown
  sugar and vanilla. Bring to a boil; reduce to simmer, and cook for 3
  minutes.
  
  TO SERVE: Drizzle some of the sauce over the cake as it is cooling.
  Serve the rest of the sauce separately.

      Title: AUSTRIAN BREAD DUMPLINGS
 Categories: Ethnic, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 oz Dry bread, diced
    1/2 oz (1 Tbsp) butter or lard
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Milk
      3 oz (3/4 cup) flour
           Salt and pepper
      1 tb Chopped fresh herbs
           -(parsley, chervil,
           -marjoram) -
 
  1 Tbsp     chopped fresh herbs (parsley, chervil, marjoram) -
  optional, but a great improvement
  
  You will need a frying pan, a large and a small bowl, and a saucepan
  of water or soup.  Fry the diced bread lightly in the fat in a frying
  pan. Meanwhile, mix the egg and the milk in a small bowl. Tip the
  contents of the frying pan into a large bowl, and pour the egg and
  milk over all. Stir in the flour, and season with salt and pepper.
  Add the herbs, if using. You may need more milk to make a soft dough.
  Allow it to stand for 1/2 an hour.
  
  Dip your hand into cold water and roll the mixture into a dozen small
  balls.  Put a pot of salted water on to boil, if there isn't a
  simmering soup pot waiting. Drop little balls of dough into the
  boiling salted water or the soup.  Poach them for 10 to 15 minutes,
  until they are light and firm and well risen.
  
  Yield:  12 dumplings Time: 1 hour
  
  Notes:  You may include chopped fried bacon or cubed pork cracklings
  in the mixture.  Leaving out flour will result in a lighter dumpling.

      Title: AUSTRIAN HOMESTYLE GENERIC VEGETABLE SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter or margarine (or oil,
           -or lard)
      3 tb All purpose flour
  1 1/2 pt Water
  3 1/2 ts Knorr Beef Flavor Consomme
           -Mix (or similar bouillon
           Powder or cubes)
      2 tb Chopped onion
      1 md Carrot, diced
      2 c  (approx.) broccoli or
           -cauliflower, cut into small
           -pieces
      1 md Potato, peeled and diced
 
  Melt butter over medium heat.  Add flour, stirring constantly, until
  the mixture becomes puffy.  Add water, bouillon powder, onions,
  potatoes and carrots. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce
  heat and simmer until potatoes are almost done (about 5 to 6
  minutes). Add broccoli and return to boil.  Simmer for another minute.
  
  Makes 3 large servings (which with a chunk of French bread or the like
  would make a hearty meal, quantity-wise.)
  
  VARIATIONS:  For thinner soup, use less flour.  For vegetables with a
  more delicate flavor, use less bouillon powder. If using sliced
  mushrooms, asparagus and frozen or fresh green peas as vegetables,
  use slightly less flour, slightly less bouillon powder, and a dash of
  sugar. (Start with the asparagus, adding peas and mushrooms when
  asparagus is almost done. No onion in that one, BTW, it would
  overwhelm the other flavors.) If all you've got is potatoes and
  onions, add quarter teaspoon caraway seeds early on (when you reduce
  to simmering). What, not even potatoes? Throw in somewhat more
  chopped onion and add rice, and serve with fresh chopped parsley.

      Title: AUTHENTIC CAROLINA PORK BARBEQUE
 Categories: Pork & ham, Bar-b-q
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Pork butt (shoulder)
      1 ga Cider vinegar
     10 oz Worcestershire sauce
      6 oz Chili sauce
  1 1/4 oz Crushed red pepper flakes
 
  Mix all sauce ingredients together.  Use as a basting sauce for the
  meat.
  
  The pork has to be barbecued - that is, cooked long and slow over a
  real wood fire, preferably hickory. Temp should be around 220
  degrees, and it takes at least 1-1/2 hours per pound, or until
  internal temp. reaches 150-160 degrees.  Needless to say, this is
  difficult to accomplish in the average backyard Weber kettle,
  although it can be done. It has to be served on a CWB:  Cheap White
  Bun.  After that, the only question is "with or without?" Sweet cole
  slaw on top, that is.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  First, make a soft, rich custard: beat 4 egg yolks until light and
  pale yellow.  Heat 2 cups light cream with 1/4 cup sugar and 1
  tablespoon orange flower water or vanilla. Add beaten egg yolks,
  while beating very hard. Then cook without boiling, stirring
  continuously until custard coats the spoon.  Remove to a bowl. Cover
  and refrigerate until well chilled. Cut a two-layer sponge cake (that
  you bake or buy) into finger-length pieces. Spread each one on one
  side with raspberry jam and quickly dip in 1/2 cup sherry. Place half
  these sponge fingers in the bottom of a deep cut-glass bowl. Cover
  with half the custard. Whip 2 cups cream. Sweeten with 1/2 cup icing
  sugar and vanilla to taste. Cover custard with half the whipped
  cream.  Make a second layer on top of all this. Top with a dozen or
  so toasted almonds, standing them upright in the cream, add a few
  slivers of angelica - or use small roses instead of almonds and
  angelica. Refrigerate at least 12 hours. This beautiful dessert never
  fails to create a sensation, yet is easy to prepare.

      Title: AUTHENTIC ITALIAN BREAD
 Categories: Italian, Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 ts Active dry yeast or 1/3
           -small cake (6 grams) fresh
           -yeast
      1    Scant tsp. malt syrup
    1/3 c  Warm water
    2/3 c  Milk at room temperature
      1 c  (135 grams) unbleached
           -all-purpose flour
 
  This takes 2 days but is worth the wait. Makes 2 round loaves Starter
  
  Stir the yeast and malt into the water; let stand until foamy, about
  10 minutes. Stir in the milk and beat in the flour with a rubber
  spatula or wooden spoon about 100 strokes until smooth. Cover with
  plastic wrap and let stand until bubbly, at least 4 hours but
  preferably overnight.
  
  Dough 2 cups water, at room temperature 6 1/4 cups (860 grams)
  unbleached all-purpose flour 1 T. salt Cornmeal
  
  Mix the starter and the water in a mixer until the starter is well
  broken up. Add the flour and salt and mix for 2 to 3 minutes at low
  speed. The dough will be smooth but won't pull away from the side of
  the bowl. Change to the dough hook and knead at medium speed,
  scraping down the side of the bowl as necessary, until the dough is
  elastic but slightly sticky, 3 to 4 minutes. Finish kneading by hand
  on a floured work surface.
  
  First rise Place in a well-oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic
  wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. The dough is
  ready when it is very bubbled and blistered.
  
  Shaping and second rise Cut the dough in half on a floured surface and
  shape into 2 round loaves. Place on an oiled cookie sheet sprinkled
  with cornmeal. Cover and let rise till doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  Baking Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake about 1 hour and cool on
  racks. To get a really good crust spray the loaves with water 3 times
  in the first 15 minutes of baking.

      Title: AUTHENTIC SOUTHERN STYLE BARBECUED RIBS (SECR
 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------SECRET SAUCE-----------------------------
      1    Bottle ketchup, 32 ounce
           -large size (Heinz is my
           -favorite)
    2/3 sm Jar prepared yellow mustard
           -(ie. French's)
    1/2 lb Dark brown sugar
    1/3 lg Onion, chopped coarsely
      3 tb Distilled white vinegar
      2 lg Lemons, sliced
           Tabasco hot sauce to taste
           -(3 drops to 1/2 ts)
           Ground black pepper to
           -taste (lots of it)
           No salt (plenty in the
           -ketchup)
 
  Preparation time:  1/2 day, but constant attention is not required.
  
  Simmer the sauce, stirring until the sugar is melted. Then, stir
  occasionally for a few minutes while the oil is drawn out of the
  lemon. Do not allow to scorch. Remove from heat and set aside.
  
  Broil the ribs flesh side up until browned.  Turn and cook flesh side
  down, brown again.  Now brush both sides with some of the sauce and
  cook on each side for five minutes. Do not let them burn or blacken!
  The RIBS at this point look good, but they are still raw.
  
  Cut the ribs apart and dip each rib in the sauce. Pile the ribs high
  on a full-sized oven broiler rack and pan, and pour any remaining
  sauce, less a cup or so, over the ribs.
  
  Cover the ribs with heavy-duty aluminium foil, tucking in around the
  outside edge of the pan to make an airtight container. Cook in the
  oven at 325F for 2 hours.
  
  Remove from oven and open very carefully.  Beware the live steam that
  will rush out.  Allow to sit, opened for a few minutes.
  
  The end result is smoked, steamed, tender meat which falls from the
  bones. All fat is rendered and drains into the pan.
  
  Use leftover sauce when warming over the second day.
  
  SAUCE VARIATION: Molasses, tomato paste, onion, spices
  
  Unfortunately I don't have anyplace to grill outdoors so can first
  part of the recipe (which calls for outdoor grilling) be substituted
  by putting the ribs in the oven?
  
  Rinse and dry ribs; then cut apart.  Heat about 3 cups oil in a wok.
  When very hot, add ribs in small batches and fry until brown and
  crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove and drain.
  
  [They are absolutely delicious at this point.  Once I forgot to make
  the sauce until I was half done eating the ribs! They're great served
  at this point with various Chinese dips ++mustard with a dish of
  chopped scallions, hoisin sauce, chili sauces, etc.  S.C.]
  
  Combine sugar, vinegar, salt and soy sauce.  Remove oil from wok;
  return wok to stove and turn heat to high. When hot, add vinegar
  mixture. Cook, stirring, over high heat until syrupy. Add ribs; toss
  in the mixture until well coated.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  San Francisco Chronicle, date unknown...
  
  I have never tried that, but I suspect a compromise could be worked.
  Most of the actual cooking occurs during the oven portion. The
  purpose of the outdoor grilling is to both sear and seal the meat,
  and impart the unique flavor of barbecue to the ribs by exposing it
  to the smoke created when the drippings from the meat vaporize on the
  hot briquets. An additional (and desirable) flavor is also imparted
  to the meat if real charcoal briquets are used.
  
  The addition of the "Secret Sauce" during the last portion of the
  outdoor phase also contributes to the taste.
  
  As a non-outside alternative, I would suggest oven broiling of the
  ribs as a substitute for the outdoor searing. During the final
  portion, the coating of the slabs could still be done (the 5 minutes
  per side part).
  
  To possibly aid in giving a barbecue-like flavor, a drop or two of
  liquid smoke could be added **only** to the small portion of the
  sauce that is used to coat the ribs during the searing process.
  There's a possibility the time under the broiler may need to be
  shortened when compared with the outside method.
  
  Liquid smoke is a very potent ingredient, and I have never found it
  satisfactory for my own use. Obviously, some must, as it is still
  sold. As a rule of thumb, I would advise forgetting about the amount
  recommended for use on the bottle, and if in doubt, "use less". Then,
  following the oven broiling, you can continue by cutting the ribs
  apart, and continuing by the recipe.

 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text recipe
 
  Make a marinade of yoghurt, lime juice, chilli powder or paprika, five
  spice powder (we would used "garam masala" which is a powder of
  cloves, cinnamon, bay leaf, cardamom, nutmeg and pepper corns) paste
  of green chillis, ginger-garlic paste, a pinch of red food colouring
  and salt. Marinate it for at least three to four hours (leaving it
  overnight would be best). Then heat your oven, pop the chicken pieces
  in an oven-proof dish, pour in a little of the marinade and for the
  effect of the "tandoor" place a piece of live-coal in your oven (it
  gives a wonderful aroma). It takes around 10-15 minutes to get done
  but around half way open the oven and brush the chicken with oil.
  Make sure not to overdo it. It should be just done for the chicken to
  be nice and succulent. When it is nice and dry serve it on a bed of
  lettuce with lemon wedges (which could also be squeesed on the
  chicken before serving) and a sprig of parsley.
  
  Tandoori is a style of cooking which is close to grilling. In olden
  times it used to be done in big clay pots which used to be put under
  the ground for the meat to cook..but now we have "tandoors" or ovens
  could be used too.

      Title: AUTHENTIC TEX-MEX FAJITAS
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Beef skirt steak
    1/2    Onion; halved, slice thin
      2 ts Ground cumin
      2 ts Powdered red chiles
      3    Jalapenos; (pickled) chopped
      2    Cl Garlic; chopped
    1/4 c  Lime juice
      2 tb Jalapeno pickling liquid; *
      1 tb Corn oil
      1 tb Soy sauce; (optional)
      1 ts Liquid smoke; (optional)
 
  This is the liquid used to pickle and flavor the jalapenos. It is
  basically white vinegar with added spices, and there is always ample
  liquid in the jar or can to use in this recipe, without leaving the
  remaining jalapenos dry.
  
   1. Place half of the onions in the bottom of a nonreactive dish. Mix
  the cumin, powdered red chiles, chopped jalapenos and garlic together
  in a small bowl, then rub on all sides of the meat. Put the skirt
  steak into the dish, on top of the onions. Pour the lime juice and
  the jalapeno liquid over all areas to coat. Sprinkle the remaining
  onions on top of the meat. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour, but
  preferably overnight, turning once.
  
   2. Preheat the grill or broiler until hot. Fajitas need to cook
  close to a very high heat source, in order to sear the outside but
  still leave the interior medium rare. Mix together the oil and, if
  you are using them, the soy sauce and liquid smoke. Brush or spoon
  the oil mixture onto the meat surfaces. Grill or broil about 2 to 3
  minutes on each side, or until the outside is brown and slightly
  charred, and the inside is still slightly pink.
  
   3. Remove the meat to a cutting board. Let sit 5 minutes before
  slicing. Cut the meat into thin strips that can be easily rolled into
  tortillas. Serve with warm, soft flour tortillas and fresh Pico de
  Gallo or Salsa Fresca.
  
  NOTES:
  
  Fajitas are pure Tex-Mex food. They originated along the Rio Grande
  River on the Texas-Mexico border and were eaten by cattle wranglers.
  The skirt steak is the traditional cut used and was reserved
  primarily for the chief cowboy. Other cuts of beef can be
  substituted, such as flank steak or sirloin, but the skirt is by far
  the most tender, flavorful and authentic.
  
  You might be wondering where the cast-iron griddle with the sizzling
  bell peppers and onions are in this recipe. While such a serving
  method may be dramatic, it is an affectation developed mainly by
  chain restaurants and is in no way a part of true Tex-Mex fajitas.
  You may go ahead and add it, but I am still partial to the clean,
  simple taste of hot grilled meat topped solely with fresh tomato
  salsa and blanketed in warm, soft tortillas. I do make two minor
  additions in my recipe when oven-broiling: I add soy sauce to help
  the thinly cut steaks brown quicker, and I use bottled "liquid smoke"
  to replicate the flavors created by the more desirable method of
  charcoal-grilling. Otherwise, this recipe is as authentic as it gets.

      1 lb Light brown sugar
 
  Mix the fruit and vegetables together.  Put into an preserving pan
  (Note: these books call for an aluminum pan - I just don't use
  aluminum with acid food )  Add the remaining ingredients, except the
  sugar. Simmer for about 30 minutes until tender. Add the sugar and
  stir until dissolved. Simmer gently, stirring frequently, until
  thick. (Note: how long this takes depends on the water content of the
  fruits). Cool, then pack the chutney into clean jars.  Cover and
  seal. PS: I always refrigerate after opening the jar. "Gathering the
  produce of the season as the days shorten, as the sun travels lower
  in the sky and the earth quietens, is a deeply satisfying pastime.
  Making the most of the produce is a pleasure, too, and this chutney
  brings several of the fruits of the season together in a
  mouthwatering way.

     12 lg Garlic cloves, peeled

      4 tb Oregano, dried

      1 c  Apricots, dried
      1 c  Green olives, pitted
    1/2 c  Capers (plus a bit
           -of the juice)
      8    Bay leaves
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  White wine, dry
      4 tb Italian parsley (chopped)
 
  Clean hens well under cold water.  Pat dry.
  
  In a large bowl, combine hens, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper,
  vinegar, oil, prunes, apricots, olives, capers (with juice) and bay
  leaves. Cover and refrigerate overnight to marinate.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Arrange game hens in 1 or 2 shallow
  roasting pans. Spoon all the marinade over the hens. Sprinkle evenly
  with brown sugar and pour wine around them. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4
  hours, basting frequently, until golden. Juice should look clear when
  thigh is pricked with a fork. Transfer hens, fruit, olives and capers
  to a serving platter. Moisten with pan juices and sprinkle with
  parsley. Pass remaining pan juices in a sauce boat.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cornish game hens stewed in fruit and sugar -- I originally got
  this recipe from the Sunday magazine of the local paper. I served it
  last year for Christmas dinner, and it's very good. What's more, this
  recipe is easy: you just put everything in a bowl, marinate
  overnight, then bake until done!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      2    Pouch liquid pectin
      6    Canning jars
 
     Remove stems veins and most of the seeds of peppers and chiles.
     Adding the seeds of 1 jalapeno chile will not make the jelly
  
     hotter since the sugar, the vinegar, and the cooking
     process tame (most) all the chiles. The floatin
     seeds in the jar add character.
  
     Using the knife blade of a processor, mince the
     peppers and chiles with quick on and off pulsations.
  
     In a 5 qt. pot, mix the peppers, chiles, seeds sugar
     and vinegar.  Bring to a rolling boil and boil for
     3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool for 5
     minutes.  Add the 6 ozs of pectin (certo) and stir
     continuously for 2 minutes.  Allow the mixture to cool
     for another 2 minutes and the stir again for 1 minute.
     This stirring will distribute the bits of pepper
     throughout the jelly.  Pour into jelly jars that
     have been strilized and seal immediatly with lids
     that have been sterilized seperatly for 5 minutes.
     Test seal, after cooling, with finger.  If middle
     pops up when pressed, jar is not sealed.

      Title: AVGOLEMONO (GREEK EGG & LEMON SAUCE)
 Categories: Sauces, Cheese/eggs, Fruits, Greek
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lg Eggs
           Juice Of 1 Lemon (About 1/4
           -cup)
  1 1/2 c  Well Seasoned Chicken Stock
 
  Avgolemono is easy to make and creates quit a stir at a formal dinner
  party.  It is an almost ethereal sauce, light, foamy, and a beautiful
  pale yellow color. It is a great accompaniment to roasted meat or
  chicken, or poached fish, and it is heartily recommended for boiled
  artichokes. Add another cup of chicken stock and serve this as a
  perfect first course soup.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until lemon
  colored and frothy, then beat in the lemon juice until the mixture is
  very foamy. Whisk in the hot stock a little at a time until the sauce
  is light in color and foamy.  Serve immediately.
  
  Yield: About 2 cups

      Title: AVOCADO & POTATO SALAD WITH HORSERADISH
 Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Salads, Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Salad
 
      2 lb New potatoes; scrubbed
    1/4 c  Olive oil
  1 1/2 tb Red wine vinegar
           Salt
    1/2 c  Sour cream
    1/2 c  Plain yogurt
      2 tb Prepared horseradish
    1/4 c  Fresh dill sprigs
           -- loosely packed
           -- thick stems removed
      3    Celery ribs; strings removed
           -- cut in 1/4" crescents
           -- (1 cup)
      2 md Avocados* or 1 lg. avocado
      1 tb Lime juice; freshly squeezed
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  *Choose avocados that are firm, with just a slight give. If the
  avocado is soft enough to hold an indentation, it's overripe and
  won't have the rich nutty flavor that you want for this salad.
  
  Bring water to a boil in the bottom of a vegetable steamer. Cut
  potatoes in half; place them in the steamer basket. Cover and steam
  until they are cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove the potatoes
  from the heat and allow them to cool slightly.
  
  While potatoes are cooking, whisk oil and vinegar together in a large
  bowl. Season to taste with salt; set aside. When potatoes are cool
  enough to handle without burning your fingers, cut them in 1" cubes.
  Toss them in the oil and vinegar so they are coated well, and set
  them aside to cool to room temperature, tossing occasionally.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, yogurt and
  horseradish. Mince the dill and add it to the sour cream mixture,
  stirring well.
  
  When potatoes have cooled to room temperature, add celery and toss to
  combine.  Then add the sour cream mixture; toss again.
  
  Halve, pit and peel the avocados.  Cut them into 1" cubes; place in a
  small bowl with the lime juice. Toss so the cubes are moistened with
  the juice. Then add the avocados, with all of the lime juice, to the
  potatoes; toss gently until they are well distributed and coated with
  the dressing. Add pepper and additional salt to taste, and either
  serve immediately or chill for 30 minutes and then serve.
  
  While Loomis says that this salad does not keep well and shouldn't be
  counted on for leftovers, she says that it's one of the most popular
  potato salads she's ever made.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

  until they are cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove the potatoes
  from the heat and allow them to cool slightly.
  
  While potatoes are cooking, whisk oil and vinegar together in a large
  bowl. Season to taste with salt; set aside. When potatoes are cool
  enough to handle without burning your fingers, cut them in 1" cubes.
  Toss them in the oil and vinegar so they are coated well, and set
  them aside to cool to room temperature, tossing occasionally.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, yogurt and
  horseradish. Mince the dill and add it to the sour cream mixture,
  stirring well.
  
  When potatoes have cooled to room temperature, add celery and toss to
  combine.  Then add the sour cream mixture; toss again.
  
  Halve, pit and peel the avocados.  Cut them into 1" cubes; place in a
  small bowl with the lime juice. Toss so the cubes are moistened with
  the juice. Then add the avocados, with all of the lime juice, to the
  potatoes; toss gently until they are well distributed and coated with
  the dressing. Add pepper and additional salt to taste, and either
  serve immediately or chill for 30 minutes and then serve.
  
  While Loomis says that this salad does not keep well and shouldn't be
  counted on for leftovers, she says that it's one of the most popular
  potato salads she's ever made.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

    1/2 ts Ground Coriander -- ** see

      6 fl Oz Single (Light) Cream
      3 tb Plain Yoghurt
           Salt And Freshly Ground
           Black Pepper -- to taste
      2    To 3 Avocados
 
  * shallots work just as well, although you need more ** we really like
  coriander, so we put in a couple of teaspoons
  
  Melt butter in a saucepan, add spring onions and stir-fry 1 minute.
  Then add orange and lemon peel and coriander. Remove from the heat
  while you prepare cream and yoghurt. Pour cream into a small bowl and
  add yoghurt, salt and pepper. Mix well until smooth. Peel, stone and
  chop avocados (the size you chop the pieces is personal preference,
  but we usually chop into about 1.5 cm cubes).  Add the avocado to the
  ingredients in the pan, pour yoghurt mixture over and very gently
  heat through. DO NOT BOIL or avocados will become soggy and sauce
  will curdle.  Pour over pasta, toss and serve at once.
  
  Note:  This sauce can be started in advance but the avocados should
  not be added until the last minute.
  
  For the two of us for dinner, we halve all of the ingredients, and
  use one medium to large sized avocado.

    1/4 c  Cilantro leaves, very finely
           Minced
      1 ts Ground Coriander
           Salt
      1 bn Radishes, 10-12
           Black pepper
 
   Heat the Avocado oil or two tablespoons of the olive oil in a
  saucepan and add chopped onion. Saute for 5 minutes and add garlic,
  ginger and 2 of the peppers. Saute for another 5 minutes. Add the
  stock, simmer for 10 minutes and remove from heat.
   While the stock and vegetables are simmering, cut the Avocados in
  half and seed and peel them. Chop the Avocados, toss them with the
  juice of 1 lime and place about half the Avocado in a blender
  container. Add hot stock and vegetables until container is about 3/4
  full and process until the mixture is smooth and liquid. Chill the
  soup thoroughly, preferably for several hours.
   To make the cilantro cream, stir the sour cream and half-and-half
  together, add the chopped cilantro, the remaining chili pepper, the
  ground coriander and salt to taste. Chill until you are ready to use
  it.
   Cut the radishes in small julienne and toss with the walnut oil or
  the remaining olive oil, the juice of 1/2 lime and salt to taste.
  Chill until you are ready to use them.
   Taste the chilled soup and add salt and more lime juice to taste.
  Ladle it into chilled soup bowls. Top each serving with a tablespoon
  of cilantro cream and a tablespoon of julienned radishes.
  
  Variation This soup is also delicious when served hot and is an ideal
  opening to a hearty Mexican meal.

      4    Hard-cooked eggs *
    1/4 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Strained fresh lime juice
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 lb Smoked whitefish
      2 lg Ripe avocados
     12    Strips of fresh red bell
           -pepper or canned
           -pimiento **
 
  * the yolks rubbed through a sieve and the whites finely chopped.
  
  ** each cut about 1/4 inch wide and 2 inches long.
  
  In a deep bowl, mash the egg yolks and milk together with a spoon or
  table fork until they form a smooth paste. Add 1 tablespoon of the
  lime juice, the sugar and the salt.
  
  Then beat in the vegetable oil, a teaspoon or so at a time; make sure
  each addition is absorbed before adding more. Add the olive oil by
  teaspoonfuls, beating constantly.  Stir the remaining lime juice into
  the sauce and taste for seasoning.
  
  With your fingers or a small knife, remove the skin from the fish and
  pick out any bones.  Drop the fish into a bowl and flake it finely
  with a fork. Add the chopped egg whites and the sauce, and toss
  together gently but thoroughly.
  
  Just before serving, cut the avocados in half.  With the tip of a
  small knife, loosen the seeds and lift them out. Remove any brown
  tissue like fibers clinging to the flesh.
  
  Spoon the fish mixture into the avocado halves, dividing it equally
  among them and mounding it slightly in the center. Arrange 3 strips
  of sweet pepper or pimiento diagonally across the top of each avocado
  and serve at once.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

 Categories: Appetizers, Fruits
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           --Terrine Mix--
      4    Avocado peeled, seeded
           -mashed.
      2 ts Dijon Mustard
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
           Lemons to Squeeze
    1/2 pt Whipping Cream
      1    Avocado peeled, rubbed with
           -lemon and sliced 1/2 inch
           -thick.
           --Sauce--
      3    Medium or 4 Large ripe
           -plum tomatoes, peeled and
           -seeded
           Squeeze of Lemon Juice
      1 oz Heavy Cream
           Fresh Basil
           --Garnish--
      3    Medium shrimp per serving.
           -peeled, deveined, lightly
           -poached.
      2    Basil Leaves (whole)
 
   As you cut avocados drizzle lemon juice on them so that they will not
  darken. Mash avocados in a bowl and add the mustard and worcestershire
  sauce. In a separate bowl lightly whip the 1/2 pint of whipping
  cream. The cream should be a little loose, soft peak stage is the
  technical term. Fold cream into avocado mixture.
   Place parchment paper in a standard bread pan so that there is enough
  paper to cover the top of the filled terrine. Spray the parchment with
  release spray. Fill the terrine with 1/2 of the mixture, and
  refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove terrine from refrigerator,
  slice the extra avocado and drizzle lemon juice on it to keep it from
  darkening, place the slices on the top of the chilled mixture. Pour
  other 1/2 of the avocado melange on top. Drizzle some lemon juice on
  top and fold parchment paper over top. Refrigerate for 35 to 40
  minutes. While the terrine is chilling, peel devein and barely poach
  the shrimp, let the shrimp cool in the poaching liquid if possible.
  Set the shrimp aside for the garnish. Separate nice looking basil
  leaves for garnish.
   Prepare the sauce; roughly cut the tomato into bite size pieces,
  place in a small frying pan or saucepan and stew them slightly. Add a
  little lemon juice and the cream, mix in a few stray leaves of the
  basil cut into strips. The goal is to quickly cook off some of the
  liquid. Let this sauce cool to room temperature or below before
  saucing the dishes.
   To unmold, sit the terrine in some warm water for 1 minute or less,
  and unmold onto a platter. Slice into 3/4 inch thick pieces and place
  the shrimp and basil on the plate with the terrine. Spoon some of the
  basil rich sauce over the top.

  :          roughly chopped
        6 c  milk -- up to 8 cups
  :          Salt and pepper
      1/2 c  sour cream
        1 ts chipotle chile -- pureed
  
  1. Steam or boil the potatoes until soft and let cool. Meanwhile,
  roast, peel, and seed the poblanos. Roast the tomatillos and onions
  until lightly charred.
  
  2. Combine the roasted vegetables and potatoes in a food processor or
  blender and puree. Add the serrano chile, cilantro, mint, lime juice,
  ginger, and avocado and puree until smooth, adding milk as necessary
  to facilitate the blending. Transfer to a bowl or storage container

  3. Taste the chilled soup for seasoning and correct if necessary. Mix
  the sour cream and chipotle chile together and drizzle over each bowl
  soup as a garnish.

  gently and served warm.  If you prefer it less spicy, leave out the
  chipotle garnish and simply garnish with a sprig cilantro. Serves 8
  to 10
  
  "The avocado in this soup turns a traditional potato-based soup into
  something the French would never recognize! Because of the richness
  of the avocado, we can use milk instead of cream without compromising
  the texture." Source: Contemporary Southwest, The Terra Cotta

      Title: AVOCADO WITH CRAB
 Categories: Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4    Ripe avocados
     15 oz Crab meat or
      1 lb Fresh crab meat
      8    Tb mayonnaise
      4    To 6 drops Worcestershire
           -sauce
    1/2 c  Finely minced, peeled
           -celery stalks
           Salt, depending on the
           -saltiness of the crab meat
      1 pn White pepper
      1 pn Cayenne or
      1 dr To 2 drops Tabasco
      1    Head iceberg lettuce
      2    Lemons
 
  1.  Split the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pits. With a
  melon-ball cutter, gently enlarge the cavity toward the stem end.
  
  2.  With a fork, mash the avocado pulp which was removed.
  
  3.  Mix the pulp with 4 tbs. of the mayonnaise, salt if needed,
  pepper and cayenne or Tabasco.  Gently fold in the crab meat and the
  celery.
  
  4.  Divide the crab mixture among the eight avocado halves.
  
  5.  Mix the Worcestershire sauce with the remaining 4 tbs.
  mayonnaise. With a pastry bag or a cone made from wax paper, pipe
  approximately 1/2 tbs. of the mayonnaise mixture on each filled
  avocado half.
  
  6.  Remove the outside leaves of the iceberg lettuce. Arrange the
  leaves on a serving platter.  Cut the inside part of the lettuce into
  very thin strips and make 8 small nests on the leaves lining the
  serving platter. Place an avocado half on each nest.
  
  7.  Cut each lemon in quarters and garnish the serving platter with
  the slices of lemon.  Serve.  If desired, offer additional mayonnaise
  separately.
  
  CHEF'S SECRET:  When you buy avocados, they should not be soft but, if
  pressed gently, should give about the same resist-ance as an orange.
  Once at home, pack each avocado in a brown paper bag and leave them
  at room temperature overnight.  Of course, chill before serving.
  
  If you use canned crab meat, it is advisable to pick it over.
  Sometimes you may find a small piece of the shell. Definitely taste
  it for saltiness. Certain brands improve with a quick rinsing with
  water.
  
  If you have to rinse it, don't do it under the faucet. Place the meat
  in a sieve and dip the sieve in a small amount of water. Loosen the
  meat with one finger, then remove the sieve from the water and shake
  the meat dry. The flavor will not be destroyed, but the saltiness of
  the canning liquid will be gone.
  
  Enlarging the cavity of the avocados with a melon-ball cutter has two
  purposes; you have the subtle taste of the pulp in the crab mixture,
  and it is easier to arrange the filling without making it messy.
  
  Definitely peel the celery stalks for this dish with a potato peeler
  so that no strings get into the salad. The celery is needed for its
  crunchy texture to counterbalance the softness of the avocado and
  mayonnaise and the fleshy chewiness of the crab meat. If you do not
  care for the taste of celery, you can substitute peeled, seeded,
  finely chopped cucumber.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: AVOCADO WITH MUSHROOM FILLING (VEGAN)
 Categories: Appetizers, Spreads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    175 g  Button mushrooms
           -- minced in the blender
      3 tb Pesto sauce
      1 lg Ripe avocado
           -- cut in half and stoned
           Lettuce leaves to garnish
 
  Mincing fresh raw mushrooms in the blender takes a few seconds only,
  and gives a better texture for this dish than chopping them by hand.
  Mixed with pesto sauce and heaped into the cavity of a ripe avocado,
  this makes a delectable starter.
  
  Steam the minced mushrooms for 3 minutes. Cool, and drain off the
  juices. Mix the mushrooms with the pesto and place inside the hollow
  of the avocado halves. Place on a bed of lightly dressed lettuce
  leaves to serve (see Dressings).

  as an appetizer. Mrs. Neel Garland.

  Oven-Crisp Tortilla Chips:  Here's an easy way to make your own

  with kitchen shears or a knife. Place the wedges on an ungreased
  baking sheet and toast in a 350F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or till
  dry and crisp. You'll find they're sturdy for dipping, there's no
  messy cleanup, and the chips are lower in calories than those you buy
  in the store.

 Categories: Manual, Mm, Lesson, Basics
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B
 
  Some errors that stop imports are very difficult to see and others are
  really quite easy.  When you try to import IMPORT.ER1* or you import
  manually you got some error messages; the most common and frightening
  is "@ing at or before line #.." And you LOOK and just don't see
  ANYTHING. Well there IS something there that is not correct...and
  here is a list and examples of the most common errors.
  
   1. The difference between l (the LETTER) and 1 (the NUMBER) is
  slight but MM accepts only NUMBERS in the quantity column.
  
   2. A backwards slant 1\2 is INCORRECT...1/2 is fine.
  
   3. A range of numbers is a NO NO...4-6 eggs won't do; pick 5...
  
   4. The two digits in the UNIT OF MEASUREMENT column should include
  ONLY LETTERS.  When in that column, hit F1 for a complete list of the
  only acceptable abbreviations.
  
   5. Be sure that all the units of measure start on the ninth column.
  (9 spaces from the left)
  
   6. The ingredient column can be only 39 columns long.
  
  Once you get used to these common errors your eye will pick it up
  quickly. I hope this helps...
  
  *NOTE:   "IMPORT.ER1 is the file that MM creates (when you choose that
  option) to copy your flawed recipes.
   The  ones that download with errors. Sometimes it is difficult to
  SEE what is wrong with them. This 'recipe' helps you pick up the
  common errors.

  Heat olive oil in large skillet till water sizzles. Add 1/2 diced
  green pepper, 1/2 diced onion, 1 to 2 crushed & diced cloves garlic,
  and a couple chopped large tomatoes (peeled if you prefer). You can
  also add other veggies if you wish.  After they saute for about 5
  minutes, add one cup tomato sauce, 1/2 cup red or white wine (or
  stock, or water from the cooking pasta), and 1/2 cup cream (or milk).
  Flavor with a sprinkle of oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Turn down
  heat and simmer about 5 minutes. Serve over pasta. This sauce is
  quite different from the normal cook-all-day sauces; it is more fresh
  and vibrant, but not as complex. It will accomodate almost any
  vegetable you choose to add. Try eggplant or broccoli or asparagus,
  just to name a few.

    1/2 c  Mayonnaise
    1/2 c  Sour cream
    1/2 c  Thousand island dressing
      2 tb Horseradish; grated
 
  Select a well-rounded onion.  Peel outer skin off. Leave root intact;
  cut off any hanging roots.  Using small, sharp fnife, divide onion
  into four sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the top
  and cutting toward root, stopping about 1/2 inch away. Cut each
  section twice. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to cover
  it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or "petals" will begin to
  open. Remove onion from hot water and immerse into ice water, to help
  the opening. Drain well by turning opside down on paper towel. Put
  flour into paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat with flour.
  Roll floured onion in beaten egg to cover. Put cracker crumbs or
  coating mix in paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat.
  Refrigerate for 1 hour before deep frying in oil to golden brown, 3
  to 5 minutes. Cooked onion may be kept for a time in warm oven. The
  "Outback Steakhouse" serves this with a delicious hot-hot sauce to
  dunk' in. They also add hot spices to the flour and/or coating mix.

  from oven, and put the cake into the fridge (after it cools) for
  about 8 hours.
  
  Top with fruit- cherry pie filling, fresh or frozen strawberries,
  etc., then with a dollop of whipped cream.

      Title: AYALLA'S BANANA BREAD
 Categories: Quick bread
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      3    Bananas, very ripe
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Shortening (butter)
      2    Eggs
      3 tb Yoghurt or sour cream
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Walnuts, chopped
           Rum, vanilla, or amaretto
           -(optional)
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream the shortening and sugar.
  Mix in the bananas.  Mix in the remaining ingredients. Pour into a
  greased loaf pan. Bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This recipe is from my friend Ayalla -- It makes a heavy, but
  moist, loaf of banana bread.
  
  *  If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you
  lower the oven temperature and cook for a while longer. Otherwise,
  the crust comes out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist
  and almost undercooked.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  Preparation:  10 minutes; baking:  at least 95 minutes.
  Allow some time for cooling.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: AYAM GERENG (INDONESIAN FRIED CHICKEN)
 Categories: Indonesian, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 md Chicken

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Tamarind water
      1 tb Clear soya sauce
           A pinch of chilli powder
      1 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Ground coriander
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
           A pinch of turmeric
 
  The name means simply 'fried chicken', and that is all it is. The
  marinade, however, gives it a characteristically Indonesian flavour.
  Marinate the pieces of chicken in this mixture for 2 hours, turning
  them from time to time. Strain the chicken, so that the marinade
  drips away from it. Then deep-fry the portions, 4 or 5 at a time.
  Chicken fried in this way is excellent with Nasi Goreng.  [Nasi
  Goreng is fried rice. S.C.] Makes 4 servings. From "Indonesian Food
  and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London, 1986." ISBN

  * Available at Asian markets and in the Asian section of some
  supermarkets. If you can't find them don't worry, the recipe will
  still work OK.
  
  The Javanese seem to like their chicken pretty well done and chewy. I
  prefer mine a little more tender and fry it for a bit less than ten
  minutes. It has been a while since I made this, but I believe about
  seven minutes is enough for me. This chicken is delicious and also
  good cold. Make lots of it.

      2    Onions
      4    Cloves garlic
      2 ts Dark soya sauce
      3 tb Tauco (salted yellow beans)

    1/2 c  Tamarind water
      1 c  Water
 
  This recipe calls for 'tauco' which can be either salted black beans
  or salted yellow beans.  Either can be found in a Chinese market as
  salted black bean or salted yellow bean sauce. Or you can track down
  Indonesian salted yellow beans and smash 'em up yourself. Thai
  markets carry them.
  
  Cut the chicken into serving pieces; wash, and dry. Slice the onions.
  Pound the garlic and the tauco into a smooth paste.
  
  Fry the onions in the oil for half a minute.  Add the tauco, then the
  chicken.  Stir well, so that every part of the chicken is coated with
  tauco.  Put in the soya sauce and the rest of the ingredients. Cover,
  and simmer very gently for 45 minutes.  Then take the lid off, and
  cook for a further 5 minutes to reduce the sauce. Serve hot.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

MMMMM-----------------YELLOW CORNMEAL DUMPLINGS----------------------
      1 c  Ground yellow cornmeal
    3/4 c  All purpose flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts White pepper
  2 1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Unsalted butter, softened
      2 c  Chicken stock

MMMMM------------------------AZAFRAN SOUP-----------------------------
      6 c  Water
      2 tb Azafran (see note)
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts White pepper
      3 c  Chicken stock
      2    Yellow summer squash, diced
      3 c  Corn kernels
      1    Bunch spinach, washed and
           -stemmed
 
  To make the dumplings, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder,
  salt, pepper, and sugar together in a bowl.  Add the butter and milk
  and mix well to make a batter that is moist but not sticky.  If the
  dough is too moist, knead in a little more flour.  Divide the dough
  into 1" balls, flatten, and shape into small triangles.
  
  Pour the chicken stock into a pot and bring to a boil over medium
  heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and drop in the dumplings.  Cook 3
  to 4 minutes, until tender and cooked all the way through.  Remove
  the dumplings from the stock and set aside.
  
  For the soup, heat 2 cups of the water and the azafran in a large
  saucepan over medium-high heat until the liquid has reduced by half,
  about 7 minutes.  Pour through a fine sieve, discard the azafran, and
  return the liquid to the saucepan.  Add salt, pepper, stock, and the
  remaining 4 cups of the water and bring to a boil over medium-high
  heat. Add squash, reduce the heat ans simmer 5 minutes.  Add cork
  kernels and simmer another 5 minutes.  Add dumplings and spinach,
  cook 2 minutes, and serve immediately.
  
  **Note**  Azafran, also called Native American saffron my the American
  Indians, is an herb that is actually fine threads from the stigma of
  the safflower plant.  Despite the name, azafran is not the same as
  saffron, which is an expensive spice derived from the crocus plant in
  the iris family.  (Saffron can be substituted for azafran, though:
  use 1 pinch of saffran for 2 tablespoons of azafran).
  
  Azafran is commonly sold in Latin American markets and specialty herb
  stores.  It can also be ordered by mail.  It is best stored in a cool
  dark place and will last several months in a sealed plastic or glass
  container.

      1    Recipe below
 
  Wolfert writes: "If you run out of preserved lemons, or decide on
  just a few day's notice to cook a chicken, lamb, or fish dish with
  lemons and olives and need preserved lemons in a hurry, you can use
  this quick five-day method taught to me by a Moroccan diplomat's
  wife. Lemons preserved this way will not keep, but are perfectly
  acceptable in an emergency."
  
  With a razor blade, make 8 fine 2" vertical incisions around the peel
  of each lemon to be used. (Do not cut deeper than the membrane that
  protects the pulp.) Place the incised lemons in a stainless-steel
  saucepan with plenty of salt and water to cover and boil until the
  peels become very soft.  Place in a clean jar, covered with cooled
  cooking liquor, and leave to pickle for approximately 5 days.

      Title: B'STILA (MOROCCAN CHICKEN/NUT PIE)
 Categories: Appetizers, Moroccan
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Almond, blanched
           Oil
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
           Honey; to taste (opt)
      1 tb Ghi
    1/3 c  Butter
      1 md Onion; minced
    1/2    Chicken; boned & cubed small
    1/2 ts Pepper
      1 pn Saffron
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    3/4 c  Parsley; minced
    1/4 c  Coriander; minced
           Salt; to taste
      2    Egg
      1 pk Filo sheets
    1/4 lb Butter; melted
 
  Brown almonds in a little oil until golden.  Chop coarsely or pound
  with a mortar and pestle.  Add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and (optionally)
  honey or sugar to sweeten to taste (ANC adds none but cites recipes
  calling for up to 1/2 cup sugar--I favor a little honey as the
  contrast of the sweetness with the savory chicken is part of the
  exotic appeal of the dish). Set aside.
  
  Heat ghi and butter in a large heavy pot.  Add minced onion and saut
  for a few minutes.  Add chicken meat equivalent to about 1/2 chicken
  (e.g. two boneless breasts), cut in small pieces (as for a pot pie),
  along with pepper, saffron, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, parsley,
  coriander, and salt to taste.
  
  Simmer until the chicken is done.  Beat two eggs and slowly stir them
  into the sauce.  remove from heat.
  
  Have ready filo sheets, melted butter (at least 1/4 lb), and a pastry
  brush.  Select a shallow baking pan about 8" in diameter, such as an
  iron skillet.  What you basically want to do is construct a pie by
  layering the filo sheets in the pan and then folding them over the
  contents; it will probably be easiest if you cut the sheets in half
  or smaller, for instance into long rectangles about the width of the
  pan and twice as long. Brush one of the sheets with melted butter,
  and put it, butter side up, in the bottom of the pan, the excess
  dangling over the side. Add another sheet, at an angle to the first,
  and repeat so that you have filo covering the bottom of the pan and
  dangling out all around (this is hard to describe). Use about 5
  sheets to form this layer. Repeat the process, forming another layer.
  Now pour the chicken and sauce into the pan. Put several more
  buttered sheets on top of the chicken, this time not overlapping the
  edge--use smaller pieces or fold them in half. Spread the nut mixture
  on top of this.  Put another layer or so of filo, then fold the
  dangling ends over the top so as to close the envelope. (Your mileage
  may vary on the number and details of layering the sheets). Brush the
  top with butter. At this point the b'stila can be refrigerated if
  desired (this is time-consuming and you may wish to do all this the
  day before serving).
  
  Just before serving, put the pan in a 350-degree oven for 15-20
  minutes until the top is golden: flip it onto an oven-proof plate (or
  use an ordinary plate to flip it over back into the skillet) and
  return to brown the other side, 30-40 minutes total.  place on a
  serving platter, sprinkle with powdered sugar, then make fanciful
  decorative designs with ground cinnamon.  (When I had this in a
  restaurant it said something like "eat me.")
