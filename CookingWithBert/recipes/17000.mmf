    1/4 c  Seedless raspberry preserves
           Frosting (opt, recipe below)
 
  1. Separate eggs one hour before preparing cake, if possible. Allow
  whites to sit, covered, at room temperature for 1 hour. Put 4 yolks
  in a cup; cover tightly and refrigerate until ready to continue
  recipe. Refrigerate remaining yolks, covered, for use at another time.
  
  2. When whites have come to room temperature, heat oven to 325'F. In a
  medium bowl, gradually beat water into whites until smooth. Add 4
  yolks and salad oil; beat until well combined.
  
  3. Add cake flour, cocoa, 1 C sugar, baking soda, and salt. Beat just
  until smooth; stir in vanilla.
  
  4. Add cream of tartar to egg whites. Beat until fluffy. Continue

  completely combined. Turn into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake
  until cake springs back when gently touched-about 55 to 60 minutes.

  pletely, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, before removing from pan. In a large bowl,
  combine cream, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and cocoa for filling.
  Refrigerate.
  
  7. To assemble, carefully loosen cake from pan; remove pan and invert
  cake on serving plate. Cut a 1 inch slice, crosswise, from top of
  cake. Remove and set aside.
  
  8. Hollow out center of cake leaving 1-inch thick walls on all sides.
  Beat cream mixture just until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to
  overbeat.

  chunks. You need about 5 cups. Fold into cream. Spoon into hollow of
  cake. Remaining cake scraps are good for snacking.
  
  10. Invert reserved ring of cake so that the top is down; spread
  exposed side with raspberry preserves. Place on cake with preserves
  down. Cover tightly and refrigerate several hours or overnight. If
  desired, frost before serving.

  A good basic chocolate fudge. The use of whipping cream or non-dairy
  cream substitute makes stirring unnecessary. This makes a very creamy
  fudge. Combine cocoa, sugar, salt, and heavy cream in a large
  saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil; then reduce heat to medium and
  cook to 234 degrees F. without stirring. Remove from heat and add
  butter and vanilla. Do not stir. Cool to lukewarm (about 110 degrees
  F.). Beat by hand or with mixer until fudge thickens and loses some
  of its gloss. Quickly spread fudge in lightly buttered 8-inch square
  pan. When cool, cut into squares. Makes about 49 pieces.

 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 Article
 
 
  HERSHEY'S Cocoa may be substituted for a variety of chocolate baking
  ingredients in recipes. HERSHEY'S Unsweetened Cocoa is naturally low
  in fat, very low in sodium and is cholesterol-free. Use the following
  guide to substitute HERSHEY'S Cocoa for other chocolate:
  
  Unsweetened Baking Chocolate = 3 level tablespoons HERSHEY'S Cocoa
  plus 1 tablespoon shortening (liquid or solid) equals 1 square (1
  ounce) chocolate.
  
  Semi-Sweet Chocolate = 6 level tablespoons HERSHEY'S Cocoa plus 7
  tablespoons sugar plus 1/4 cup shortening equals 1 cup semi-sweet
  chocolate chips or six squares (1 ounce each) semi-sweet baking
  chocolate.
  
  Premelted Unsweetened Chocolate = 3 tablespoons HERSHEY'S Cocoa plus 1
  tablespoon oil or melted shortening equals 1 envelope (1 ounce).

 Categories: Candies, Chocolate, Microwave
      Yield: 26 Servings
 
      4 c  (8 1/2-oz) shredded coconut
           -(fresh package!)
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
      1 pk (11 1/2-oz) milk chocolate
           -pieces
    1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
     26    Whole natural almonds (1-oz)
 
  Tastes just like Almond Joy.
  
  Line two large cookie sheets with waxed paper. Set large wire cooling
  rack on paper; set aside.
  
  Place coconut in large bowl; set aside.
  
  Place corn syrup in a 1-cup glass measure. Microwave on high (100%) 1
  minute or until syrup boils. Immediately pour over coconut. Work warm
  syrup into coconut using the back of a wooden spoon until coconut is
  thoroughly coated. This takes a little time, and yes, there is enough
  syrup.
  
  Using 1 level measuring tablespoon of coconut, shape into a ball by
  squeezing coconut firmly in palm of one hand, then rolling between
  both palms. (HINT: Measure out all of the coconut then roll into
  balls.) Place 2 inches apart on wire racks. Let dry 10 minutes.
  Reroll coconut balls so there are no loose ends of coconut sticking
  up.
  
  Place milk chocolate and shortening in a 4-cup glass measure or 1 1/2
  quart microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes or until

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Cake:
    3/4 c  Cake flour
      8 lg Egg whites
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
      1 c  Superfine sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 ts Almond extract
    1/2 c  Coconut, shredded (unsweeten
           -d)
           Frosting:
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      2 lg Egg whites
      1 ts Orange zest, grated
    1/4 c  Orange juice, strained
      1 tb Corn syrup
      1 c  Coconut, shredded and toaste
           -   (unsweetened)
 
  Onto a sheet of wax paper, sift the flour 3 times.  In a large bowl
  with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the salt until they
  are frothy. Add the cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Beat in
  1/2 cup sugar, a little at a time.  Add the vanilla and almond
  extract, and beat the whites to stiff peaks. Fold in the remaining
  1/2 cup sugar, a little at a time. Sift the flour over the whites in
  4 batches, folding it in gently after each sifting.  Fold in the
  coconut.
  
  Spoon batter into a 9-inch tube pan, 3 1/2-inches deep. Bake in the
  middle of a preheated 275f oven for
    1 1/2    hours.
  
  Hang the cake in the pan, upside down, on the neck of a bottle and
  let it cool for 90-120 minutes or until cooled completely. Release
  the cake with a sharp knife, turn it out on a rack and invert it onto
  a cake plate.
  
  In a metal bowl, whisk together the sugar, egg whites, zest, juice,
  corn syrup, and a pinch of salt.  Set the bowl over simmering water,
  and cook, whisking, until it registers 140f on a candy thermometer.
  Remove pan from heat and whisk the mixture over the hot water for 3
  minutes. Remove the bowl from the water and, with an electric mixer,
  beat the frosting at high speed for 7-10 minutes or until it is cool
  and holds stiff peaks.
  
  Spread top and sides of the cake with the frosting and coat the
  outside with the toasted coconut.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Shrimp in coconut beer batter with dipping sauce -- Adapted from
  Chef Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen." A nice appetizer, though
  very caloric.
  
  *  Don't put too much batter on or it will overwhelm the poor shrimp.
  The dipping sauce is great for other things as well.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you can deep-fry.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Measure batter, improvise with spices and dipping sauce.

      Title: COCONUT CHICKEN SOUP
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 cn Coconut milk
      4 c  Chicken stock
      1 md Chicken
      1 c  Whipping cream
      4 sl Galangal
      1    Lime or lemon
        pn Of chili powder
           Salt
 
  A very simple one...
  
  Heat stock and add galangal, chili, whipping cream and coconut milk.
  Cut chicken up into bite size pieces. As soon as the mixture begins
  to boil, add the chicken pieces and squeeze in the lemon or lime
  juice and salt to taste.  The trick is to add the chicken right when
  the mixture starts to boil.  Don't let the milk really boil. Cook the
  chicken for a very short time, about half a minute.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  I must admit that when I typed this recipe, I missed the
  amount of coconut milk to use.  The one can is a guess++that's how
  much I would use, at least on the first try.

  use your hands. Coat a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with vegetable spray.
  Transfer the candy mixture to the pan and pat it firmly in place.
  Cover and store in the coldest part of your refrigerator overnight.
  In a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water, melt thr

  squares. Using a toothpick, dip the candy into the chocolate to coat.
  Place on waxed paper to harden. Will probably need to be hardened in

  1. In large bowl, stir together butter, corn syrup, vanilla and salt.
  Gradually add powdered sugar and coconut, beating until blended.
  
  2. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon additional powdered sugar on flat
  surface. Spoon coconut mixture onto prepared surface; knead about 5

  shape. Place on wax paper-covered tray.
  
  3. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours before dipping into SIMPLE CHOCOLATE
  COATING. Place coated eggs on wax paper-covered tray. Store in cool,
  dry place. About 40 candies.
  
  SIMPLE CHOCOLATE COATING
  
  1. In medium heat-proof bowl, place chocolate chips and shortening. In
  separate large heat-proof bowl, put very warm water (100 F. to 110
  F.) to 1-inch depth. Carefully place bowl with chocolate into bowl
  with water; water should come halfway up side of chocolate bowl.
  
  2. With dry rubber scraper, stir chocolate and shortening CONSTANTLY,
  until chocolate and shortening are melted and mixture is smooth. Do
  NOT get water in bowl with chocolate.* If water cools, replace it
  with very warm water as directed above. Remove chocolate bowl from
  inside water bowl.
  
  3. With fork, one at a time, dip chilled centers into chocolate
  mixture; gently tap fork on edge of bowl to remove excess
  chocolate.** Invert coated center on prepared tray; swirl small
  amount of melted chocolate on top to cover fork marks; let stand
  until firm. Store candies loosely covered in cool, dry place. Coating
  for 3 to 4 dozen centers.
  
  * If water or moisture gets into chocolate, it can seize and tighten.
  As an emergency measure, ONLY, stir in additional shortening, 1/2
  teaspoonful at a time, just until chocolate is fluid again.
  
  ** If chocolate mixture cools below 84 F, return bowl with chocolate
  into bowl with warm water. Chocolate is best for coating between 84
  F. and 88 F.

      3/4 c  sugar
        6 TB cornstarch
        2 lg egg yolks
        1 ts vanilla extract
        2 c  shredded coconut
  :          Meringue topping
        5 lg egg whites, -- at room
  :          temperature
      1/2 c  sugar
      1/2 ts cream of tartar
        1    prebaked pie crust
  
  Combine the cream and 1/2 cup of the milk in a saucepan with the
  sugar. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the
  sugar, until small bubbles form around the edge.
  
  Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl whisk the remaining 3/4 cup of cold milk
  into the cornstarch. Whisk in the egg yolks. Slowly stir in 1/2 cup
  of the hot cream mixture, then slowly stir this mixture into the
  remaining hot cream. Cook, continuing to stir, about 1/2 a minute
  more until the mixture forms soft shapes when dropped from a spoon.
  Remove the custard from the heat, and stir in the vanilla. Transfer
  to a medium-size bowl, and stir occasionally to allow steam to
  escape. Stir in all but 1/4 cup of the coconut. Cover the surface
  with wax paper or plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming and
  cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
  F. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Slowly
  beat in the sugar and cream of tartar and continue to beat until the
  meringue is shiny and holds stiff peaks.
  
  Spoon the cooled custard into the prebaked pie shell and spread the
  meringue over the pie, covering the entire surface. Sprinkle with the
  remaining coconut. Bake on the center rack of the oven until the
  peaks are golden, about 10 minutes. Let cool and refrigerate for 1
  hour before serving.

      Title: COCONUT FLAN WITH CARAMEL (BANH DUA CA RA MEN
 Categories: Vietnamese, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Dessert
 
MMMMM--------------------------CARAMEL-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Hot water

MMMMM--------------------------CUSTARD-------------------------------
      1 c  Fresh or canned coconut milk
      1 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  This is the ultimate coconut dessert++an adaptation of the classic
  "Creme renversee", or "Flan au caramel". The technique used is
  distinctly French but the flavors are all Vietnamese.
  
  This custard is at its best when prepared a day in advance and
  refrigerated so the flavors can mellow. If you just can't wait, you
  might try the Vietnamese method of rapid cooling for dishes such as
  this: place a small scoop of shaved ice on top of each custard before
  serving!
  
  Preheat the oven to 325F.
  
  Make the caramel:  Cook the sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low
  heat, swirling the pan constantly, until brown. Stir the hot water
  into the caramel, being careful to guard against splattering (the
  mixture will bubble vigorously).  Boil the mixture, swirling the pan
  occasionally, until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, about 2
  minutes.
  
  Pour the caramel syrup into a 1-quart souffle dish or five 4-ounce
  ramekins.  Tilt the molds to coat all of the surfaces with caramel.
  
  Make the custard:  Combine the coconut milk, milk and sugar in a
  medium saucepan over low heat.  Scald until the sugar dissolves
  completely. Remove from heat.
  
  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla. Gradually whisk the hot
  coconut milk mixture into the eggs, blending thoroughly.
  
  Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl. Carefully pour
  into the caramel-lined souffle dish or ramekins.
  
  Line a large roasting pan with 2 layers of paper towels (see Note).
  Put the souffle dish in the roasting pan and add hot water to reach
  halfway up the side of the dish.  Bake in the center of the oven for
  50 minutes (30 minutes if using ramekins), or until a knife inserted
  in the center comes out clean.  Be careful not to let the water boil;
  do not disturb the custard while baking.  This is the only "secret"
  to producing a smooth and velvety custard.
  
  Remove the souffle dish immediately from the hot water. Allow to cool
  in a cold-water bath.  Chill thoroughly.
  
  To serve, run a knife around the edge of the custard and turn out onto
  dessert plates.  Serve with shaved ice or whipped cream, if desired.
  
  Note:  The paper towels in the roasting pan serve a twofold purpose:
  First, they allow the hot water to circulate under the souffle dish
  while baking to distribute the heat evenly; second, if using small
  ramekins, it stabilizes them and keeps them from moving around while
  baking.
  
  Yield: 5 servings.

 Categories: Desserts, Ices, Vegetarian
      Yield: 700 Grams
 
    450 g  Granulated sugar
    150 ml Water
      1 ts Vanilla essence
    100 g  Desiccated coconut
           Red vegetable colouring
 
  First line an 18 cm (7 inch) square tin with nonstick paper.
  
  Put the granulated sugar and water into a medium-sized, heavy-based
  saucepan and heat gently, without boiling, until the sugar has
  dissolved.
  
  Bring to the boil and let it simmer steadily until the temperature
  reaches 120 C (240 F) on a sugar thermometer, or a little of the
  syrup dropped into a cup of cold water forms a soft ball. Remove from
  the heat immediately and add the vanilla essence and dessicated
  coconut.
  
  Stir the mixture for 5-10 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and
  set, then pour half of it into the prepared tin and smooth it level.
  Colour the remaining half pale pink with a drop or two of the
  colouring, then pour this on top of the white coconut ice, spreading
  it to the edges and making sure it's level. Press it all down quite
  firmly with the back of a spoon, and leave it to harden.
  
  Turn the coconut ice out and cut it into squares using a sharp knife.

      Title: COCONUT ICE CREAM
 Categories: Desserts, Ice cream
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      5 c  Grated fresh coconut *
      1 c  Sugar
      3 c  Milk
      5    Egg yolks
 
  1.  Put the grated coconut in a saucepan and add the sugar and milk.
      Bring to the boil and cook about 5 minutes.  Let cool. 2. Strain
  the liquid through a piece of cheesecloth and squeeze the
      coconut meat to extract as much liquid as possible. Reserve 2
      cups of the grated meat and discard the rest or put it to another
      use. 3. Put the egg yolks in a mixing bowl and beat with a whisk.
  Beat
      in the sweetened liquid and scrape the mixture into a saucepan
      and heat.  Use a wooden spoon and stir constantly, this way and
      that, making certain that the spoon touches all over the bottom
      of the saucepan.  Cook until the mixture has a custard-like
      consistency and coats the sides of the spoon (180 degrees). Do
      not let the sauce boil, or it will curdle.  This cooking will rid
      the custard of the raw taste of the yolks. 4. Immediately remove
  the sauce from the heat and continue stirring.
      Set the saucepan in a basin of cold water to reduce the
      temperature.  Let the sauce cool to room temperature. 5. Pour the
  custard into the container of an electric or hand-
      cranked ice cream maker.  Partly freeze according to the
      manufacturer's instructions.  Add the reserved 2 cups of coconut
      pulp and continue freezing until solid.
  
  * GRATED FRESH COCONUT
  
  Use 1 or 2 coconuts.  It is best to use 2 in case 1 isn't sweet
  enough. Select large coconuts that are heavy and contain a lot of
  liquid. You can determine the amount of liquid when you shake the
  coconut.
  
  Pierce the "eyes" of the coconut with an ice pick. Crack the shell of
  the coconut in several places, using a hammer or hatchet.
  
  Pry out the flesh with a blunt knife.  Pare away the dark skin. Grate
  the coconut using the coarse blade of a grater or a food processor.

      Title: COCONUT JOYS
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    1/4 lb Butter (or margarine)
      3 c  Coconut
           -(one standard package)
      2 c  Powdered sugar
      2 oz Chocolate (unsweetened),
           -melted (2 squares)
 
  Melt butter in a sauce pan.  Remove from heat.  Add powdered sugar and
  coconut.  Mix well.
  
  Shape rounded teaspoons of mixture into balls.  Make an indent in
  center of each and place on cookie sheet. Fill centers with melted
  chocolate. Chill until firm. Store in refrigerator.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Super-sweet, super-rich holiday cookies -- This is an easy recipe
  that can knock your socks off for flavor and sweetness. In other
  words, it will make your teeth fall out.
  
  *  We use sweetened coconut and also use semi-sweet chocolate. This
  is why they make your teeth fall out.
  
  *  I tried an approach of melting the stick of margarine using the
  microwave on full for 48 seconds. While it was melting, I measured and
  mixed up the dry ingredients. I then poured half the liquid over the
  premixed coconut-sugar mixture; mixed some and poured in the
  remainder. This worked well for me, but my wife insists that the
  listed method is easier.
  
  *  Your clean thumb is the best way to make the indentations.
  
  *  Be sure to keep them in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  375degrees F.) 25 to 30 minutes. Spread Tinted Seven Minute Frosting
  between layers and on top and sides of cake. Sprinkle top and sides
  of cake with Baker's Southern Style Coconut. Use the recipe for
  Coconut Layer Cake. Spread Fudge Frosting between layers and on top
  and sides of cake. Decorate sides of cake with chopped pecans, if
  desired.  Note: This recipe was taken from an old phamplet dated
  1940, which featured Kate Smith's favorite Cakes. It was published by
  General Mills, and the pampHlet is falling apart! I am glad to be
  able to save these old recipes. For those who too young to remember,
  where
    it calls for the use of a rotary mixer in these recipes, just use
  your electric mixer, or hand mixer as required.

      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Coconut, shredded
           Almonds, whole,
           -unblanched (optional)
 
  Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  In large bowl use an electric mixer
  to beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gradually beat in
  sugar. Add vanilla. With a rubber spatula gently fold in coconut.
  
  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto greased, floured cookie sheets.
  Press an almond in center of each cookie. Bake at 300 degrees F. for
  20 to 25 minutes. Remove to racks to cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Holiday cookies -- Coconut and almonds give this cookie a
  distinctive flavor.  For me the almonds are required.
  
  *  It is a lot of work to beat the egg whites enough without an
  electric mixer.
  
  *  This cookie must be handled a little more carefully than most as it
  forms a white shell which causes it to be slightly delicate.

      Title: COCONUT MILK
 Categories: Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Coconut, grated
      2 c  To 2 1/2 cups boiling water
 
  Coconut Milk is Santen in Malaysia and Indonesia. Coconut Milk is
  Narial Ka Doodth in India. Best made from Fresh Coconuts. Grate the
  flesh of one Coconut into a bowl, pour on 2-2 1/2 c Boiling Water,
  then leave to stand 30 min. Squeeze
  
  The flesh and strain before using. This makes thick Coconut Milk, for
  a thinner milk reuse the pulp and mix the result with the thick milk,
  or use by itself for an even thinner Coconut Milk. I use an old
  T-shirt to squeeze the Coconut flesh and strain in one operation.
  
  Made from Dried Coconut Put 1 Cup unsweetened Dried Coconut into a
  blender. Pour in about 1 1/4 Cups boiling water and blend on high
  speed for a couple of minutes. Let cool for about fifteen minutes
  then squeeze the pulp and strain. Makes about 1 Cup milk. To make a
  thinner milk reuse the pulp.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Quart
 
      1 c  Sugar
      2 lg Eggs
      4 c  Canned coconut milk
 
  1.  In a bowl beat together the sugar and eggs until pale in color,
  about 5 minutes.  Beat in the coconut milk.
  
  2.  Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's
  instructions.  Serve right away or store in the freezer.
  
  TIPS:  You may need to allow extra time for hardening in the freezer
  if your ice cream maker turns out a soft ice cream. You can
  substitute any good-quality ice cream if you don't have the time and
  equipment to make the ice creams called for.

    1/4    Fresh coconut
      1 sl Terasi
      1    Clove garlic
      3    Cabe rawit *
           Salt
      1 sm Piece of gula Jawa or:
      2 ts Brown sugar
      1 tb Tamarind water or:
      1    Kaffir lime, juice only or:
      1    Lime, juice only
 
  * This is the minimum amount of cabe rawit; if you like your sambal
  really hot, put in 6 or 8 cabe rawit instead of 3. But remember that
  cabe rawit is the hottest and fiercest of all the chilli family.
  
  This sambal is made from fresh coconut, and should be eaten on the
  same day.
  
  Separate the white flesh of the coconut from all trace of the brown
  outer skin, then grate it. Grill or fry the terasi, and then pound
  it, together with the garlic, cabs rawit and gula jawa into a paste.
  Add the tamarind water, or juice, season with salt, and mix the paste
  thoroughly with the grated coconut. Serve.

  Here, courtesy of Mark Herron in Sydney, is a series of recipes from
  Downunder.  These coconut recipes are from the Sydney Morning Herald
  9/29/92 from a cooking column titled "Raw Materials" by Meryl
  Constance. These are in an odd format, aside from being metric. There
  are no ingredient lists or amounts leading the body of the recipe. I
  considered listing the ingredients first, but++since I use a
  non-standard format++ maybe someone with MM or one of the other
  recipe programs would rather put them into that format. And no way am
  I going to try to translate the metric measurements into American
  ones.  Some of you whiz-kids with recipe programs with that feature
  conversions can tackle that. As you'll see, these come from all over
  the world, not just from Australia. Mark++gotta couple of question on
  ingredients.  The rabbit recipe below calls for both red and green
  capsicums and birdseye chillies. I know what the latter are, but are
  "capsicums" what we call green or red bell peppers up here? And I
  *think* that what are referred to as "brown onions" are probably the
  one's with brownish skins that we call "yello onions" here.
  
  And thanks for sending the papers over!  I getting a kick out of not
  only the recipes, but also the ads and articles. A nice peek into
  Ozzie life.
  
  This is a version of an old recipe from Barbados.  You can use light
  or dark rum.  One of the ingredients is simple syrup which is made by
  dissolving 4 parts (any measure) sugar in 3 parts of water. If you
  can't find a fresh young coconut, the chilled drinks cabinet in many
  Asian food stores contains young coconut juice, which has been frozen
  in plastic packs.
  
  Put into a cocktail shaker or mixing bowl 30 ml lime juice, 60 ml
  simple syrup, 90 ml rum.  120 ml young coconut- nut juice. Shake or
  stir with ice cubes and strain into a tall glass. Garnish with a lime
  leaf.
  
  Serves 1 (lavishly).

      Title: COCONUT TOFU SOUP (VEGAN~ BUT HIGH FAT)
 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Extra-firm tofu
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 cn Coconut milk (I try to get
           Frozen, or make fresh if I
           Am ambitious)
  1 1/2 c  Vegetable stock (or water)
      1 tb Light soy sauce
           Keffir Lime leaves - to
           Taste, this is a tough one
           Since it can come packaged
           In a number of ways. I
           Typically get dried in which
           Case I let 2 to 3 T soak in
           Water before using*.
      1 oz Galanga (Kah) - Galanga is
           Thai ginger
      1    To 3 Thai or Serrano Chiles
           To taste (I like 4!)
 
  *Very marginal substitutes (although still good!) are to try 1/4 c.
  coarsly chopped lemon grass, or the juice from 1 lime. This has to be
  experimented with, it is used to reduce the sweetness of the coconut
  milk. You do not want this flavor to dominate, though. Add a little
  at a time, and taste to get it right.
  
  Drain the tofu of extra water by placing a heavy weight over the tofu
  surrounded by 3 layers of paper towels. Cut tofu into bite size
  pieces. Stir fry the garlic in the oil until golden (do not burn),
  then stir fry the tofu until it is an even golden brown. In a medium
  size sauce pan mix the coconut milk, stock (or water) and soy sauce.
  Add the tofu, Keffir Lime leaves (or substitute), and Galanga. Cook
  over low to medium heat for 15 minutes, do not allow to boil! At this
  point, taste the soup. If the coconut taste is too strong add a
  little more of the Keffir Lime leaves (or substitute). The idea is to
  reduce the sweetness of the coconut milk. With the flat of a heavy
  knife (or something similar) pound the chilies until they are split
  in several places. Add to the soup, and let cook a couple minutes
  more.
  
  Serve over steamed rice (preferably, Jasmine Rice).

      Title: COCONUT-ALMOND MACAROONS
 Categories: Desserts, Cookies, Cathe
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
MMMMM------------------------ALMOND PASTE-----------------------------
     20 oz Almonds, blanched
           -(can use whole or pieces)
  3 1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
      3 lg Egg whites, lightly beaten

MMMMM--------------------------COOKIES-------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
      1 pk Coconut, sweetened
           -(large)
      1 x  Almond paste, broken
           -into chunks
      1 tb Vanilla extract
           Salt
      6 lg Egg whites
 
  PREPARE ALMOND PASTE:  Process almonds in food processer until finely
  chopped, almost almond butter. Add confectioners' sugar and process
  till smooth.  Add egg whites.
  
  Mixture should become very stiff and form a ball in the machine. If
  you cannot get it to become evenly moistened, take the mixture out
  and knead it on a board "floured" with confectioners' sugar. Divide
  the well-blended paste into three equal batches.  (Can wrap well at
  this point to refrigerate, up to a week.)
  
  MAKE MACAROONS:  Make this recipe in a food processor in three
  batches. For each batch use 1/2 Cup each granulated and
  confectioner's sugar, 1/3 of the coconut and almond paste, 1/8 t
  salt, 1 t vanilla and
        2    egg whites.
  
  In processor bowl, combine granulated sugar and coconut. Process
  about 2 minutes or until the coconut is finely ground. Add the
  confectioners' sugar and the almond paste. Process until the mixture
  resembles cornmeal. With the machine running, add the salt, vanilla
  and egg whites. Process until the mixture is evenly moistened.
  
  Drop mixture by teaspoonsful onto a cookie sheet covered with brown
  paper. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 15-20 minutes, or until the
  macaroons are lightly browned. Remove from oven and place brown paper
  on a damp towel. When cookies are slightly cooled, use a spatula to
  remove them; place them in an air-tight container so they will remain
  chewy. Makes 3 to 4 dozen small cookies or 18 large ones.

  1.  Cook the lamb in 2 cups of water over moderate heat for 5 minutes,
  stirring several times.  Drain well to remove excess fat.
  
  2.  Add the 2 remaining cups of water to the pan, cover, and cook
  over low heat for 1 hour.  This should tenderize the lamb.
  
  3.  Trim the fava bean pods on both ends.  Cut the pods into 3 equal
  pieces. Add them to the lamb with the salt, sugar, and scallions.
  Cover the pan and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes, or until the
  favas are tender. Adjust the salt.
  
  The preparation of this Passover dish exemplifies the Turkish
  preference for the natural taste of ingredients. Only the simplest of
  seasoning are used here to allow the flavor of the favas to dominate.

      Title: COEURS A LA CREME
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz Unsalted cream cheese
     10 oz Soured cream
      2 tb Caster sugar
      2 lg Egg whites

MMMMM--------------------------TO SERVE-------------------------------
           Fruit of your choice, such
           -as raspberries and
           -redcurrants
      4 tb Double cream
 
  Quite simply combine the cream cheese, soured cream and sugar
  thoroughly in a mixing bowl. Then whisk the egg whites until they are
  stiff and fold them carefully into the cream mixture. The whole lot
  now needs to be drained - overnight - in a cool place, and this is
  done by placing the mixture in a suitably-sized square of muslin, and
  placing this in a sieve over a bowl. When it has drained completely,
  pile the mixture into small dishes or ramekins, arrange your fruit on
  top, then pour a tablespoon of cream over each serving.

      Title: COEURS A LA CREME WITH FRESH RASPBERRY COULIS
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Curd or cottage cheese
           -OR- Cream cheese
     10 fl Double (heavy) cream
      2 tb Caster (superfine) sugar
      2    Egg whites
      5 fl Single (light) cream
      8 oz Raspberries

MMMMM----------------------RASPBERRY COULIS---------------------------
     10 oz Fresh raspberries
    1/2 c  Caster (superfine) sugar
      2 tb Lemon juice
 
  Traditionally the heart-shaped moulds were made of wicker; now china
  ones are used.  If you decide to use cream cheese, make sure it is
  unsalted.
  
  Press the cheese through a fine sieve into a mixing bowl and stir in
  first the double cream then the sugar. Beat until light and fluffy.
  In a small bowl, beat the egg whites just until stiff. Fold them
  carefully into the cheese mixture.
  
  Line six moulds with fine damp muslin or cheesecloth. Spoon the
  cheese into the prepared moulds, tapping the sides gently to allow
  the mixture to settle.  Fold the ends of the cloth over the moulds,
  place them on a cake rack and refrigerate overnight.
  
  To make coulis, liquidize the raspberries and sugar to a smooth
  puree. Add lemon juice to taste.  Pass through a sieve into a small
  bowl. To serve, spoon a little of the raspberry coulis on to each
  serving plate. Discard any draining liquid and unmould the
  heart-shaped desserts on top of the sauce.  Drizzle with cream and
  surround with the raspberries.

      Title: COFFEE CAKE MUFFINS
 Categories: Muffins
      Yield: 12 Muffins
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS
    1/2 c  Pecans; finely chopped
    1/3 c  Light brown sugar; firmly
           -packed
  1 1/2 c  Plus 1 tabl. flour
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
      1 tb Butter or margarine; melted
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
    1/2 c  Milk
      1    Egg
     12    Pecan halves; optional
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degree F. Grease 12 muffin pan cups; set aside.
  In a small bowl; mix together pecans, brown sugar, 1 T flour,
  cinnamon, nutmeg, and butter; set aside.
  
  In a medium bowl, sift together 1 1/2 cups flour, granulated sugar,
  baking powder and salt; cut in shortening. In a small bowl, blend egg
  with milk. Add to dry ingredients with half of the pecan mixture,
  stirring until just blended.  Spoon batter into muffin cups; sprinkle
  with remaining pecan mixture.  Garnish each muffin with a pecan half.
  Bake 15 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center comes out
  clean. Remove muffins from pan to cool on wire rack.
  
  Mixing muffin ingredients requires a special, but easy-to-learn
  technique. The liquid ingredients (milk, eggs, etc.) are beaten
  together and then added all at once to the dry ingredients. Mixing is
  kept to a minimum--just enough to moisten the dry ingredients. The
  batter should be lumpy, not smooth. These muffins freeze very well.

           Glaze:
      3 tb Strong brewed coffee
  1 1/2 ts Instant espresso powder
    3/4 c  Confectioner's sugar
 
  Into a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, soda, and salt.
  In another bowl with an electric mixer, cream the butter, and add the
  sugar gradually, beating, and beat the mixture until it is light and
  fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in

      Title: COFFEE CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 45 Servings
 
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Oat flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
      4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    1/3 c  Strong brewed coffee,
           Cooled
 
  "The pronounced flavor of freshly brewed coffee makes these crackers
  an extraordinary treat. They are versatile enough for a champagne
  brunch or a light dessert after a satisfying meal. 325~F. 12 to 18
  minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  Mix the flours and sugar together in a large bowl or in the food
  processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
  
  Add the coffee and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On
  a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. With a
  sharp knife or cookie cutter, cut into 2-inch shapes.
  
  Place the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
  sheet. Prick each one all the way through in 2 or 3 places with the
  tines of a fork. Bake for 12 to 18 minutes, or until the crackers are
  medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 40-45.
  
  VARIATIONS: If you like your coffee a little sweeter, lightly and
  evenly sprinkle the rolled dough with sugar and roll over it lightly
  with your rolling pin before cutting. For crunchiness, add 1/2 cup
  cracked wheat with the flour.
  
  Add 1 Tablespoon grated lemon zest to the flour. To prepare the zest,
  lightly grate the skin of a medium-sized lemon against the fine grate
  of a cheese grater. Use only the colored part. The underlying white
  portion is bitter.

  over low heat, stirring constantly untilchocolate begins to melt.
  Immediately remove from heat; stir until smooth. Place the melted
  chocolate in a small, heavy self sealing bag. Using scissors, make a
  small cut in the corner of the bag; drizzle on or both sides of the
  covered spoons, making a decorative pattern. (Small dots, zig-zag
  lines, circles, etc.)
  
  The above 2 steps can be reversed if you like! Get 6 ozs. of white
  chocolate to cover the spoons and 4 ozs. of chocolate of your choice
  to use to decorate the spoons.
  
  Refrigerate spoons for 30 minutes to allow chocolate to set. Wrap each
  spoon separately in clear or colored plastic wrap. Use ribbon to tie
  off plastic wrap. Store in a cool dry place for 2 to 3 weeks until
  ready to give as gifts.

      Title: COFFEE MERINGUE KISSES
 Categories: Cookies, Christmas
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3 ts Powdered instant coffee
      4    Egg whites, room temperature
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
 
  These cookies - said to have been a favorite with Marie Antoinette -
  are 100 percent fat-free, and have about 20 calories per cookie. They
  also have no flour, so would be good for someone who isn't able to
  eat wheat. They will, however, tie up your oven for 3-4 hours.
  
  Heat oven to 250'F. Use nonstick cookie sheets, or line regular cookie
  sheets with parchment paper. In a food processor with a metal blade,
  process the sugar and coffee powder until the texture of the sugar
  becomes very fine. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites and
  vanilla extract with an electric mixer at medium speed, until very
  frothy. Add cream of tartar, and continue beating at medium speed
  until soft peaks form. Increase beater speed to high, and gradually
  beat in sugar-coffee mixture. Continue beating until soft peaks form
  and mixture has a glossy sheen.
  
  To pipe cookies from pastry bag: Fill pastry bag (or 1-gallon freezer
  bag), fitted with Number 6 plain round pastry tube, with meringue.
  Hold bag upright over prepared cookie sheets and squeeze out
  meringue, leaving pastry tip buried in meringue, until you have piped
  out a round about 1 1/2" in diameter. Lift up tip and stop squeezing.
  Leave 1" between cookies. Or, drop by tablespoonfuls onto prepared
  cookie sheet, leaving 2" between cookies.
  
  Bake 1 hour without opening oven door. Turn off oven, and let
  meringues dry in oven 2-3 hours more without opening oven door.
  (After the first hour, it's okay to peek just once.) At this point
  you can leave them in the oven overnight.
  
  Remove the meringues from the cookie sheet with a spatula. Store in
  airtight container. Makes about 3 dozen.

  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Finely chopped walnuts
           -or pecans
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
           -finely chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Unsalted butter, room temp
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Cold water (or more)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 oz Bittersweet chocolate
      1 tb Instant coffee
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter, room temp
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      3    Eggs

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      2 tb Instant coffee
      2 c  Whipping cream
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Coffee liqueur, such as
           -Kahlua or Tia Maria
    1/4 c  Sifted icing sugar
 
  1. To make crust, preheat oven to 350F (180C). Lightly butter a
  10-inch (25-cm) springform pan. Cut waxed paper to fit bottom. Brush
  or rub with butter, then place butter-side up in pan. Using a fork,
  stir flour with chopped nuts, sugar, chopped chocolate and salt in a
  large mixing bowl Then, stir in butter and vanilla. Add 2 tb water
  and mix until crumbly. If mixture seems dry, stir in remaining 1 tb
  water. Turn into a lined springform pan. Press into bottom and
  halfway up sides. Bake in centre of pre-heated oven until set and
  edges are just starting to brown, about 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on a
  rack. Do not remove sides.
  
  2. To make filling, cut chocolate into coarse pieces, To make on top
  of stove, place chocolate and instant coffee in a small heavy-bottomed
  saucepan set over very low heat. Melt, stirring frequently, and
  remove from heat when small pieces of chocolate are still visible,
  about 5 minutes. Then, stir until smooth. Or, place chocolate and
  instant coffee in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, without stirring,
  on medium until chocolate is almost but not completely melted, about
  2 minutes. Stir until smooth, then cool at room temperature while
  continuing with recipe.
  
  3. In a mixing bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer or wooden
  spoon until very creamy. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and
  lemon-colored. Beat in cooled chocolate mixture until combined. Then,
  beat in eggs, 1 by 1, beating well after each addition. Pour into
  cooled crust, cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour or up
  to 1 day (any longer and crust becomes soggy).
  
  4. Because whipped cream does not hold well, plan to add topping no
  more than 2 hours before serving, To make topping, stir instant
  coffee with cream, vanilla and liqueur, if desired, in a medium-size
  mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat until soft peaks form when
  beaters are lifted. Gradually beat in icing sugar. Spoon on top of
  pie, then use a spoon to mound over filling and swirl surface of
  cream. Top with chocolate curls or chopped chocolate, if you wish.
  Serve fight away or refrigerate for up to 2 hours. Gently remove
  sides from pan. Serve pie chilled on the same day it is made.

      Title: COGNAC COOKIES
 Categories: 
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
      6 oz Chocolate chips
           -(semi-sweet)
  2 1/2 c  Vanilla wafers,
           -crushed fine (a box
           -less some nibbles)
      1 c  Pecans (finely chopped;
           -start with 8-10 oz
           -whole pecans)
    1/2 c  Sugar (white,
           -granulated)
    1/4 c  Corn syrup
    1/3 c  Cognac (Use the best
           -you can afford,
           -it makes a difference!)
 
  Melt chocolate bits.  If you have never worked with melted chocolate
  before, then use a double boiler with the burner set on low.
  
  Crush vanilla wafers very fine (fineness is important). Chop pecans
  (again fineness is everything). Add sugar, corn syrup and cognac (I
  use 1 nip of cognac and  1/2 nip of rum, works fine and costs less).
  Stir in pecans and wafer crumbs.  Now you learn why you were supposed
  to grind them very finely.
  
  By now the mixture should be a smooth paste.  Remove from heat and
  form into about 1-inch balls. Roll balls in extra granulated sugar.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate no-bake cookie -- A terrific, very rich, no-bake
  cookie. Adapted from a recipe in the "Silver Palate Good Times
  Cookbook." Yield: makes 3-4 dozen.
  
  *  Store these in an air-tight container; if you are a chocoholic,
  have someone hide them from you.  They are best if you allow them to
  age and mellow.
  
  : Difficulty:  Moderate to hard (melted chocolate is tricky, and
  rolling the mixture into balls takes practice).
  : Time:  30-60 minutes or more, depending on how deftly you can roll
  the balls.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: COGNAC SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      2 lg Shallots, Minced
      1    Clove Garlic, Minced
      2 tb Cognac
    1/2 c  Brown Stock (See Stocks)
    1/2 c  Heavy Cream
      4 oz Shitake Mushrooms, Sliced
 
  This sophisticated sauce will quickly become a favorite at your house.
  Spoon it over grilled veal chops or a crisp roast duck, and you will
  present a memorable dish indeed. It is outstanding over noodles for a
  small but rich first course.
  
  Salt And Freshly Ground Black Pepper, To Taste
  
  Melt the butter in a heavy medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add
  the shallots and garlic and saute until transparent, about 3 to 4
  minutes. Then add the cognac and flame. To do this, remove the
  saucepan from the heat and touch a lighted match to the edge of the
  pan; the fumes of the cognac will ignite.  Holding the pan away from
  you, allow the flames to die down naturally.  Add the stock and cream
  and simmer over low heat until thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes. Add
  the mushrooms and continue to simmer 3 to 5 minutes more. Season with
  salt and pepper and serve immediately.
  
  Yield:  About 1 cup of sauce.

  Cook the potatoes and parsnips in water until tender. While these are
  cooking,chop leeks (greens as well as whites) and simmer in the milk
  until soft. Next, cook the kale or cabbage and have warm and well
  chopped. Drain the potatoes, season with mace,garlic, salt and
  pepper, and beat well. Add the cooked leeks and milk (be careful not
  to break down the leeks too much). Finally, blend in the kale or
  cabbage and margarine. The texture should be that of a smooth-buttery
  potato with well distributed pieces of leek and kale. Garnish with
  parsley. Colcannon is also made by cooking layered vegetables,
  starting with potatoes, in a slow-cooker during the day. Drain

      1 lb Curly kale or cabbage,
           -cooked
      1 lb Potatoes, cooked
      1    Onion, chopped
      1 oz Dripping per lb. vegetables
           Salt and pepper
           Milk if necessary
      1    Ring, wrapped in greaseproof
           -paper
 
  Mash the potatoes or pass them through a food mill. Chop the cabbage
  or kale and add it to the potatoes. Mix well. Peel and chop the
  onion. Melt a little of the dripping in a large, heavy frying pan and
  cook the onion in it.  Remove and mix with the potato and cabbage.
  Season to taste, and stir in a little milk if the mixture is too
  stiff. Add the rest of the dripping to the hot pan and, when very
  hot, turn the potato and cabbage mixture into the pan and spread it
  out. Fry until brown, then cut it roughly and continue frying until
  there are lots of crisp brown pieces. Just before serving, slip in
  the wrapped ring ~- the trick, as you can see from the rhyme, is to
  make sure the ring doesn't turn up too soon -- then the children will
  eat it all willingly!

      Title: COLCANNON #3
 Categories: Irish, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Potatoes (cooked, mashed)
      1 c  Cooked kale (finely chopped)
      1 c  Hot milk
      4    Chopped scallions (optional)
           Butter
 
  Strip the heads of kale away from the stems and shred them finely.
  Kale is a tough vegetable which needs to cook for 10-20 minutes
  depending on its age.  Cook as you would for any green vegetable in
  furiously boiling salted water until it is just tender.  (Some people
  add 1/2 tsp baking soda to the water to help keep the kale at its
  brightest green.) Strain it and refresh it with cold water. Drain it
  thoroughly and squeeze out any excess water. Nowadays I put the kale
  into a food processor with the hot milk and blend them into a green
  soup which I then mix through the mashed potatoes. I then reheat it
  in the oven until it is very hot. This produces a dish fit for St.
  Patrick's Day in greenness. It is perfectly acceptable just to mix
  the kale and milk into the potatoes without recourse to the food
  processor, but the resulting dish is just speckled green. Do not use
  the processor if you are making colcannon with cabbage instead of
  kale. Don't forget the coin and the ring to amuse the children.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      7 lg Potatoes (or more)
      1 ea Large bunch kale greens
    1/4 c  Butter
           Milk or cream as needed
      4 ea Strips of bacon, cut up
      1 tb Onion, minced
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
     Peel and boil 7 or 8 med. to lge. potatoes until done. Remove
  stalks from leaves of kale greens and tear or chop into very small
  pcs. Bring to a boil with a bit of bacon and simmer while potatoes
  cook. Mash the potatoes with 1/4 c. of butter and milk or cream as
  needed. Add salt and pepper. Drain the chopped, cooked kale. (You
  should have about twice as many potatoes as kale.  Mix the two
  together with 1 tb. minced onion. Correct seasoning and serve with
  butter.
  
     NOTE:  Colcannon is a mixture of buttered greens and potatoes.
  Traditionally concannon was eaten at Halloween. A heaping portion is
  dished onto each plate. A well is made in the center of the mount to
  hold a generous portion of butter.  The colcannon is eaten from
  around the outside in.  You take a scoop, dip it in the well of
  butter in the center and eat. With a glass of buttermilk, the WAS a
  meal in itself. In the Midlands, colcannon is called "thump".  In the
  north and western parts of Ireland it is called "champ". To tell
  fortunes on Halloween, a ring and a silver coin were mixed into the
  colcannon...whoever got the ring was soon to marry and whoever got
  the coin would be wealthy.

  garlic, chop fine, and saute in a little oil until translucent, then
  add cabbage and leeks (you will need a good-sized skillet or frying
  pan. I used a wok). Saute vegetables until tender and almost
  transparent, but not too flabby. Set aside.
  
  When the potatoes are done, drain them and give 'em a good shake. Mash
  potatoes well, adding salt and pepper and butter to taste. Then mix
  cabbage and leeks into potatoes and stir well. It should turn a pale
  green color.
  
  There are several things you could do after this point. You could just
  serve it up right away, or you could put it into a baking pan,
  drizzle some melted butter or margarine on top, and put it in the
  oven to brown on top. Or you could put it into a baking dish, top
  with grated cheddar cheese, and put into the oven until cheese is
  bubbly. The third method is my personal favorite.
  
  Note: using instant mashed potatoes totally takes away from the
  flavor and texture of the dish, besides being inauthentic...but then
  again, how authentic is it to prepare a Celtic recipe using a wok?

      Title: COLCANNON LORE
 Categories: Irish, Vegetables, Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  (from IRISH TRADITIONAL FOOD, Theodora Fitzgibbon:)
  
  "This is traditionally eaten in Ireland at Hallowe'en. Until quite
  recently this was a fast day, when no meat was eaten. The name is
  from *cal ceann fhionn* -- white-headed cabbage. Colcannon should
  correctly be made with chopped kale (a member of the cabbage family)
  but it is also made with white cabbage;  an interesting version is
  the Irish Folklore Commission's, which gives it as mashed potatoes
  mixed with onions, butter,and a boiled white cabbage in the center.
  Colcannon at Hallowe'en used to contain a plain gold ring, a
  sixpence, a thimble or button: finding the ring meant marriage within
  the year for the person who found it, the sixpence meant wealth, the
  thimble spinsterhood and the button bachelorhood."
  
  (from THE POOLBEG BOOK OF IRISH TRADITIONAL FOOD:)
  
  "For a dish that is not widely eaten or served today, colcannon
  remains remarkably widely known.  Maybe the song about colcannon is
  better known than the dish. If you say "colcannon" in a crowded room,
  the chances are that half the room will break into one version of the
  song and the other into a completely different version. Like the
  recipe itself, there are two versions commonly known.
  
  Did you ever eat colcannon          Did you ever eat colcannon when
  'twas made with yellow cream   when 'twas made with thickened
                                         cream And the kale and praties
  blended    And the greens and scallions
                                         blended Like the picture in a
  dream? Like the picture in a dream? Did you ever take a forkful Did
  you ever scoop a hole on top And dip it in the lake
                To hold the melting cake Of heather-flavored butter Of
  clover-flavored butter That your mother used to make? Which your
  mother used to make?
  
  Oh, you did, yes you did!             Did you ever eat and eat,
  afraid So did he and so did I,
  :            You'd let the ring go past, And the more I think about
  it And some old married sprissman Sure, the more I want to cry. Would
  get it at the last?
  
                         God be with the happy times
                         When trouble we had not,
                         And our mothers made colcannon
                         In the little three-legged pot. " -- Colcannon
  is so like champ, cally, stampy and poundies that it's difficult to
  understand how it ever came to have a different name. Yet, all over
  the country, colcannon is colcannon and known as nothing else. As in
  the two versions of the song, it can be made with kale or with
  greens, meaning cabbage. Those reared on the version made with kale
  can never understand how the cabbage version can be considered
  colcannon, and vice versa...."

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Coarsely chopped sweet

  2 1/2 c  Cold chicken broth, all fat
           -removed

  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
      1 dr Almond extract (optional)
        pn Of sugar (optional)
           Salt to taste
      2    Jalapeno peppers, seeds and
           -veins removed, cut into
           -very small dice
      3    To 5 tablespoons minced
           -cilantro
           Crisp tortilla chips to
           -accompany
 
  Place the onions in a blender or processor and add 1 cup of the Puree
  as fine as possible.  Peel and chunk in 2 1/2 of the avocados,
  reserving the remaining half for garnish. Puree again, adding broth
  as necessary.
  
  Transfer the soup to a large bowl.  Add any remaining broth the
  buttermilk to the blender and whir briefly to pick as much avocado as
  possible. Add to the soup, along with the extract and sugar, if
  desired.
  
  Both of these rather surprising ingredients enhance avocado when used
  in tiny amounts.  Stir well, taste and adjust the salt. The soup may
  be made to this in advance and refrigerated several hours, but for
  best flavor allow it to warm up a bit before serving.  It should be
  cold but not icy.
  
  Peel the remaining half avocado cut into very thin slices. Divide
  soup-among six serving bowls and top with the sliced avocado, and
  coriander.  Serve accompanied by the tortilla chips.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

  paper towels. Arrange peppers cut side up in prepared baking dish.
  
  Preheat oven to 325F. Mix ricotta, eggs, Parmesan, garlic and
  rosemary in medium bowl.  Season with salt and pepper. Spoon stuffing
  into peppers. Bake until filling begins to set and tops are just
  crusty, about 35 minutes Cool, then cover and refrigerate at least 4
  hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)
  
  FOR DRESSING:  Whisk garlic, vinegar, mustard and tomato paste in

  TO SERVE:  Arrange peppers on platter.  Mix basil into dressing and
  spoon over peppers.  Garnish with olives and serve.
  
  NOTE:  You can stuff and bake the peppers the day before. Serve them
  whole or cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices and fan them on
  plates. Try to purchase peppers with flat, even bottoms so they will
  stand upright during baking.  Serve as an appetizer to a grilled
  chicken or fish dish.

      Title: COLD BUTTERMILK SOUP (KAERNEMAELKSKOLDSKALL)
 Categories: Danish, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Buttermilk
      2    Eggs
      4 tb Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Juice of 1 lemon
 
  Grabbed a little Danish cookbook at a sale this weekend. After going
  through it I've decided that the Danes could give the Japanese a run
  for their money as far as strange and wonderful edibles go. They
  depend heavily on fish and even have a version of sushi that I'll go
  into in some detail later in the packet. There is also a hitherto
  unsuspected connection between Danish food and Mexican food.  It's
  really interesting to see how all these dishes from various countries
  inter-link.
  
  I ran across this early on in the Danish book and it raised my
  eyebrows enough to keep me going...
  
  Beat the eggs, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla together in the bowl
  the soup is to be served in.  Beat the buttermilk and fold in a
  little at a time.
  
  If you want to make something out of this dish, top the bowl with a
  cup of whipped cream.  Small cakes of oat meal, fried in butter and
  sugar, pressed into moistened eggs cups and turned onto a plate, are
  served with this dish.
  
  It can also be served after the main course with whipped cream,
  meringue and sweetened fruit.

      Title: COLD CHICKEN~ CELERY & WALNUT SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Chicken legs
      2    Onions, peeled
      1    Carrot, peeled
      6    Black peppercorns
  1 1/2 l  Water ( 2 1/2 pints)
      2    Heads celery, washed
      3 tb Olive oil
      5    Cloves garlic, peeled
    200 g  Shelled walnuts (7 oz)
      2 tb Yoghurt
           Sea salt
           Black pepper, freshly ground
 
  Remove ALL skin and fat from the chicken legs, place them in a
  saucepan with one of the onions, the carrot, the peppercorns and a
  large pinch of sea salt, cover with the water, bring to the boil and
  simmer for 40-45 minutes.
  
  Halfway through this time, chop up the remaining onion and the celery
  and put them to soften in the olive oil in a heavy, covered pan. When
  they are soft and the chicken is cooked through, strain nearly all
  the stock from round the chicken over the onion and celery and
  continue simmering for another 15-20 minutes.
  
  Strip the chicken meat from the bones and cover it with one spoonful
  or so of stock to keep it moist. Discard the bones and the carrot and
  the whole onion from the stock.
  
  In a large mortar crush the garlic with a little sea salt. Pound the
  walnuts into this until they are quite fine (*). Then pound in the
  chicken meat, which should be quite soft. Bind this mixture with the
  yoghurt, season it with pepper, liquidize the celery soup and stir
  the chicken and nut mixture in.
  
  Chill before eating (**).
  
  (*) You can crush the walnuts in an electric blender first; but do
  not add the garlic, as the blender would have a brutalizing effect on
  its taste.
  
  (**) This soup is best eaten cold, but is also good warm !

      Title: COLD CRABMEAT NACHO
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     24 oz Cream cheese
      2 tb Mayonnaise; the real thing
        ds Tabasco
    1/4 c  Green onions; minced
    1/4 c  Celery; coarsely chopped
        ds Paprika
           Salt and pepper, to taste
      1 cn Black olives; finely
           -chopped (16 oz. can)
    1/2 lb Crabmeat; flaked
      1    Nacho cheese flavor doritos
 
      The best way to prepare this recipe in a food processor, because
  it chops the ingredients finely enough and blends them together for
  you. But if a food processor is not handy, you can use a blender and
  a chef's kniofe.  It will still come out great, no matter how you do
  it!
      First, mix the cream cheese to a pasty consistency. It has to be
  soft and pliable.  THen, in a large mixing bowl, whip together the
  cheese and the mayonnaise until the mixture is smooth. Toss in the
  Tabasco at this point and blend it in, too.  Next, add the minced
  onions, the celery, the seasonings, the finely chopped black olives,
  and the crabmeat. Just put them all together -- it's not necessary to
  add them one at a time. But is *is* necessary to blend them all
  *gently*. If you get rough, you'll smash the ingredients and you'll
  lose the crispness.
      When you're ready to serve, lay out the *whole* bag of Doritos on
  a pizza pan and stuff each one, heaping on the crabmeat mixture and
  sprinkling the tops with paprika. To increase the flavor, put the
  stuffed chips in the refrigerator for an hour or two. Author's note:
  ...While crabmeat is used in the original dish, you can also
  substitute chopped shrimp or crawfish for the crabmeat, and the basic
  mix is also excellent for stuffing avocados, tomatoes, celery stalks,
  and just about anyting your taste dictates. Note from me: I don't
  care for Nacho Cheese Flavor Doritos but instead these are great with
  the unsalted style chips you get with salsa at Mexican restaurants.

    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb (1 1/4 T) soya sauce

      2 ts Sesame oil
 
  Did some rummaging around in my cookbooks and came up with the
  following. This first one sounds like it's on the track of the
  cucumber pickles you had at the Chinese place, though these are
  diced, not sliced and call for sesame oil rather than seeds.
  
  Peel the cucumber and cut into small dice.  Sprinkle with remaining
  ingredients and leave for 5 minutes before serving. Make sure sugar
  has dissolved before serving.

 Categories: Seafood, Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Dry white wine
      8    Basil leaves
      3    Tarragon (plus more for garn
           -sh)

      7 lb Whole salmon, cleaned, rinse
           -, patted dry
      8 c  Fish aspic  (see recipe)
      1    Turnip
      1    Egg yolk, hard cooked, mashe
      1 ts Unsalted butter
 
  In a small saucepan, combine the wine, basil, 3 tarragon sprigs,
  shallots, rosemary, lemon, and celery. Simmer the mixture for 20
  minutes or until the liquid is reduced to about 3 Tbsp. Lay the
  salmon on a piece of heavy foil, twice as long as the fish. Pick up
  edges of foil and pour the wine mixture over the fish. Season with
  salt and fold the foil to enclose it, crimping the edges tightly to
  secure them. Put the salmon on a large baking sheet or roasting pan
  and bake it in the middle of a preheated 375f oven for 50-60 minutes
  or until the fish just flakes. Transfer the package to a work
  surface, open foil carefully, and remove the skin from the top of the
  salmon below the head to the bottom of the salmon at the tail. Scrape
  away any brown flesh, leaving head and tail intact. Drain liquid from
  the foil, and using the foil as a guide, invert the fish onto a
  platter. Remove foil and skin and prepare the other side of the
  salmon in the same manner. Chill the fish, covered, overnight. Peel
  turnip and cut into thin slices. Trim each slice to ressemble a
  flower or cut with a flower cutter. Place in a bowl of ice water to
  hold until ready for use. Mash the egg yolk with the butter and
  reserve at room temperature. Spoon a thin coat of cool but liquid
  fish aspic over the salmon and arrange the additional tarragon sprigs
  and turnip flowers decoratively on the fish. Spoon a thin coat of
  liquid aspic over the whole. Transfer the yolk mixture to a pastry
  bag fitted with a decorative tip. Pipe the mixture into the centers
  of the flowers. Chill the salmon for at least 2 hours or up to 6
  hours. Serve surrounded with the chilled aspic, chopped. a 1964

  over medium heat for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the
  chicken to cool in the liquid.  When it is cool, skin and boned the

  Beat together egg yolks and sugar.  Grate rinds of lemons (I don't use
  this) and squeeze out juice, measuring out 2/3 cups lemon juice. Add
  rind to the egg yolks, then gradually add the 2/3 cups lemon juice,
  beating all the while.  (This "cooks" the egg yolk.) Soften the
  gelatin in 1/2 cup of hot water and beat until it is dissolved. Allow
  to cool slightly. Whip the cream lightly and stir into lemon mixture;
  then stir in gelatin and continue stirring until mixture begins to
  thicken. Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until stiff but not
  dry; fold into lemon mixture. Spoon souffle into dish and chill in

 Categories: Entrees, Chinese, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Garlic, minced (fresh)
      3 tb Coriander, minced
           -(fresh)
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
      5 oz Soy sauce, light
      5 tb Sugar
           Rice wine (between
           -1/2 t to 1 T)
      1 tb Hot bean paste
           -(up to 2 T)
      1 tb Sesame oil
      1 lb Lo mein noodles (other
           -noodles will do,
           -such as ramen noodles,
           -or even spaghetti)
 
  Cook the lo mein according to directions.  Let cool. Mix the rest of
  the ingredients.  Peanut butter doesn't mix very well, so for a few
  minutes you'll think you've made a mistake. Don't worry, just keep
  stirring until it's smooth. Add the sauce to the noodles.
  
  Hot bean sauce also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc. This is
  the main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care. Vary this
  ingredient to taste. This recipe is probably very good without it.
  It's also quite good served when the noodles are still hot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Mildly spicy cold noodles -- I first had this at Brandy Ho's in
  Chinatown, San Francisco. I forget where I found the recipe.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.

      Title: COLD TROUT IN ORANGE MARINADE
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Trout (about 3/4 lb each),
           Gutted and scaled but with
           Heads and tails left on
    1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
    1/2 c  Flour, spread on a plate
      2 tb Onion, chopped very fine
      1 c  Dry white Italian vermouth
      2 tb Chopped orange peel, using
           Only the rind, not the pith
    1/2 c  Freshly squeezed orange
           Juice
           Freshly squeezed juice of
           One lemon
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
  1 1/2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  1.  Wash the gutted, scaled fish in cold water and pat thoroughly dry
      with paper towels. 2. Put the oil in a skillet and turn on the
  heat to medium.  When the
      oil is hot, lightly dredge both sides of the fish in flour and
  slip
      into the skillet.  Don't overcrowd the pan; if all the fish does
  not
      fit loosely at one time, cook it in batches, dredging it in flour
  only
      at the moment you are ready to put it into the pan. 3. Brown the
  fish well on one side, then turn it and do the other,
      calculating about 5 minutes on the first side and
        4    minutes on the
      second.  Using a slotted spatula or spoon, transfer the fish when
      browned to a deep serving dish broad or long enough to accommodate
      all of it without overlapping.  Do not pour out the oil in the
      skillet. 4. With a well-sharpened knife, make two or three
  diagonal cuts on both
      side of the fish.  be careful not to tear the skin, and avoid
  cutting
      into the flesh. 5. Put the chopped onion into the skillet that
  still contains the oil in
      which you cooked the fish.  Turn on the heat to medium and cook
  the
      onion until it becomes colored a pale gold. 6. Add the vermouth
  and the orange peel.  Let the vermouth bubble gently
      for about 30 seconds, stir, then add the orange juice, lemon
  juice,
      salt, and a few grindings of pepper.  Let everything bubble for
  about
      half a minute, stirring two or three times.  Add the chopped
  parsley,
      stir once or twice, then pour the entire contents of the skillet
  over
      the fish in the serving dish. 7. Allow the fish to steep in its
  marinade at room temperature for at
      least 6 hours before refrigerating.  Plan to serve the fish no
  sooner
      than the following day.  Do serve it within 3 days at the latest
  to
      enjoy its flavor at its freshest.  Take it out of the refrigerator
      at least 2 hours before bringing to the table to allow it to come
  to
      room temperature.  Before serving, garnish it, if you like, with
      fresh slices of orange. ~--

  Joyce Jue comes through again!  You owe it to yourself to try this
  method of cooking if you like pork, Chinese food or both. It's an
  absurdly simple way to produce delicious foods. If you don't like
  pork, fix this using a chicken.
  
  Fresh ham or a fairly fat cut of pork is traditionally used for this
  recipe, but boneless lean pork loin makes a delicious and leaner
  substitute.  For a nontraditional presentation, serve the pork with
  grilled asparagus spears, Asian eggplant and/or zucchini slices. Or,
  arrange the slices on a bed of watercress with strips of roasted
  pepper and serve as a first course salad.  Or, simply alternate the
  pork with thin rounds of chilled cucumber.
  
  Bring the water to a boil in a large pot, then add the pork, green
  onions, ginger, garlic and wine.  Bring to a boil again. Skim off the
  scum that rises to surface. Cover, reduce heat low and simmer for 45
  minutes.
  
  When the meat is done, half fill a large pan with cold water and ice
  cubes. Remove the meat from the pot and immediately plunge it into
  the ice water; let sit for 20 minutes to firm up the meat and juices.
  Remove pork, pat dry, cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled,
  at least 2 to 3 hours, or overnight.
  
  GARLIC SESAME SAUCE:  Mix together all ingredients.
  
  To serve:  Cut the meat crosswise into paper-thin slices (no thicker
  than 1/8 inch) and arrange in a circular pattern on a plate. Serve
  sauce on the side or drizzle it over the pork. Garnish with fresh
  coriander leaves.
  
  Serves 8 to 10.

 Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Salads, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 md Whole red cabbage
      2 sm Carrots; grated
    1/4 lb Spanish onion; thinly sliced
    1/4 lb Red onion; thinly sliced
      1 sm Green cabbage; shredded

MMMMM--------------------VINAIGRETTE DRESSING-------------------------
      2 tb White wine vinegar
      1 pn Each dry mustard and salt
      6    To 8 tb. olive oil
    1/2 ts Caraway seeds
           -- (or more to taste)
    1/3 c  Chopped fresh herbs*
      1 pn Sugar, or as required, &/or
           Lemon juice; as required
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  *Fresh herbs should be a mixture of parsley, chives, chervil and
  basil.
  
  The author suggests serving this salad at a picnic.
  
  To make the cabbage "bowl," use a sharp knife and cut a lid one
  quarter of the way from the top (not stem) end of the red cabbage.
  Using a grapefruit knife, cut out most of the interior cabbage from
  the lid, leaving a shell 1/4" thick.  Set aside.  Remove inner
  cabbage from "bowl," leaving a sturdy 1/4" shell.  With a sharp
  knife, trim off stem end so shell sits firmly. Shred cut red cabbage,
  discarding any tough leaves or pieces.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, toss together carrots, onions and shredded
  red and green cabbage.
  
  To make the vinaigrette, whisk together vinegar with the mustard and
  salt. Slowly add oil by drops until smooth and thickened. Add caraway
  seeds and chopped herbs. Taste and add sugar and/or lemon juice and
  pepper.
  
  Toss cabbage mixture with vinaigrette.  Cover and chill cole slaw,
  overnight if desired.  To serve, fill cabbage bowl with slaw, top
  with lid (and press firmly, securing with foil if transporting to a
  picnic site.)
  
  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: COLESLAW (CARTER FAMILY FAVORITES)
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 ea Green cabbage heads,fresh*
      2 ea Apples,crisp,peeled/cored
      6 ea Crisp celery stalks
      6 ea Carrots,scraped/washed
      1 tb Celery seed
      1 ts Salt
      1 pt Mayonnaise
 
  * - don't bother if the cabbage is the white limp variety - your slaw
  won't be worth the makings.
  
  1. Cut the cabbage in quarters, place in a large bowl of well-salted
  cold water, and let stand for at least 1 hour. This is to make sure
  any possible "critters" emerge - nothing spoils good slaw like a
  many-footed friend. Once soaked, drain and place the cabbage on a
  large chopping board and chop away like mad. The cabbage must be very
  finely shredded. Dump into a big bowl and shred the apples, celery,
  and carrots. Add to cabbage, stir in celery seed, salt, and
  mayonnaise, and blend well. 2. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before
  serving to allow flavors to mellow. If slaw is to be transported to
  fish fry site, keep very cold - mayonnaise mixture can be deadly if
  allowed to stand too long at room temperature.

 Categories: Salads, Untested
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Head cabbage
           Salt

MMMMM-----------------SUGGESTIONS TO ADD VARIETY----------------------
           Thinly sliced red or yellow
           -or green onions
           Red cabbage
           Grated carrots
           Bean sprouts
 
  What makes coleslaw really good is the "pickling" of the cabbage.
  First you slice the cabbage real thin layering it in a bowl with a
  generous amount of salt (you will eventually wash all this salt
  away), then you place the cabbage/salt mixture in a warm place for a
  few hours until the cabbage is wilted and well...pickled. My father
  used to place the cabbage directly on top of one of the big
  refrigerator compressors in the back room. Once "pickled" thoroughly
  wash to remove as much salt as possible.
  
  Add optional ingredients as desired.
  
  Now for the dressings.  Mayo is out but there are lots of
  alternatives. Balsamic or rice vinegar to taste (if you pickle the
  cabbage first you'll need less vinegar). Or, vinegar, ginger and
  sugar and roasted mustard seed (add a nice look and crunch, to roast
  the mustard seed, heat a heavy saute pan and add the seed to the hot
  dry pan for about 30 seconds to a minute). Or, vinegar, and a good
  dijon mustard.
  
  Remember to let the slaw sit in its dressing for a while before
  serving. Recipe from Veggie Life recipe archives Submitted by Nancy

      1 md Onion, finely chopped
           Ginger root (1 inch),
           -peeled and grated
      2    Green chilies, seeded
           -and finely chopped
      3    Cloves, whole
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed
    1/4 ts Aniseed
    1/4 ts Caraway seed
    1/4 ts Fenugreek seed
    1/2 ts Coriander seed
    1/2 ts Cumin seed
           Cinnamon bark, broken
           -(1 inch)
      3    Cardamom pods, crushed
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Chile powder
     12 oz Tomatoes
           -(one large tin)
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Corn oil

MMMMM----------------------------RICE---------------------------------
      2 ts Corn oil
      2    Cloves
      3    Cardamom pods, crushed
           Cinnamon bark
           -(1/2 inch)
      2 c  Basmati rice
      1 ts Turmeric
      4 c  Water, boiling
      1    Bay leaf
 
  MAKE CURRY:  Fry the onion in a heavy casserole in the corn oil until
  it begins to soften.  Stir in the garlic, ginger and chilies. Reduce
  heat and fry gently for awhile.
  
  Meanwhile, toast the hard seeds and cinnamon in a dry heavy frying pan
  until they begin to pop. Grind the toasted seeds into a fine powder
  and add to the frying mixture together with the chile powder and the
  turmeric.
  
  Add the chopped tinned tomatoes and stir in with about 1 t salt. If
  the mixture is dry, add a little water or stock. Cover and allow to
  simmer gently for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
  
  Trim the fat off the pre-cooked meat and cut into bite sized pieces.
  When the sauce has simmered for the 2 hours, switch off and stir in
  the meat. Leave to stand preferably overnight, and re-heat before
  eating.
  
  MAKE RICE:  Heat corn oil in a large saucepan with a tight-fitting
  lid. Add cloves, crushed cardamom pods and cinnamon. Add rice and
  turmeric and mix well by swishing the pan round. Add boiling water
  and bay leaf and stir.
  
  Cover and simmer gently for 12-15 minutes, until all the water has
  been absorbed.  Use a fork to remove the seeds and bay leaf and turn
  out into a warmed dish. Allow to stand in a warm place for 5 to 10
  minutes and fluff up with a fork before serving.
  
  The sauce can be prepared in advance, to use with leftover meat, or
  you can NOTES:
  
  *  An Indian-style meat curry -- Having experimented with making
  Indian-style dishes for a long time, I have found that this one works
  every time and has met with approval from all who have tried it.
  Yield: Serves 3-4.
  
  *  cook the meat and sauce to order.
  
  *  Plain yoghurt may be substituted for the tomatoes if preferred.
  
  *  Experiment with the seasonings.  As a guide, ginger and chile
  powder will increase the heat, coriander will increase the sweetness,
  and fenugreek and cumin will increase the bitterness.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours cooking, overnight wait.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Pkg (18.5 oz) yellow
           Cake mix **
    1/8 ts Baking soda
      2    Eggs
    3/4 c  COCA-COLA
      1 c  Bananas, ripe and mashed
      2 ts Lemon juice
    1/3 c  Nuts, finely chopped (opt)

MMMMM---------------------SEA FOAM FROSTING--------------------------
      2    Egg whites
  1 1/2 c  (firmly packed) light
           Brown sugar
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar *
    1/3 c  COCA-COLA
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Dash salt
 
  *  Do not use a mix with pudding added or which requires oil.
  
  *  you may substitute 1 tablespoon corn syrup.
  
  TO MAKE THE CAKE:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cake mix,
  baking soda, and eggs.  Measure the Coca-Cola, stir briskly until the
  foaming stops; add to the batter. Blend ingredients just until
  moistened, then beat at high speed of an electric mixer for 3
  minutes, scraping the bowl often.
  
  In a bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the lemon juice; add to the
  batter.  Add the chopped nuts to the batter and beat for 1 minute at
  medium speed.  Turn the batter into a well-greased, lightly floured,
  13x9x2-inch pan.
  
  Bake in a preheated, 350 degree F oven for about 40 minutes or until
  the cake tests done.  Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, remove cake from
  pan and turn right-side up on a rack to finish cooling.
  
  TO MAKE THE SEA FOAM FROSTING:  In the top of a double boiler,
  combine all the ingredients except the vanilla extract. Beat 1 minute
  at high speed of an electric mixer. Place over boiling water (the
  water should not touch the bottom of the top half of the double
  boiler.). Beat on high speed about 7 minutes until the frosting forms
  peaks when the mixer is raised.
  
  Remove from boiling water (for the smoothest frosting, empty into a
  large bowl).  Add the vanilla extract and continue beating on high
  speed until thick enough to spread, about 2 minutes. Spread on the
  sides and top of the cold banana cake.

      Title: COLONEL HATCH'S CHORIZO
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Hatch red enchilada sauce
      3 ts Oregano
    1/2 c  Dried red chiles; ground
  2 1/2 lb Lean ground beef (or half
           -beef; half pork, ground)
 
  Colonel Hatch's Chorizo (from the Hatch Chile Cookbook)
  
  NOTE: Use only ground beef or beef and pork mixture in this recipe.
  
  Mix the enchilada sauce and the oregano with the ground chile. Put
  the meat in a large glass bowl or non-reactive pan. Cover the meat
  with the sauce and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Next, pour
  off any excess liquid. To cook, crumble the desired amount with a
  fork and fry in a skillet. The chorizo may be frozen into serving
  size packages, or may be stuffed into sausage casings. Makes 40
  sausages. *Please note: recipe requires advance preparation.
  
  Dot's notes: I used half ground beef, half ground pork, dried
  oregano, and Hatch-brand enchilada sauce. Now you know why I'm always
  on the prowl for Hatch-brand stuff in Michigan. This recipe makes a
  lot of chorizo. I divided it into some 4 and some 8 oz. portions,
  wrapped it tightly in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil and froze it.
  It makes absolutely wonderful breakfast burritos and you can also use
  it in the Blue Cornbread and Chorizo stuffing recipe found in Steven
  Pyle's New Texas Cuisine. Enjoy.

      Title: COLORFUL MARZIPAN FRUITS
 Categories: Candies, Christmas
      Yield: 24 Candies
 
MMMMM-----------------------BASIC MARZIPAN----------------------------
     16 oz Almond paste
      2    Egg whites
    1/2 ts Extract, almond
      4 c  Sugar, powdered

MMMMM------------------------CANDY MAKING-----------------------------
           Cloves, whole
           Egg whites
           Food coloring, paste
           Kirsch; or vodka
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Syrup, corn, light
           Sugar, red
 
  TO AVOID HARMFUL BACTERIA, BE SURE EGGS ARE NOT CRACKED BEFORE USE.
  There are 4 steps to making colorful marzipan fruits: making basic
  marzipan, shaping fruits, coloring fruits; glazing fruits. MAKE THE
  BASIC MARZIPAN. Break up almond paste in large bowl. Add egg whites
  and almond extract and mix thoroughly. Add sugar 1 cup at a time,
  kneading well after each addition; add enough sugar to make a solid,
  heavy dough. (The mixture is quite sticky and hard to handle at
  first, but as you add sugar, it dries and becomes workable.) At this
  point you may store the dough for up to 7 days by wrapping in plastic
  and storing in plastic bag in fridge. Bring to room temp and knead
  again before using. SHAPE MARZIPAN FRUITS: break off 1" balls of
  marzipan and shape to look like lemons, oranges, apples, pears, and
  strawberries. too much while you are shaping balls, chill briefly in
  fridge. Shaping tips: Lemons and oranges: roll on fine grated to
  create pebbly texture; insert cloves, star-shaped ends up, for stem
  ends. Apples: indent tops, insert cloves pointed ends up to represent
  stems. Pears: insert cloves pointed ends up for stems. Strawberries:
  shape little flat marzipan stars to make caps; attach caps with
  cloves and a dab of egg white. COLOR FRUITS: Use small, soft
  paintbrush and paste food coloring diluted with a little kirsch.  Mix
  colors (a gem muffin pan makes a good palette) and paint each fruit
  completely. Don't forget to pain the strawberry caps green.  Place
  painted fruits on wire rack to dry overnight; turn occasionally so
  they dry evenly. GLAZE FRUITS: in small saucepan, sitr together water
  and corn syrup to make glaze. Bring to boil, remove from heal, and
  allow to cool until just warm. Brush warm glaze on red part of each
  strawberry; sprinkle with red sugar and place on wire rack to dry
  overnight.  Brush warm glaze on each fruit and let dry overnight on
  wire rack.  When glaze is dry on strawberries, paint glaze on
  strawberry caps and let dry overnight. Put marzipan fruits in paper
  candy cups and store in airtight container. Brightly colored marzipan
  fruits are so festive and pretty, somehow they suit the holiday
  perfectly.

  water (for the smoothest frosting, empty into a large bowl). Add the
  vanilla extract and continue beating on high speed until thick enough
  to spread, about 2 minutes.  Spread on the sides and top of the cold
  banana cake.  From: "International Cooking with Coca-Cola", a give

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Coconut (or 1.1/2 cups
           -canned unsweetened coconut
           -milk mixed
           With 1.1/2 cups water)
      3 c  Long grain rice
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2    Inch piece of ginger,
           -peeled, sliced very thin,
           -stacked, and
           Cut into thin sticks
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
 
  Buddha rice is a vegetarian dish honored by all Vietnamese and is
  eaten on certain days of the month that have religious significance
  and during the moon's full phase. This recipe comes from Binh's aunt
  (Binh is the author of the cookbook), one of his first cooking
  teachers.
  
  1. To make coconut milk from a fresh coconut, take a hammer or heavy
  cleaver and hit the coconut over a sink all around the center,
  forming a circle. The coconut should break in half easily; if not,
  hit it a few more times. Discard the water that comes from the middle
  and remove the outer shell. Cut the halves in smaller pieces. Peel
  each piece, then gate or shred the coconut. Put the coconut meat in a
  medium bowl and cover with 2 cups hot water. Let stand for about 8
  minutes, then pour the coconut mixture through a fine strainer placed
  over a bowl. Press hard to extract as much "cream" as possible. Add
  enough water to make three cups coconut liquid or combine the canned
  unsweetened coconut milk with water.
  
  2. Rinse the rice in several changes of water and drain well in a
  colander. Let the rice dry in the colander, shaking it occasionally.
  
  3. In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add
  the ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the rice
  and cook, stirring to coat it well, about 2 minutes. Stir in the
  salt, bay leaf, coconut liquid, and soy sauce and bring to a boil.
  Let the rice cook without stirring, uncovered, until the liquid
  settles and holes form all over the top, about 5 minutes. reduce the
  heat to very low, cover tightly, and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from
  the heat and let the rice rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Uncover and
  stir the rice to fluff it up. Serve hot. The rice can sit, covered,
  for up to 1 hour before serving.

 Categories: Soups, Untested
      Yield: 1 Servings

MMMMM------------------------COMBINATIONS-----------------------------
      2    Peeled stalks of broccoli
           -or 1c florets, chopped
           Dried onion
           Veg bouillon

MMMMM-----------------------------OR----------------------------------
      2    Carrots, chopped
    1/4 ts Curry powder

MMMMM-----------------------------OR----------------------------------
      1 c  Mushrooms
      1 tb Wine (1-3T)

MMMMM-----------------------------OR----------------------------------
      2    Stalks celery, chopped
    1/4 ts Tarragon, marjoram, or
           -savory

MMMMM-----------------------------OR----------------------------------
      1 pk Frozen spinach or kale
           Grated nutmeg
    1/4 ts Lemon juice

MMMMM-----------------------------OR----------------------------------
      1 c  Frozen corn
      1 ts Fresh parsely

MMMMM-----------------------------OR----------------------------------
      1 c  Frozen peas
    1/8 ts Each of ginger and pepper
      1 ts Vinegar (1-3t)

MMMMM-----------------------------OR----------------------------------
      1    Sweet potato or half an
           -acorn squash, peeled and
           -chopped
    1/2 ts Italian herb mixture
 
  Simmer the soup until the veggies are tender.  Puree in blender or
  food processor until smooth.  Add salt/pepper to taste.
  
  Sally's notes:  Instead of stock of bouillon cubes, you can take out
  1/2c soup after pureeing and dissolve a T of miso in it, then return
  it to the pot and mix. Almost all the combos are good with the
  addition of 1/2 an onion and a clove or two of garlic sauteed in
  sherry. Other possible additions (not combined of course) include: 1T
  tomato paste, 1/2c leftover beans or grains, a few dried mushrooms or
  dried tomatoes, a few tablespoons of sauerkraut, a T of capers or
  chopped pickle added before serving, toasted pumpkin/squash seeds or
  wheat germ sprinkled on top.

      Title: CONCIA
 Categories: Italian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4    Eggplant or 8 zucchini
    3/4    To 1 cup olive oil
      2 tb Salt
      2 tb Freshly ground black pepper
      6    Garlic cloves, peeled,
           -shaved
      6 tb Fresh thyme, oregano or
           -marjoram, chopped
    1/2    To 3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
 
  Leah Bergen of the new Cafe Fontebella in Oakland says Concia
  originated in the Jewish ghetto in Rome. She learned to make it from
  her grandmother and mother, and has since adapted it to the
  restaurants where she has cooked. For garlic lovers, this dish is
  heaven.
  
  Slice the eggplant (or zucchini) 3/8 inch thick. Brush with 3 to 4
  tablespoons of the olive oil. Grill until golden, about 10 minutes of
  the eggplant, 6 to 8 minutes for the zucchini.
  
  Arrange a layer of vegetables in a clean glass jar or dish with a lid.
  Sprinkle with some of the salt, pepper, shaved garlic and herbs.
  Continue until all the vegetables are used. Combine remaining olive
  oil and vinegar pour over the vegetables. Refrig- erate. Turn every
  day for 1 week.
  
  Makes 1 quart.

      Title: CONCIA ( MARINATED ZUCCHINI)
 Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers, Italian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Zucchini
           Olive oil
           Garlic; minced
           Basil, fresh; shredded

           Wine vinegar
 
  No quantities are given "as they are not important; Concia can be
  prepared to be more less piquant, according to taste, by increasing
  or decreasing the quantity of herbs and spices. It freezes
  beautifully in a tightly closed container, but it must be used within
  a few days if stored in the refrigerator or after thawing, being a
  rather perishable food. Eggplant was also prepared as Concia in Rome,
  but its texture is less desirable than eggplant. Trim off the ends of
  the zucchini; then cut each one in half; slice each half thinly
  lengthwise and place slices on paper towel to dry for several hours
  or overnight. Fry in hot olive oil in a single layer until golden
  brown on both sides. Arrange in layers in glass, plastic or porcelain
  container and season each layer with small amounts of garlic, basil,
  salt and pepper, and a sprinkle of vinegar. Cover the container and
  store in the refrigerator at least several hours before using. The
  flavour will be enhanced if you turn the Concia as a block inside the
  container a few times while it is marinating to allow the juices to
  seep through.

           -(your choice),
           - enough for
      2    -9" crusts)
      3 lb Concord grapes; washed
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1    Lemon; zest and juice
      3 tb Flour
      1    Egg yolk (optional)
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Make the crust, line a pan and roll out the 2nd
  crust. Refrigerate both while you make the filling. If you have the
  larger amount of grapes, use a deeper pie tin. Slip the grapes from
  their skins, working directly into a sauce pan. Put the skins into a
  bowl. Cook the grapes until they turn whitish and the seeds are
  loosened, about 3 minutes. Pass them through a food mill to get rid
  of the seeds, working directly into the bowl with the skins. Stir in
  the lower amount of sugar, the lemon zest and the flour. Taste and if
  more sugar is needed, add the rest. Add the lemon juice, to taste.
  Let cook for 15 minutes. Pour the filling into the shell and cover
  with the 2nd crust. Crimp the edges together well so that the juice
  doesn't leak out. For a more golden crust, brush the top with a
  little beaten egg yolk. With the tip of a knife, etch a decorative
  design over the top. Or cut some grape leaves out of the scraps of
  dough and fasten them to the crust with a little egg yolk or water.
  Bake for 10 minutes in the lower 3rd of the oven then reduce heat to
  350F. Bake another 35 minutes or until the crust is nicely browned.
  Cool before serving.

 Categories: Columbian, Game, Rabbit, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This recipe comes from Colombia in South America. Rabbit meat is very
  low in fat and can be dry tasting, so it marries well with coconut
  cream. It is best to cook the rabbit gently till it is falling off
  the bone.
  
  Chop a rabbit into serving pieces.  Chop finely one large onion and 2
  cloves of garlic.  Seed and slice a large green capsicum, half a
  large red capsicum and finely slice 3 birdseye chillies (decrease the
  quantity and discard the seeds if you can't cope with too much chilli
  heat). Peel and chop a large tomato and have ready 400 ml strong veal
  or chicken stock and
      150 ml coconut cream.
  
  Heat a little oil in a frying pan and brown the rabbit pieces.
  Transfer them to a large saucepan.  In the remaining oil in the
  frying pan, saute the onions, capsicums and chillies. Add to the
  saucepan with the tomato, salt and pepper to taste, and the stock.
  Bring just to simmering point, cover and cook very gently for about 2
  hours or even more. Lift the rabbit pieces out onto a dish and turn
  the heat up high under the saucepan. Reduce the liquid in the
  saucepan by about half.
  
  Lower the heat and stir in the coconut cream.  Return the rabbit
  pieces and cook gently, stirring, for a few minutes. Serve with rice.

  Toss the carrots,red pepper and chives.The salad tends to clump,so a
  large fork works better than a spoon.Let it sit for 10 minutes or so
  to develop flavor,then add sugar to taste.The amount needed will not
  be constant,since carrots and apples both vary greatly in
  sweetness.Makes 6 to 8 servings..

      1 sl Ginger root; minced

  In all my years of eating and cooking Chinese food, I'd never tried
  Congee (rice gruel) before yesterday. It just seemed so *bland* that
  I thought it couldn't possibly be all that interesting. I was WRONG!
  The recipe below gives a subtle but hearty "soup" which can be
  garnished in a virtually infinite number of ways according to
  personal taste. I found that I like just the basic stuff,
  unembellished the best. I substituted half a cup of long grain rice
  and half a cup of glutinous rice for the long grain rice and it
  worked very well. The preserved turnip seems to be used mostly for
  its salt content. I found it unnecessary to add any more salt to the
  congee. The tangerine peel gives a very subtle, nice hint of exotic
  perfume to the dish. The pot I made set up almost like a pea soup
  when it cooled. Good stuff! Ridiculously easy too...

      6 c  All-purpose flour (approx)
           Shortening (soft)
      1    Egg white; unbeaten
 
  Measure warm, not hot, water into bowl.  Sprinkle dry yeast over
  water; stir until dissolved.  Add sugar, salt, and 3 cups flour. Stir
  to mix; then beat until smooth. Stir in 3 cups more flour.
  
  Turn dough out onto lighlty floured board.  Knead until smooth and
  elastic, about 10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, and brush the top
  with soft shortening. Cover. Let rise in warm place, free from draft,
  until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch dough down and turn out onto lightly floured board. Divide
  dough in half.  Form each half into a roll about 10 inches long.
  Cover and let rest 5 minutes. Cut into 10 equal pieces and form into
  smooth balls. Place balls about 3 inches apart on a lightly greased
  baking sheet. With scissors, make a cross 1/2 inch deep in the top of
  each roll by making two snips at right angles to each other. Cover
  and let rise until doubled.
  
  Bake at 425 degrees for 15 ot 20 minutes.  Remove from oven. Brush
  rolls with egg white and reutrn to oven for 2 minutes. Remove from
  baking sheet. Serve either hot or cold.
  
  Note: This makes a crusty roll very similar to the long loaves found
  in France.

  best that I have tried.
  
  In a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat, heat the vegetable oil and
  add the garlic and onion cooking for about 10 minutes, stirring
  frequently, until tender. Add the tomatoes and liquid, tomato puree,
  wine, sugar, basil, oregano and thyme and bring to a boil. Reduce the
  heat to low and simmer the sauce, covered, 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
  prepare the rice according to the directions on the package and set
  aside, covered to keep warm. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  In a
  medium-size skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, stirring,
  until well browned. Remove from the heat and drain off the excess
  fat. Stir in the rice, 1/2 cup of the sauce and season with salt and
  pepper to taste. Spoon the mixture into the pepper halves and place
  the peppers, filling side down, in a 13 X 9 X2-inch baking pan. Pour
  the remaining sauce over the peppers and cover with foil. Bake for 35

      Title: CONVERTING BREAD RECIPES FOR BREADMAKER
 Categories: Abm, Breadmaker
      Yield: 1 Hints
 
           COPYRIGHT 1994 S. STEIGER
 
  1. Calculate the number of "loaves" in a non-ABM recipe by allowing 3
  cups of flour per "loaf" (or 2 cups flour for a 1-lb machine).
  Rounding off is fine; if a recipe calls for 5 cups flour, I figure
  that's close enough to 2 loaves for government work. Remember to add
  in ALL the flours, if there's bread flour plus WW flour plus rye
  flour plus ... you get the idea. Most handmade bread recipes seem to
  make 2 loaves.
  
       2.    Have MM resize it to 1 loaf.
  
  3. Manually change the yeast and sugar amounts to whatever suits your
  machine.  In my R2D2, 1/2 tb yeast and 1/2 tb sugar are optimum. (If
  you don't know what works best in your machine, don't try altering
  recipes yet! Try a number of different ABM recipes and start looking
  for a pattern. What amounts give the best results?) If the amount the
  resized recipe calls for is dramatically different from what you know
  works in your machine, don't worry.  Stick with what works in your
  machine. (This does not apply to sweet breads; since my R2D2 doesn't
  produce usable sweet breads, I've not tried to convert sweet bread
  recipes and have no guidelines to suggest.)
  
  4. Add the dry ingredients and oil/butter/eggs to the machine.
  Measure out the liquid and pour in HALF of the measured amount. (If
  your machine calls for putting in the liquid first, and you're
  terrified to use a different ingredient order, put only HALF the
  measured amount of liquid in.) Start the machine and let knead a few
  minutes. Add remaining liquid, a little at a time, until the dough is
  the right consistency. (Again, if you haven't used your ABM enough to
  recognize the right consistency when you see/feel it, don't start
  adapting recipes yet.) You may need to add more liquid, or you may
  have liquid left over. Make a note of how much liquid you actually
  used.
  
  5. When the bread is done, evaluate.  Didn't rise enough? Add another
  1/8 cup liquid next time. Overflowed? Reduce the liquid by 1/8 cup. I
  don't remember the last time I had to adjust anything except the
  liquid.

 Categories: Appetizers, Beef, Chinese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Raw shrimp, peeled and
           -deveined
      2    Chicken breasts, skinned,
           -boned, and sliced very
           -thin, across grain

    1/2    Head Chinese cabbage or 1
           -lettuce heart, coarsely
           -cubed
      1 c  Cubed egg plant or 1 5-ounce
           -can (2/3 cup) water
           -chestnuts,
           Drained and thinly sliced
  1 1/2 c  Halved fresh mushrooms
      4 c  Small spinach leaves (stems
           -removed)
     14 oz Cans (5 1/4 cups) chicken
           -broth
      3    Chicken bouillon cubes
      1 tb Monosodium glutamate
    1/2 tb Grated gingerroot or 1/2
           -teaspoon ground ginger
 
  Midnight supper, perhaps for New Year's Eve or after the show, can be
  exotic in a hurry. The foods are sliced ahead, the sauces made, then
  all stowed in the refrigerator. When guests are hungry, the hostess
  simply heats the broth and sets out the makings.
  
  Genghis Khan hot pot is another name for this Chinese specialty. Or
  maybe you've seen it on restaurant menus as volcano soup. We show an
  honest-to-goodness Mongolian cooker with a charcoal chimney in the
  center, but any chafing dish or electric skillet will do as well.
  
  What's cooking. Everything on the tray is raw, of course--chunks of
  eggplant, crosscut strips of sirloin, halved mushrooms, thin slices of
  chicken breast, squares of Chinese cabbage, shucked shrimp. Fresh
  spinach to simmer along with the other foods is ready in the big red
  bowl. The broth is chicken bouillon that boasts a faint overtone of
  ginger. Individual bowls of fluffy rice are served at the same time
  as Hot Pot.
  
  The how-to. You pick out a few choice tidbits at a time and drop them
  from chopsticks, bamboo tongs, or fork into the lazily bubbling
  broth. In a few minutes, fish them out to dip into zesty sauces on
  your plate, like Peanut or Red Sauce, Chinese Mustard or Ginger Soy.
  
  Traditionalists poach eggs in the broth when it has taken on subtle
  flavor from the foods that have simmered in it. At the very last, the
  hostess may ladle the broth as a soup. It's delicious! Dessert? Skip
  it, or serve a fruit bowl and candied ginger with coffee or tea.
  
  Etiquette: Use one set of chopsticks for cooking and fishing out
  morsels from Hot Pot, use a second set for eating. If only one set is
  provided for each guest, simply reverse your chopsticks (large ends
  down) when you cook or help yourself to food.
  
  Oriental Hot Pot
  
  Chinese Mustard Ginger Soy Peanut Sauce Red Sauce Hot cooked rice
  
  Shortly before cooking time arrange the meats and vegetables on large
  tray or platter; use a bowl for spinach. Set out dunking sauces.
  Provide Bamboo tongs, chopsticks or long-handled forks as cooking
  tools for guests.
  
  Heat chicken broth in electric skillet or chafing dish (or use
  Mongolian cooker-- directions follow). Add bouillon cubes to hot
  broth and stir to dissolve; add monosodium glutamate and ginger. Heat
  to simmering. For cooking have broth barely bubbling. Each Guest
  picks up desired foods with chopsticks or whatever, drops them into
  the bubbling broth. When his tidbits are cooked, he lifts them out
  and dips into the sauces on his plate. Serve with rice. Makes 4
  servings.
  
  To use Mongolian cooker, fill chimney of cooker with charcoal and add
  charcoal starter. Pour cold chicken broth into cooker. Cover cooker,
  then light charcoal. When broth is hot, continue as above.

      Title: COOK'S TREAT CHICKEN
 Categories: Chicken, Original, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Whole frying chicken with
           -giblets
      4    Pieces of oatmeal bread
      4    Or 5 scallions
    1/2 lb Or so button mushrooms
      1 bn Parsley
      2    Eggs, beaten
           Salt
    1/2 lb Or so of soft butter
 
  The second dish, though it's equally cheap and good, takes a bit
  longer to fix.  It's a simple roast chicken with a stuffing of my own
  devising. The neat thing about it is that you put a nicely browned
  roast chicken on the table in front of admiring guests none of whom
  realize you've already had your meal++one better than they're about
  to partake of++though that one ain't bad either. First off, make the
  stuffing. Toast the oatmeal bread about medium brown. When it pops
  up, let it sit in the toaster for a few minutes to dry out. Chop the
  scallions into pieces about 1/4-to 1/2-inch long. Slice the button
  mushrooms or cut them into quarters if they're small. Chop the
  parsley roughly. Cut the dried toast into pices about 1/2 inch
  square. Put all these goodies into a large mixing bowl, add the eggs
  and mix well. Salt the stuffing to taste. Use pepper too if you like
  it. I sometimes also add Bell's Poultry Seasoning. At this point I
  reserve some of the stuffing++maybe a quarter or a third++and add the
  chopped giblets to it as I find that a lot of folks don't like them
  in the stuffing, hard as that may be to grasp.  But it works out good
  for me, as you'll see. After the chicken is washed and dried, stuff
  the critter with the stuffing from the non-gibletted bowl. Back when
  I developed this dish++when I didn't know how to cook++I took the
  word at it's face value and *stuffed* the stuffing into the body
  cavity. Since then I've heard that it's considered good form to stuff
  it loosely to allow for expansion. Don't listen to these lies. Stuff
  that sucker full! Heat the oven to between 350F and 400F. Rub the
  chicken with butter and salt it.  Put the stuffed chicken, breast
  side up, on a roasting rack in a pan of some sort with sides about an
  inch or so high++a big pyrex cake pan works well. I use one of those
  racks with the adjustable sides to hold the bird in place though
  anything will work except a vertical roaster. Now here's where the
  sly part comes in. Have a fork or a pair of chopsticks handy.  I
  recommend chopsticks if you can use them. You'll see why in a minute.
  Take the gibletted dressing and pack it all over the surface of the
  chicken, patting it into place. Put the neck where you can reach it
  to baste it. Dot the stuffing generously with pats of butter. (This
  ain't health food...) Put the bird into the oven and close the door.
  Don't look for about fifteen minutes or so. Chat. Entertain your
  guests. Pour them some more wine. After fifteen minutes you, as the
  cook, will be ready to begin one of the best meals of your life while
  your guests sit unsuspecting, waiting for the bird to be done. When
  the time has elapsed, start basting with a bulb baster. Do this
  regularly and religiously every five to ten minutes or so. Salt
  occasionally. The stuffing and giblets on top of the chicken will
  start to brown as you baste it with the flavor laden combo of butter
  and chicken juices. The toast bits will get crispy. The scallions
  will add their luscious juices to the basting liquid. The mushrooms
  will steam and beckon. Soon you'll be picking off the browner bits
  and savoring them. Each time you open the oven, a new selection of
  bits will be ready for your delectation! Try to look harried and
  pained so your guests won't know how much fun you're having. Give
  them some more wine to keep them quite. Have a little yourself. Maybe
  serve a salad or something... If any of them get suspicious, tell
  them you're "adjusting the seasonings".  That should throw them off
  the track enough that none of them will be tempted to "help" you with
  that arduous task. Heh, heh, heh... As you gradually clear the
  stuffing off the surface of the chicken the skin will begin to brown
  too. Keep basting! The chopsticks come in real handy now for
  retrieving the bits of mushrooms, giblets and whatever that fall down
  under the rack. They can get in where it's hard to get a fork. The
  dish is done when all the stuffing coating the outside of the bird is
  in your stomach and the skin has turned a nice, crispy, savory golden
  brown. Take the chicken out, put it on the serving platter and
  de-stuff it. Serve with rolls, salads, veggies, mashed taters and
  gravy (made of course, with instant mashed potatoes)++whatever your
  guests like or whatever strikes your fancy. You won't care. You'll
  already be full! I generally polish off a leg and a wing or so just
  for appearance's sake though. Oh yeah++and I always make the
  "sacrifice" and take the perfectly roasted, crispy skinned neck so my
  guest won't have to suffer through it...
  
  Two cautions.  One about the stuffing.  I love it, but it won't taste
  like traditional stuffings.  It will be redolent of mushrooms,
  parsley and scallions, very moist and++to my taste++quite nice. I
  really like the taste of oatmeal bread.  Using other bread, you'd
  probably have to spiff up the seasonings a bit.  The other caution
  is++do not use garlic! Heresy, I know, to some folks, but I tried it
  and it disrupted the nice balance of flavors. For folks who like
  crispy skin, all the basting produces an excellent skin++full of
  flavor and crispy. Good stuff++a meal in itself.

  bring to the boil. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
  the skins of the berries begin to pop. Do not overcook or the berries
  will be mushy. Remove from heat and stir in the orange zest. Transfer
  to a serving bowl and let cool. When room temperature, refrigerate

  When heat is no longer coming from the mass of candy...test it with
  your finger tips or wrist...when the dents made with your fingers
  remain for a little time instead of filling in immedietely & candy is
  luke warm, candy is ready to work. Work fondant with candy paddle
  until it sets up. Allow it to rest 15 minutes, covered. Then knead it
  until perfectly smooth. Like magic, the "crumbs will turn to
  wonderful creamy candy!

   This fondant is best if kept a day or so before using, but may be
  used I Hints:   For stiffer fondant, cook 1-2 degrees more. Freezing
  makes it sticky.

      Title: COOKED PUMPKIN
 Categories: Info, Kooknet
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
 
  Pumpkin is a winter squash that has been cultivated for hundreds of
  years in the Southwest.  It ranges in size from several inches to
  several feet and can be round or oblong in shape. The average cooking
  pumpkin is usually between 10 and 25 pounds.  The meat, the seeds,
  and the pumpkin's blossoms are all edible and can be prepared in many
  different ways. Pumpkin pulp is also sold in 16-ounce cans, which
  makes a convenient substitute for fresh cooked pumpkin in recipes.
  
  Fresh pumpkin, however, always tastes better.  Here is the method I
  use to cook it:  Cut the pumpkin into quarters and remove the seeds
  and fibers. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. and bake the pumpkin
  quarters 45 minutes, until tender.  Remove from the oven and scrape
  the flesh from the skin.  Place in a food processor and puree. Run
  through a sieve to remove any remaining fibers and use the pumpkin
  according to the recipe instructions.
  
  Cooked pumpkin will keep about 1 week in a nonmetal, covered
  container in the refrigerator and several months in the freezer.

  mass fluffy and easy to stir. Add more flour until a cookie dough
  texture is reached (I had to use ~ 2.75 c. total).
  
  Add chips or fruit or whatever.  Shape into balls and bake at 375
  until browned.  They do brown, they don't melt around the edges in
  that weird way that bad cookies do, and were considered entirely
  successful.

      Title: COOKIE ICE CREAM-A-ROUNDS
 Categories: Desserts, Cookies
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      1 pk Pills. Slice'n Bake cookies
      1 pk Vanill ice cream (1/2 gall.)
 
  Use Pillsbury Slice'n Bake Chocolate Chip cookies (large roll). Slice
  1 roll well-chilled Pillsbury Refrigerated Cookie Dough into 1/4"
  slices. Place 2" apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 9-12 min. or
  until golden brown.  Cool completely.  Use 2 cookies for each
  sandwich. Place 1 scoop ice cream on bottom of 1 cookie. Top with
  second cookie. Gently press together in center to spread ice cream to
  edge.  Serve immediately or wrap sandwich in foil and freeze.
   About 15 sandwichs. This is great with Chocolate chip cookies and
  vanilla ice cream but would probably be great with any Pillsbury
  cookie and any ice cream flavor you prefer.

      Title: COOKIE ORNAMENTS FOR THE TREE
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 3/4 c  Hot Water
      1 c  Salt
      4 c  All-Purpose Flour
           === Egg Wash ==
      1    Egg -- beaten with
      3 tb Water
 
  Pour the hot water into a bowl with the salt and stir for 1 minute (I
  use my KitchenAid mixer).  The salt grains will reduce in size, but
  they will not completely dissolve. Add the flour and blend until all
  the water is absorbed. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and
  knead a few minutes until it is smooth and pliable. Cover the dough
  and allow to rest for 5 minutes.  Keep the dough in a plastic bag if
  you do not plan to use it after the 5 minutes of resting time. Roll
  the dough out 3/8" thick on a floured surface and cut out shapes with
  cookie cutters. Place the cookies on a nonstick baking sheet and
  brush lightly with the egg wash. Bake in a preheated 300 degree oven
  for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until golden brown. You can also press
  the dough into lightly oiled fancy ceramic molds* or lightly floured
  wooden molds and bake as instruced by the manufacturer. *Decorative
  ceramic cookie molds can be obtained from Brown Bag Cookie Art by
  Hill Design, Inc. 7 Eagle Square, Concord, New Hampshire 03301 NOTES
  : No, Virginia, you cannot EAT these cookies. The dough is made of
  salt and flour and it will last for several years. This recipe makes
  one dozen ornaments.  The Frugal Gourmet

      4 c  Butter
      4 c  Hot sauce
      2 tb Cayenne
           Chicken wings
 
  To cut down the heat, use 1 Tb Ground Red pepper plus 1 Tb cayenne.
  Heat sauce as needed, for 10 minutes at 350, then dip wings into hot
  sauce mix. You can double the sauce recipe if you like. Use as much
  as you need to coat wings. It will keep indefinitely.  Just shake the
  jar and pour as much sauce as needed into a pan and reheat to dip
  chicken wings. The chef who gave me the recipe makes it a gallon at a
  time. He uses the cayenne-red pepper mix, I use all cayenne.

 Categories: Cookies, Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------TOTAL LEAD TIME: 35 MINUTES---------------------

MMMMM---------------------------INPUTS--------------------------------
      1 c  Brown sugar, packed
    1/2 c  Sugar, granualated
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
    1/2 c  Shortening
      2    Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
  2 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1 ts Soda, baking
    1/2 ts Salt
     12 oz Chocolate pieces, semi-sweet
      1 c  Pecans, chopped
 
  GUIDANCE:
  
  1.) After procurement actions, decontainerize inputs. Perform
  measurement tasks on a case-by-case basis.  In a mixing type bowl,
  impact heavily on brown sugar, granulated sugar, softened butter and
  shortening. Coordinate the interface of eggs and vanilla, avoiding an
  overrun scenario to the bes of your skills and abilities.
  
  2.) At this point in time, leverage flour, baking soda and salt into
  a bowl and aggregate.  Equalize with prior mixture and develop
  intense and continuous liaison among inputs until well-coordinated.
  Associate key chocolate and nut subsystems and execute stirring
  operations.
  
  3.) Within this time frame, take action to prepare the heating
  environment for throughput by manually setting the baking unit (by
  hand) to a temperature of 375 degrees =F8F (190 degrees C). Drop
  mixture in an ongoing fashion from a teaspoon type instrument in an
  ongoing fashion onto an ungreased cookie sheet at intervals
  sufficient enough apart to permit total and permanent separationof
  throughputs to the maximum extent practicable under operating
  conditions.
  
  4.) Position cookie sheet in bake situation and surveil for 8 to 10
  minutes or until cooking action terminates. Initiate coordination of
  outputs within the cooling rack function. Containerize, wrap in red
  tape and disseminate to authorized staff personnel on a timely and
  expeditious basis.
  
  OUTPUT: Six dozen official government chocolate chip cookie units.

      Title: COOKING ARTICHOKES
 Categories: Low fat, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  Choose nice firm artichokes that are not turning brown or looking
  dry. (I like to serve one artichoke per person.) Cut off the stems
  even with the bottom of the artichokes. Cut about an inch off of the
  top of the artichokes-straight across the tops of the leaves. Using a
  pot that's large enough to accomodate the chokes in a single layer,
  arrange artichokes in bottom of pot. Add water to a depth of 1 to 2
  inches. Bring water to a boil and turn down heat so that the water
  remains at a low simmer. Cover pot and cook for 45 minutes. Check
  occasionally to be sure the water is not boiling away, and add more
  if necessary.  The test for doneness is to pull out a leaf.  If it
  comes away from the artichoke easily, it's done. Serve on a plate
  with a small bowl of dipping sauce. To eat artichokes, pull off
  individual leaves, dip in sauce, and scrape leaf between teeth to
  remove the soft pulp near the bottom of the leaf. The remainder of
  the leaf is discarded.  As you get near the center, the leaves become
  tenderer and a greater portion of each leaf is edible. When you are
  near the center, remove any remaining leaves, and you'll see a fuzzy
  thing called a choke. This is not edible.  Scrape it off with a knife
  or spoon and discard. Under the choke is the heart which many think
  is the best part of an artichoke (though I kind of like the leaves
  better myself). The heart is completely edible.  Cut it up and dip
  the pieces in the sauce.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  Michele is right on target about salt making most beans tough. Keep
  in mind that the reverse is true - if you are trying to keep the more
  tender beans from disintegrating, add salt to the cooking water. I
  always cook dried lima beans in salted water. Several veg. cookbooks
  have excellent tips on handling beans and dealing with problems -
  Laurel's Kitchen and Lorna Sass' Cooking in an Ecological Kitchen (or
  maybe From an Ecological Kitchen, I can't remember) come to mind
  immediately.

      Title: COOKING BREADS & CAKES
 Categories: Crockpot
      Yield: 1 Lesson
 
MMMMM-------------------ITEMS THAT CAN BE USED------------------------
      2 lb Coffee can
      1 lb Coffee can
     16 oz Vegetable cans
      6 c  Mold, or 7 cups mold
  1 1/2 qt Baking dish
 
  There are a few tricks to remember when "baking" in one of these pots.
  First, turn the control to HIGH (or to the setting which is
  equivalent to the HIGH used in my recipes). The LOW setting is too
  low to give breads and cakes the texture you expect.  With breads,
  remember to cover the container with a lid or foil. Tie the lid or
  foil onto the container and place the container on a metal rack or
  trivet inside the pot. If you don't have a metal rack or trivet to
  fit your slow cooker, crumple foil and place it in the bottom of the
  pot to support the baking continer. Pour 2 cups of hot water around
  the container to provide steam for cooking the bread.
  
  When using a deep-dryer type slow cooker, check frequently to make
  sure the water hasn't evaporated. Add more water if needed.
  
  As a rule, it is not a good idea to remove the lid or foil from the
  bread container during the first 2 hours of cooking. After that,
  check the bread by inserting a toothpick in the mixture. If the
  toothpick comes out clean, the bread is done.
  
  When using a standard cake mix, the prcedure is slightly different.
  Cakes are "baked" in a pan set directly on the bottom of the slow
  cooker, similar to the way you would do it in an oven. It is not
  necessary to use a trivet or water.  Instead of covering the uncooked
  cake misture with foil or a lid, cover the top with four or five
  layers of paper towels. Becouse there is more moisture in a slow
  cooker than in an oven it is necessary to compensate for this with
  the paper towels to help absorb the moist top of the cake mix.  Also,
  leave the lid of your slow cooker slightly open to let extra moisture
  escape.
  
  The type and kind of container to use for breads and cakes will
  depend on the size of your pot.  In addition to molds and coffee
  cans, spring forms or small bundt pans make excellent containers.
  
  The containers at the top hold approzimately the same amount of
  batter so you can substitute one for another.

      Title: COOKING CORNED BEEF
 Categories: Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Wash under running water to remove surface brine.
  
  Cover with boiling water and simmer, allowing about 1 hour per pound,
  or until a fork can penetrate to center. Always slice corned beef
  very thin, diagonally across the grain.  A classic accompaniment of
  corned beef served hot is:
  
  Cabbage wedges simmered with the beef the last 15 minutes of cooking.
  Serve hot with: Horseradish Sauce Boiled Potatoes Gnocchi with Farina
  Serve corned beef cold with: Horseradish
  
  To press for slicing, cool the meat and force it into a deep pan;
  cover and refrigerate weighted.  The moisture pressed from the meat
  should form a jellied coating.
  
  After cooking corned beef as in 1, above, you may coat it with the
  following glaze and bake in a preheated 350F oven for 15 minutes or
  until the topping is set.
  
  Combine and mix well: 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 tablespoon water 1
  tablespoon soy sauce 2 teaspoons paprika 1/2 teaspoon ginger
  
  Tenderized corned beef can now be bought for oven roasting; follow
  manufacturer's directions.

      Title: COOKING DRY BEANS
 Categories: Digest, Oct., Text, Reference
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  This comes from Adele Davis' Let's Cook It Right:
  
  Soaking legumes is unnecessary if the dry legume is quickly washed and
  dropped into boiling water so slowly that boiling does not stop. As in
  popping corn, the starch grains burst and break the outside covering
  of the legume. After the covering and starch grains have burst, water
  is absorbed rapidly and the cooking time is shortened. When all the
  beans, lentils, or split peas have been put into the water, the heat
  should be lowered immediately to prevent the protein from becoming
  tough. A simmering temperature should then be maintained until the
  beans are tender.
  
  It works for me; I've found cooking times to be *significantly*
  reduced.

      Title: COOKING DUCK~ CHINESE STYLE
 Categories: Chinese, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 ea Duck
 
  HANDY CHINESE TRICKS FOR COOKING A WHOLE DUCK Cooking a duck can be
  intimidating to home cooks. Unlike chicken, there's a layer of fat
  that can cause problems. When duck is simply roasted, it often cooks
  unevenly, leaving a lot of excess fat. In addition, much of the
  potentially delicious skin is discarded. Chinese cooks slove these
  problems by applying two or more cooking methods to melt away most of
  the fat while enchancing the flavor of the meat. As a bonus, this
  technique can produce duck skin that is succulently crisp. For
  example, a duck may be seasoned and hung overnight in a cool, airy
  place, then steamed, perhaps smoked, and finally fried to a golden
  brown. Or, a duck may be browned over high heat in a wok full of oil
  (which melts away some of the fat), drained, and finally simmered in
  a wine/soy/rock sugar sauce, which is reduced at the end of the
  cooking time to a syrupy glaze. Sometimes just the skin is stuffed
  with boned duck meat, which has been mixed with glutinous rice or
  barley, mushrooms, Chinese dates, lotus seeds and ham; then the whole
  thing is steamed. The famous Peking Duck, which many rank as one of
  the world's greatest dishes, begins by easing the skin away from the
  meat then pumping in air so the whole duck inflats like a balloon.
  The duck then is scalded in a honey-vinegar mixture and hung
  overnight to dry before being cooked. This dish is not a good choice
  for the home cook because the duck is best roasted suspended in a
  special clay-lined oven. The lacquered-looking ducks that hang in
  Chinese delicatessens, somethimes mistakenly thought to be Peking
  ducks, actually are Cantonese roast ducks. After basting the skins
  and hanging the ducks overnight, they are roasted to golden brown
  perfection ~- a sauce of five-spices, star anise, wine and garlic
  simmering in their cavities. For not much more than the price of an
  uncooked duck, these, by the half or whole, make excellent take-out
  food. The method that follows for making Sichauan Crispy Skin Duck is
  typical of Chinese duck cookery. It requires a few steps over a
  couple of days, and two cooking procedures, but it's not difficult -
  although frying a whole duck in a wok full of oil may be a new
  experience.

      Title: COOKING GRAINS
 Categories: Grain veget, Info/tips
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        2    water
        1    grain
  
  The easiest way to cook grains is to rinse first in a colander under
  cold water until water runs clear. Then place in a fixed quantity of
  water (2 parts water for 1 part grain), bring to a rapid boil and
  lower heat to a simmer. Cover, simmer according to package directions
  and don't be tempted to stir. (Stirring makes a mushy end product.)
  This method is particularly well suited to softer grains, like
  quinoa. To speed cooking of hard grains like barley and wheat
  berries, soak several hours in cold water to cover. Then cook in a
  large open pot of boiling water, (see package directions). Then check
  out our recipes for some great grain-and-veggie combinations.

      Title: COOKING HINTS
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Information
 
  1.A slice of bread placed into a bag of hardened brown sugar will
  soften it again in a couple of hours. 2.Potatoes will bake in a hurry
  if they are boiled in salted water for 10 minutes before popping into
  a very hot oven. 3. A leftover baked potato can be re-baked if you
  dip it in water and bake in a 350 deg. F oven for 20 minutes. 4.A
  thin slice from each end of the potato will speed up baking time as
  well. 5.You'll shed less tears if you cut off the root end of the
  onion last. 6.No more tears when peeling onions if you place them in
  the freezer for 4 or
        5    minutes first. 7.Scalding tomatoes, peaches or pears in
  boiling water before peeling makes it easier on you and the fruit -
  skins slip right off. 8.Riper green fruits by placing them in a
  perforated plastic bag - the holes allow air movement, yet retain the
  odorless gas the fruits produce to promote ripening. 9.To hasten the
  ripening of garden tomatoes or avocados, put them in a brown paper
  bag, close the bag and leave at room temperature for a few days.
  10.When pan frying, heat the pan before adding butter or oil. 11.A
  little salt sprinkled into the frying pan will prevent spattering.
  12.Meat loaf will not stick if you place a slice of bacon on the
  bottom of the pan. 13.Vinegar brought to a boil in a new frying pan
  will prevent foods from sticking. 14.Muffins will slide right out of
  tin pans if you first place the hot pan on a wet towel. 15.Scalded
  milk will not stick to the pan if you first rinse the pan with cold
  water. 16.A cup of water added to the bottom portion of a broiler pan
  will absorb smoke and grease. 17.A few ts of sugar and cinnamon
  slowly burned on top of the stove will hide unpleasant cooking odors
  (and make folks think you've been baking all day!). 18.A lump of
  butter or a few ts of cooking oil added to water when boiling rice,
  noodles or spaghetti will prevent boiling over. 19.Rubbing the inside
  of the cooking vessel with vegetable oil will also prevent noodles,
  spaghetti and similar starches from boiling over. 20.A few drops of
  lemon juice added to simmering rice will keep the grains separate.
  21.Grating a stick of butter softens it quickly. 22.Soften butter for
  spreading by inverting a small heated pan over the butter dish for a
  while. 23.A dip of the spoon or cup into hot water before measuring
  shortening or butter will cause the fat to slip out easily without
  sticking to the spoon. 24.Before measuring honey or other syrup, oil
  the cup with cooking oil and rinse in hot water. 25.Catsup will flow
  evenly out of the bottle if you first insert a drinking straw to the
  bottom of the bottle and remove. 26.If you wet the dish on which the
  gelatin is to be unmolded, it can be moved around until centered.

           No ingredients
 
  One of the chief obstacles of most beginning wok cooks is knowing how
  to make good edible rice. There isn't any real secret to it. A recipe
  developed for beginners is included. All one has to do is follow the
  recipe instructions EXACTLY. But first, some facts on rice will be
  discussed.
  
  CHINESE RICE: There are many species of rice, about 1,000 of them.
  Approximately 50 of these types are cultivated in China. The
  properties of each of these varies as to growth, resistance to
  disease, adaptation to climate, soil conditions, etc. These factors
  all contribute to the quality of the harvested rice.
  
  Most Chinese and other Orientals can readily distinguish the quality
  of rice by its texture and taste after it is cooked. There are three
  main grain types of rice, long, medium or oval, and short. The
  Chinese people generally use long grain rice while the Japanese
  people favour oval grain rice. Short grain rice is generally cooked
  by both peoples for special pastries or festive dishes.
  
  Both long and oval grain rice are cooked in identical manners. The
  only difference is in knowing how much water is to be used in cooking
  the rice. This knowledge can only be obtained through experience and
  personal preference.

      Title: COOKING RICE ON THE STOVE
 Categories: Chinese, Rice, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  This is gonna seem so simple that you won't believe that it will
  work, but it does.  The thing with rice cooking is that folks tend to
  make it too hard.  Get out a nice heavy pan with a tight fitting lid.
  (Visions is nice for this cause you can see what's going on in the
  pot.) Get a bag of normal ol' long grain rice++not Rice-A-Roni or
  Uncle Ben's or any of that "converted" stuff.  Dump as much into the
  pot as you like (one cup dry makes about three cups cooked).
  
  At this point, you can either rinse it or not.  If you don't the rice
  will be a tad stickier when done. (That makes it good for eating with
  chopsticks.) If you rinse it well it will be a tad "fluffier".
  
  Personally, over the years I've come to NOT rinse my rice. It's just
  too much work and I can't really see that much difference in the
  finished product.
  
  Level the rice in the pot and place your index finger so that it just
  touches the surface of the rice.  Add water until the level comes
  just up to the crease at the backside of the top of the first knuckle
  on your index finger.  Crank the heat up on the stove quite high and
  put the pot of rice on the burner.  Stir the rice lightly before it
  comes to a boil, just once, so it doesn't stick. Let the shebang come
  to a full, rolling boil, then lower the heat to about medium. Let it
  boil, UNDISTURBED, until the free water evaporates and little holes
  appear in the surface of the rice.
  
  When this stage is reached, immediately lower the heat to the lowest
  setting possible (one of those "flame tamers" that you set on the
  burner can be helpful here), cover the rice and let it simmer and
  steam for about twenty minutes.  DO NOT LIFT THE LID UNTIL THE TIME
  HAS ELAPSED-DO NOT STIR THE RICE!!! Sorry++didn't mean to shout. ;-}
  When the time has passed you will have a pot of perfectly cooked
  rice. Fluff it a bit when you put it in the serving dish. No complex
  procedures, no measurements and very little fuss and muss...
  
  This is an old Chinese method of cooking rice and it works regardless
  of the amount of rice used.  Just remember the "first knuckle rule"
  and things should work well. I don't add salt to mine, but I don't
  imagine that it would cause any problems.  I've never cooked brown
  rice this way, but I imagine it would work if you doubled the
  steaming time. Another easy way to get perfect rice is to buy one of
  those Japanese rice cookers. They run around forty bucks and are
  really quite good at what they do. I'm using one made by Hitachi that
  works very well.

      Title: COOKING VANILLA
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Bottle Straight
           Bourbon Whisky -- (750 ml)
      4    Vanilla beans
 
  Slit open the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape the seeds out.
  Place the split beans into the bottle, along with the seeds that were
  scraped out. Shake well. The flavor will come out after about a month
  or two. Keep shaking and sniffing the bottle. As soon as it starts to
  smell sweet it's ready for cooking and baking. A great idea would be
  to make an additional bottle this year so it will be ready for all
  your holiday baking next year. Or, for a great gift to a fellow cook,
  poor some into a decorative bottle with an additional bean inside and
  wrap a ribbon around it. Remember, the longer the beans ferment in
  there, the stronger the vanilla flavor you will have.

 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Squash
        x  Apples
        x  Cranberries
        x  Water
 
  Cut open squash (cut in half or into chunks), scoop out seeds. Lay
  cut-side down in a baking pan.  Peel and core 1 or 2 apples; slice,
  and scatter the apple slices in with the squash. Scatter a handful or
  two of cranberries around with the squash and apples.  If you like
  your squash a bit moist, add a tablespoon or two of water to the
  bottom of the pan (I don't do this; my husband does).  Cover the pan
  with aluminum foil and bake at 400F for 1 hour, or until a fork stuck
  into the hard outside shell meets with no resistance.  Scoop the
  squash out of the rind, scoop up a bit of the apple and cranberries
  on the side, and enjoy!

      Title: COOKING WITH THE PRICKLY PEAR CACTUS
 Categories: Info, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  The prickly pear cactus plant grows wild throughout the southern
  region of Arizona where the air is warm and dry. It produces large,
  green, succulent pads that bear plump, juicy fruits in the late
  summer months.
  
  NOPALES
  
  Prickly pear pads (nopales) have been eaten by the Native Americans
  for centuries.  The pads are picked from the cactus but nust be
  handled with care; the hairlike spines that project from the pads can
  easily get caught in your skin.
  
  Cactus pads are found in most Mexican markets.  It is better to
  choose the smaller and thicker deep-green pads because they are the
  most tender. Usually fresh cactus pads ar esold whole. For
  convenience, however, they may also be purchased in jars already
  diced and even precooked in their natural juices.
  
  To clean the whole pads, hold them with a kitchen towel and remove the
  spines and rounded outside edge of the pads with a small paring knife
  or vegetable peeler.
  
  PRICKLY PEAR FRUITS
  
  Traditionally, prickly pear fruits are harvested in late summer. A
  brush made from wild grass is used to remove their fine, hairlike
  prickers and soft spines. To remove the prickers in a more
  conventional way, hold the fruit with metal tongs under cold running
  water and scrub the prickers off with a vegetable scrubbing brush.
  
  When selecting fruits from the marketplace, be careful to choose
  those that are soft but not overripe.  The may range in color from
  greenish-yellow to bright red, the latter being the ripest and best
  to eat. If the spines have not been removed, be careful when handling
  the fruits; the spines are small and difficult to remove from your
  hands. If only green fruits are available, store them at room
  temperature until they ripen to red.
  
  To extract the juice from the fruits, wash them thoroughly under cold
  running water, cut off the ends, and cut in half lengthwise. Place
  then in a food processor and puree to a fine pulp. Press the pulp
  through a fine sieve, using a wooden spoon or spatula to remove the
  seeds, which should be discarded.  Use the juice according to recipe
  instructions. Twelve prickly pears make approximately 1 cup ofjuice.

      Title: COOLING JARS
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  When you remove hot jars from a canner, do not retighten their jar
  lids. Retightening of hot lids may cut through the gasket and cause
  seal failures. Cool the jars at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours.
  Jars may be cooled on racks or towels to minimize heat damage to
  counters (Plate 1). The food level and liquid volume of raw-packed
  jars will be noticeably lower after cooling. Air is exhausted during
  processing and food shrinks. If a jar loses excessive liquid during
  processing, do not open it to add more liquid. Check for sealed lids.
  For more information see "Testing Jars Seals".

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Jim Vorheis
      3 tb Yellow corn meal
     12 oz Can Coors beer
      1 tb Butter
      1 tb Salt
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Honey
      2 c  Bread flour
  1 1/2 c  Rye flour
  1 1/2 ts Caraway seeds
    1/4 c  Bread flour
           Filling:
    1/2 c  Thousand Island dressing
     16 oz Sauerkraut, drained
    1/2 lb Corned beef, thinly sliced
    1/2 lb Swiss cheese, thinly sliced
 
  IN medium saucepan, combine corn meal and beer.  Heat to boiling and
  simmer for 2 minutes.  Stir in butter and salt. Cool to 105-115 F.
  Stir in yeast, sugar and honey and let stand for 5 minutes. Pour
  mixture into large mixing bowl and add 2 cups of bread flour,
  stirring until well blended. Add rye flour and caraway seeds and mix
  thoroughly. Place dough on a lightly floured board and work in enough
  of remaining 1/4 cup bread flour to reduce stickiness and make dough
  workable. Place dough in oiled bowl and turn to coat all sides. Let
  rise until doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch dough down and let rest for 10 minutes.  Divide dough in half,
  covering one piece.  On a floured surface, roll other piece into
  rectangle not longer than baking sheet. Trim dough so that rectangle
  is a true shape. Lightly score dough into thirds lengthwise. Spread
  1/2 dressing over the center third, leaving 1 inch at top and bottom
  of section uncovered. Cover dressing with 1/2 sauerkraut, 1/2 corned
  beef and 1/2 cheese. Fold 1 inch at top and bottom over filling and
  pinch to seal. On each side of filling, make cuts at 1-inch
  intervals. Cuts begin 1/2 inch from filling and go to outer edges.
  Beginning on right, pull top strip across middle and seal end on
  other side of filling. Pull top left strip across middle and seal;
  alternate in braiding fashion until all strips are secured. Repeat
  with other ball of dough. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes. Place on
  greased baking sheet and bake at 350 F for 30 minutes. Slice to serve.

    1/4 ts Ground white pepper
    1/4 ts Dried thyme leaves, crushed
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
      1 pk (8oz) frozen sugar snap peas
 
  In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add chicken
  pieces skin side down and brown well. Using tongs, turn chicken
  pieces to brown on all sides. Transfer chicken pieces to a large
  baking dish. Set aside.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F. To drippings that remain in skillet, add onions,
  carrots and garlic. Saute over medium-high heat until onions and
  carrots are lightly browned.
  
  Add brandy to skillet. Holding skillet with a pot holder, carefully
  but quickly ignite the brandy. Shake skillet gently until the flames
  subside. Add wine, parsley, bay leaf, salt, pepper, thyme and ground
  cloves.
  
  Increase heat to high and bring the carrot mixture to boiling,
  stirring frequently. Remove skillet from heat. Using a large spoon,
  transfer the carrot mixture to the chicken in the baking dish.
  
  Cover baking dish with lid or aluminum foil. Place on center rack of
  oven and bake 30 minutes. Uncover dish and distribute sugar snap peas
  evenly over the chicken and carrot mixture.
  
  Cover baking dish and bake 30 minutes longer or until juices run
  clear when chicken is pierced with a fork and vegetables are tender.
  Remove bay leaf. Transfer to a decorative serving platter.
  
  RED WINE VARIATION: To make a more classic version of this chicken
  dish, substitute a hearty red wine, such as Burgundy, Beaujolais or
  Chianti, for the white wine. Add 1/21b tiny white mushrooms to the
  skillet when the carrots are added and stir 1/2 tablespoon tomato
  paste into the carrot mixture just before the chicken goes into the
  oven.

  sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
  thyme.  Leave the string long enough to hang the garni in the pot and
  tie the string to the pot handle for easy removal. In a large

  Season with salt and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Add the
  scallops. Cover the saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove the
  pan from the heat. Drain the scallops and keep them warm. In a bowl
  beat the mustards, tomato paste and lemon juice into a smooth paste.
  Add the egg yolks to the mustard mixture and beat until it is light
  and creamy. Melt the butter in the top part of the double boiler over
  hot water. The butter should be warm, NOT hot. Keep the water
  simmering and slowly whisk the yolk mixture into the melted butter.
  The sauce should get thick and creamy. Be sure not to let it come to
  a boil or the yolks will curdle.  Remove the sauce from the heat.
  Season it with salt and pepper.  Add the parsley, capers and finally
  the warm well-drained scallops.  Serve immediately, garnished with
  chives and lemon quarters. Note:  In certain regions of France this
  course is served surrounded by boiled potato balls and buttered

      Title: COQUILLES SAINT-JACQUES SAUTEES A LA PROVENCA
 Categories: Italian, Shellfish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Or about 2 c. scallops
           Cut into 1/2 inch pieces
           Lemon juice, salt, and
           Pepper
    1/2 c  Flour
           Olive oil or cooking oil
           A 10 inch frying pan
           (preferably a no-stick
           Pan)
      2 tb Minced shallots or
           Scallions
      1    Clove garlic, mashed
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Minced fresh parsley
 
  Dry the scallops in paper towels, then place on a large sheet of waxed
  paper.  Sprinkle with drops of lemon juice, then with salt and
  pepper. The moment before sauteing, dredge with flour and shake in a
  sieve to dislodge excess flour. Film the frying pan with a 1/16-inch
  layer of oil. When almost smoking, add the scallops. Toss for 4 to 5
  minutes until scallops are lightly browned.  Then toss for a moment
  with the shallots or scallions, and garlic; finally toss with the
  butter and parsley and serve. Suggested accompaniments: If the
  scallops are a first course, accompany with French bread. For a main
  course, accompany with broiled tomatoes and green beans. Notes:
  Sauteed scallops should be crisp light brown outside and moistly
  tender inside. Keys to success are: have your sauteing oil very hot
  before the scallops go in, and have no more than one layer of
  scallops in the pan.  Otherwise the scallops will steam, exude
  moisture, and will not brown. You may find, in using frozen scallops,
  that they will start out nicely, then suddenly release juices in the
  pan; to avoid this, blanch them before cooking by dropping them in a
  large pan of rapidly boiling water and bringing them quickly back to
  the boil, then drain immediately, dry them, and proceed with the
  recipe.

      8 oz Monterey jack cheese, grated
    1/2 c  Whole kernel corn
      2 ts Dried basil
      1 ts Dried oregano
           Pepper

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE BATTER----------------------------
      6 lg Eggs, separated

  bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold the egg yolks along with the
  flour, baking soda, and salt into tht egg whites. Place additional
  flour in a flat dish.
  
  7. Roll each chile in flour to coat. Working in batches, dip each

  In a large serving bowl, toss together all the ingredients & serve.
  
  MARK'S NOTE:  An easy way to grill corn.  Soak the unhusked corn in
  water for 20 minutes.  If using a grill, place the ears in the coals
  right at the edge of your barbecue. Turn very often. They should be
  done after 20 minutes, maybe a little less.  Or, bake in a 350F oven
  for the same length of time.  This is my favourite way to cook corn,
  it doesn't taste waterlogged using this method.

      Title: CORN & POTATO CHOWDER
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Coarsely chopped onions
           (preferably red)
      4 c  Boiling veg. stock (or
           More)
      1 lb Thin-skinned potatoes,
           Peeled and cut into 1/2"
           Dice
      1 lg Red bell pepper, seeded and
           Diced
      4 c  Fresh or frozen (defrosted)
           Corn kernels
      2 ts Fresh or 1/2 t dried thyme
 
  Heat some stock in the cooker.  Cook the onions over medium-high heat,
  stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add the rest of the stock,
  potatoes, red bell pepper, 1 C of corn, and thyme. (She notes here
  that if you are using fresh corn, add the cobs too for more
  sweetness.)
  
  Lock the lid in place.  Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Lower
  the heat just enough to maintain high pressure ad cook for 4 minutes.
  (!!! I was impressed !!!) Reduce the pressure with a quick-release
  method. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess
  steam to escape.
  
  Remove the corn cobs (if used).  With a slotted spoon, put about 2 C
  cooked veggies into a food processor and puree them w/2 more C of the
  corn. (I just dumped the 2C corn into the cooker and used one of
  those hand-held blenders right in there to puree things together
  until it looked nice.) Stir the puree back into the soup together
  with the remaining C of uncooked corn.  Add salt and pepper and
  simmer until the just-added corn is tender, 2-3 minutes.

      Title: CORN & SAUSAGE CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Polish sausage,
           -sliced thinly
      6 sl Bacon, chopped
      1 c  Onions, chopped
    1/4 c  Flour
      2 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Water
      4 c  Corn
      2 c  Potatoes, cubed
           -(about 1/4")
    1/8 ts White pepper
           Red pepper sauce
      2 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter
 
  In a big saucepan, brown the sausage and bacon until bacon is crispy.
  Remove sausage and bacon with a slotted spoon, and drain on a paper
  towel. Discard most of the fat; leave enough to cook the onion. Saute
  onion in reserved fat until tender, about 5 minutes.
  
  Gradually stir in the flour.  Add stock and water, stirring
  constantly. Add sausage, bacon, corn, potatoes and white pepper. Add
  red pepper sauce to taste.  Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer,
  covered, for 15 to 20 minutes.  Stir occasionally.
  
  Add milk and cook until soup is heated through and potatoes are
  tender. Top with butter and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich creamy chowder with corn and sausages -- This chowder is a
  variation on a family recipe from an old roommate of mine. (She makes
  it without the sausage, and with more water). It goes very well with
  most seafood.  I am especially fond of it served with crab cakes.
  Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CORN & WHEAT TORTILLAS
 Categories: Flatbreads, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Stone ground corn meal
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 c  Boiling water
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Pour the boiling water over the corn meal. Let sit ten minutes or
  more. Mix salt and whole wheat flour. Add enough flour to the corn
  meal mixture to make a kneadable dough. Knead 5 to 10 minutes. Let
  sit 5 minutes. Pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a
  golfball. Roll out on a floured board to a more or less round shape
  about 4 inches in diameter. Cook on an unoiled hot griddle or heavy
  skillet, about 2 minutes on each side. You can salt the griddle to
  keep the tortillas from sticking, but it is not really necessary. I
  also like these cut into wedge shapes and deep fried in very hot
  oil(corn chips) and served with guacamole, hot salsa or refried beans
  and cheese(or all of the above). From The Deaf Smith Country

      Title: CORN BEAN & PUMPKIN STEW
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Pinto beans, soaked
           Overnight and drained
        x  Salt
      1 lb Tomatoes, fresh or canned,
           Peeled, seeded, and chipped,
           Juice
           Reserved [peeled and seeded?
           Yea, right.]
      3    Ears corn (about 1 1/2 C
           Kernels)
      1 ts Cumin seeds
      1 ts Oregano
      1    Inch piece of cinnamon
      3    Cloves
      1 lg Onion, cut into a medium
           Dice
      2    Cloves garlic, finely
           Chopped
      1 tb Paprika
      2 c  Bean broth or stock [if you
           Make the stock yourself, she
           Suggests
           One made with carrots,
           Zucchini, onion, potato,
           Parsley, garlic,
           Cinnamon, cloves, coriander
           Seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom
           Pods, and
           Salt ]
      3 c  Pumpkin or winter squash,
           Peeled and cut into 1 inch
           Cubes
      2    Serrano chilies, seeded and
           Finely chopped [or to make
           It hotter
           Without adding chili powder,
           Leave in the seeds]
        x  Cilantro or parsley,
           Chopped, for garnish
 
  Cook the beans in water and 1/2 t salt for about 1.5 hrs or until
  beans are tender.  Drain and reserve the cooking liquid.
  
  Warm a small heavy skillet and toast the cumin seeds until their
  fragrance emerges; then add the oregano, stir for 5 seconds, and
  quickly transfer the spices to a plate or bowl so they don't burn.
  Combine them with the cinnamon and the cloves, and grind to a powder
  in an electric spice mill.
  
  Heat a wide skilled [with water or some sauteing liquid] and saute the
  onion briskly over high heat for 1 minute; then lower the heat to
  medium. Add the garlic, the spices, the paprika, and 1 t salt. Stir
  well to combine; then add 1/2 C reserved bean broth or stock and
  cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft. Next add the
  tomatoes and cook 5 minutes. Then add the pumpkin or winter squash
  along with another C of bean broth or stock.  After 20 to 30 minutes,
  or when the pumpkin is about half-cooked -- soft but still too firm
  to eat -- add the corn, the beans, and the fresh chilies.  Thin with
  the reserved tomato juice, adding more broth or stock as necessary.
  Cook until the pumpkin is tender. Check the seasoning, and add more
  salt if necessary. Serve garnished with the chopped cilantro or
  parsley.
  
  Even though there is corn in the stew, corn bread or tortillas make a
  good accompaniment.
  
  Well, the book is actually Greens, not Savory Way, but here's the
  adapted recipe (p. 218 for those of you that have it on your shelf).

      Title: CORN BISCUITS
 Categories: Breads--qui, Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Butter, softened -- at room
           Temperature
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Yellow cornmeal
      2    Eggs at room temperature
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour (approx)
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  Stir the butter into a soft
  mass; slowly add sugar, blending together well. Add cornmeal, eggs,
  and salt. Beat until the mixture is smooth; add 1-1/4 c. flour (the
  mixture will be soft and moist).  Roll the dough out to 1/4"
  thickness; if the dough is too sticky to roll, add 1/4 c. flour and
  blend into the top of the dough with your hands (I find it's also
  easier if you roll out on a lightly floured board).  Cut out 4 dozen
  1-1/2" rounds with a cookie cutter (I've also used squares, etc. --
  whatever cutters I had handy at the time). Place close together on a
  lightly greased baking sheet, but don't let them touch. Bake on
  center shelf for about 22 minutes or until biscuits are just starting
  to turn slightly brown around the edges. Near the end of this baking
  period turn the baking sheet around for even cooking. If the biscuits
  near the outer edges of the sheet are browning too fast then just
  remove them if they're done or rearrange the biscuits on the sheet so
  the brown-er ones get moved to the center. Remove biscuits from the
  oven and cool on a rack. These are wonderful served warm; they freeze
  very well and can be warmed up when ready to serve.
  
  If not freezing them, keep at room temperature in an airtight
  container. Kept this way the biscuits will last up to 10-14 days.
  
  These biscuits are terrific served with coffee or tea, or with a dish
  of fresh fruit.  They are slightly sweet with a wonderful, grainy
  texture due to the cornmeal in the recipe. They're quite addictive.
  
  (makes 4 dozen, but they don't last long!)

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
      8 oz Grated Cheddar Cheese
 
  Grease a 2 pound loaf tin and heat the oven to gas mark 5,375F,190C.
  Place the flour, corn meal, sugar and baking powder into a bowl, and
  beat in the eggs, milk, oil and yoghurt. Mix all the liquids together
  first if you like, then pour them in. Give the mixture a good stir.
  At this point you could add 8 ounces of grated Cheddar Cheese or
  similar. Pour into the tin and bake for 55 minutes. Test with a
  skewer - if it comes out clean it's ready, if it's a bit smeary it
  needs another 5 to 10 minutes, but cover the top with foil to stop
  the crust burning. Remove when ready and let it stand for five
  minutes before turning out. You may find a knife round the edge helps

    1/3 c  Vegetable Oil
 
  Corn Bread from Scratch 2 to 3 hours
  
  Corn bread mix is so successful you really don't need to make it from
  scratch, but it costs more than a hand-mixed version. I grease the
  mold for corn bread with bacon drippings.
  
  To Cook: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cornmeal, sugar,
  baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center. Turn the egg,
  milk, and melted butter or oil into the well and beat into the dry
  mixture until just moistened. Turn into a greased 2-quart mold, cover
  with a plate, and place on a trivet or rack in the bottom of the slow
  cooker. Cover the cooker, cook on high for 2 to 3 hours. Makes 6
  servings.

      Title: CORN BREAD II
 Categories: Breads, Cajun
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Corn meal
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Soda
      2 c  Buttermilk
    2/3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      2    Eggs, beaten
 
     Prepare large cast iron skillet:  grease generously with bacon
  drippings so that bottom of skillet is well covered. Place skillet in
  400 F. oven to heat. Meanwhile prepare batter: Combine dry
  ingredients, add eggs and butter milk, mixing well.  Remove skillet
  from oven when grease starts to smoke; scrape batter into skillet.
  Batter must start to sizzle as soon as it hits skillet.  Place in
  oven and continue baking for 20-25 minutes, or until browned on top.
  I don't use this skillet for anything but corn bread and I never wash
  it, just wipe out well. After a few times you will find the corn
  bread will fall out of pan easily and intact. Courtesy Telephone

      Title: CORN CHILI
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        4    plump ears of corn
        5    Ancho chilies, -- stems
  :          removed, seeded
        2 ts ground cumin
        1 ts ground coriander
        1 ts ground Mexican oregano
        2 TB corn oil
        1 lg onion,  finely diced
        4    garlic clove  minced
       12 oz bottle Mexican beer
      3/4 c  chicken stock
  :          Salt
  :          Lime juice
  
  Cut kernels from corn cobs and set aside; you should have 2 cups of
  whole kernels. With the back of a knife, scrape down cobs to remove
  liquid and pulp. Reserve in a small bowl; you should have a 1/2 cup
  of corn puree.
  
  Soak chilies in hot water to cover until soft. Drain, reserving
  soaking liquid. In a blender combine chilies, cumin, coriander,
  oregano and tortillas. Blend, adding just enough reserved chile
  liquid to make a thick paste. Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high
  heat. Pour in chile paste and fry for about 3 minutes, or until it
  thickens. Add onion, garlic and corn kernels and fry 2 minutes more.
  Add corn puree, beer and chicken stock. Bring to a boil, and simmer

      Title: CORN CHIPS
 Categories: Breads, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Warm (100 F.) water
      1    Egg yolk
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Masa harina, or as needed
           Corn oil for frying
 
  In a mixing bowl, whisk the water, egg yolk and salt together until
  thoroughly mixed. Gradually add enough masa to make a soft dough, just
  stiff enough not to stick to your fingers.
  
  In a heavy skillet, deep fryer, or elec. skillet preheat oil to at
  least 375 F.
  
  Fit a cookie press or pastry bag with the plate or tip designed to
  make a flat, ribbed shape and fill it with the masa dough. Press out
  into the hot oil a few short lengths of dough, enough to cover only
  about half the surface of the oil.  Fry ribbons turning once, just
  until golden brown. Remove with slotted spoon or skimmer and drain on
  paper towels.
  
  Serve chips while still warm, or cool completely and store airtight.
  To serve chips after storage, freshen briefly in warm oven. Will keep
  for up to one week.
  
  Masa flour, made from specially processed corn, has a taste all its
  own. Cornmeal CANNOT be substituted. Chips can be made in double or
  triple batches and are so quick they can be made on very short notice.

      Title: CORN CREPES
 Categories: Pancakes
      Yield: 18 Crepes
 
      3 lg Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Water
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Masa harina (corn flour)
      3 tb Butter; melted (plus more)
 
  Beat the eggs, milk, water and salt together, then beat in the white
  flour, the masa harina, and the melted butter. Or combine all the
  ingredients in a blender and blend until perfectly smooth, stopping
  to scrape down the sides as needed. Let the batter rest for at least
  an hour.
  
  Heat a crepe pan and brush it with butter, then pour in just enogh
  batter to cover the bottom of the pan by quickly tilting it around--a
  scant 1/4 cup. Cook for a minute or two on medium heat, until the
  crepe is golden brown on the bottom, then gently peel it up and flip
  it over. Cook the other side until golden and spotted with brown,
  usually less than a minute. Continue this way until all the batter is
  used.
  
  Stack the crepes and keep them covered with a slightly damp kitchen
  towel as you work. The crepes can be made several hours or a day
  ahead and kept in the refrigerator, tightly covered with plastic
  wrap. If you refrigerate crepes, allow them to return to room
  temperature before filling or rolling them. If handling crepes that
  are still cold, heat a non-stick pan and place each crepe in it for a
  few seconds to warm it up before filling it; this softens the crepe
  and keeps it from cracking.
  
  Makes about 18 to 20 crepes.

 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Goat cheese, fresh, white
      3    Eggs
  1 2/3 c  Corn kernels, fresh
  1 2/3 c  Nopalitos; diced/cooked *
    1/2 c  Golden raisins
    1/2 c  Pine nuts; lightly toasted
      2 tb Green chilis; diced
           Salt to taste
           Melted butter

MMMMM------------------------TO ASSEMBLE-----------------------------
     18    Corn crepes
      1 qt Mole Poblano Sauce; approx

MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
           Sour cream
           Cilantro sprigs
 
  * if nopalitos can't be found, use diced small zucchini, lightly
  sauteed in a little butter and a drop of lemon juice
  
  Soften the goat cheese with a fork. Lightly beat the eggs and stir
  them thoroughly into the cheese.
  
  Scald the corn kernels for about a minute, then drain them completely.
  
  Stir together the cheese mixture, the corn kernels, and all the
  remaining ingredients except the melted butter. Taste, and add salt
  only if it is really needed.
  
  To assemble and serve the crepes: Lightly butter a large baking
  sheet. Take one pliable crepe at a time and mound 2 rounded
  tablespoons of filling down the center of it, leaving plenty of room
  all around. Roll the crepe over the filling, folding in the sides
  envelope-style as you finish rolling it up. Fill and fold all the
  crepes this way. Arrange the crepes, seam side down, close together
  on the prepared baking sheet. Brush their tops lightly with melted
  butter. Bake the crepes for about 25 minutes at 350 degrees--they
  will be slightly puffed and golden brown.
  
  Meanwhile, heat the mole to a simmer. Spoon about 1/2 cup of mole
  onto each plate, place one or two of the hot stuffed crepes on top of
  the mole, and garnish with a little dollop of sour cream and a few
  cilantro sprigs. Serve at once.
  
  Serve 8-10 as a main course, 18-20 as little dish in a series of
  courses.

      Title: CORN MUFFINS (SAMUEL)
 Categories: Breads, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Corn flour or cornmeal
           - (yellow or blue)
      1 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
      6 oz Soft tofu
      3 c  Water
    1/2 ts Salt (sea salt in book)
 
  Mix flours. Crumble tofu into blender.  Add boiled water and salt to
  tofu in blender (carefully) and blend until not quite smooth. (Just a
  few pulses please). Dont do this in too small blender or without lid
  like I did once. The goal is muffins, not 2nd degree burns. Add
  immediately to flour and mix well. Spoon into muffin tins or cast
  iron stick trays and bake at 400 degrees for about 1/2 hour until
  golden brown. She suggests you heat oven first and place oiled muffin
  tins in to heat up beforehand to get a "wonderful crust".
  
  Please note, I have to oil the tins because I don't use teflon
  products around by birds, but this might work also.....This is not
  sweet bread, I serve corn potato chowder with it. The corn sticks are
  better!

  Bulgur wheat is readily available in most supermarkets and specialty
  food stores. If you prefer another grain, you can easily substitute
  cooked rice, barley or couscous. When mixing the salad, use a fork to
  keep grains from sticking together.
  
  1. Combine the bulgur, garlic, water and olive oil in a large bowl.
  Mix together, then set aside for 30 minutes.

      Title: CORN TORTILLAS (AHA)
 Categories: Breads, Mexican, Heartright
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 tb Acceptable margarine
      1 c  Stone-ground cornmeal
  1 1/2 tb Acceptable margarine
  1 1/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
      1 ts Salt
 
  Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan.  Add 1 1/2 T margarine.
  Stir in cornmeal quickly, then immediately lower heat and cover pan.
  Let cornmeal cook over very low heat for 5 minutes.  Stir in
  remaining margarine and set aside to cool.
  
  Mix flour and salt.  Stir in cooled cornmeal and knead, adding water
  or more flour if necessary to form a soft dough.  Pinch off twelve
  pices and roll into 2-inch balls.
  
  Flatten each ball between palms or against a board, making a flat
  circle. Roll with rolling pin to 6-7 inches.  Keep turning the circle
  to keep it round, and sprinkle board and pin with cornmeal as needed
  to prevent sticking.
  
  Cook on a hot ungreased griddle for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or
  until flecked with dark spots.
  
  Line a basket or bowl with a large cloth.  Stack tortillas in bowl
  and keep covered with cloth.
  
  They may be made up to a day in advance.  Heating for a few seconds
  on each side makes them soft and pliable for handling again.  Heat
  them on a griddle or directly over a medium gas flame.

      Title: CORN TORTILLAS (MAKING)
 Categories: Breads, World
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------FOR 16 TORTILLAS---------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Masa harina
    1/2 c  Cornmeal
  1 1/2 tb Oil
  1 1/3 c  Warm water
 
  Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl and beat with a
  wooden spoon until thick and smooth. Scrape the sides of the bowl,
  and cover the surface of the dough with plastic wrap while pressing
  and frying individual tortillas so the dough will not dry out. To
  form the tortillas, wet your hands and pull off a lump of dough about
  the size of a golfball. Roll it into a ball. Tear off 2 pieces of
  plastic wrap about a foot long. Either in a tortilla press, or
  between 2 dinner plates, place the ball between the sheets of plastic
  wrap. Press down with the palm of your hand to flatten slightly, then
  press firmly to form a thin circle. Use the first tortilla to test
  the consistency of the dough. If the edges of the tortilla are uneven
  and crumbly, the dough needs a little more water. If the sheet of
  plastic sticks to the dough and it is very soft, add a few
  tablespoons of masa harina. Repeat with the remaining dough, leaving
  individual tortillas between the sheets of plastic wrap. Heat a heavy
  skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Peel off the top sheet of
  plastic and invert the tortilla into the hot pan. Grill until
  stiffened, about 30 seconds; turn for 1 minute or less, until the
  side is slightly browned, then turn to the first side for 30 seconds.
  The time for grilling each tortilla is less than 2 minutes. Repeat
  with the remaining tortillas. Source: SouthWest Tastes

      Title: CORN TORTILLAS - ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Mexican, Tortilla
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        c  Quaker Oats Masa Harina mix
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Salt
 
  Add salt to dry Masa Harina. (Quaker Oats Masa Harina mix (corn and
  lime), is available in many supermarkets.) Mix masa with 1 1/3 to 1
  1/2 C warm water. Mix in well and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Form
  into golf ball sized balls.
  
  Heat up a cast iron griddle over low-med heat, ungreased.
  
  Put each ball of Masa between two pieces of wax paper and press down
  flat with a flat-bottomed pan or bowl (or tortilla press if you want
  to spend the money). You won't get it as thin as store bought
  tortillas, but you want them a little thick. They taste better that
  way! Pull off the wax paper off one side. Flip tortilla onto the
  curled fingers of your other hand (so that remaining wax paper is now
  face up), then very carefully peel off other wax paper. This might
  take some practice. If one corner doesn't work, start at the other.
  (If dough repeatedly sticks, you've used too much water. If dough
  repeatedly falls apart, you haven't used enough water.)
  
  Cook each tortilla on the griddle, first on one side , then the other.
  Don't let them get crispy.
  
  To make Enchiladas:
  
  The above, plus some finely chopped onion, some grated cheese (Use
  Monterey Jack)
  
  Most recipes say you first fry the tortillas for a few seconds in hot
  oil then drain before going on to the next step. You can skip this
  step without much loss in flavor if you use home-made tortillas.
  Experiment. Dip a tortilla in enchilada sauce. Put it down in a
  lasagna pan. Sprinkle grated cheese and onion on it. Put another
  tortilla that has been dipped in sauce over the top and repeat to two
  or three layers thick.
  
  At the end pour remaining sauce over top with remaining cheese and
  onions.
  
  Bake at 350 degrees for about twenty minutes.

 Categories: Mexican, Breads
      Yield: 12 Tortillas
 
  1 1/2 c  Masa harina *
      2 ts Salt
      2 ts Vegetable shortening
  1 1/4 c  Water
 
  * Masa harina -    A flour made from dried corn, which is combined
  with liquid and used to make corn tortillas and tamales. Masa harina
  is available in many grocery stores and may be stored in an airtight
  containers or in a freezer. In a medium bowl, stir together the masa
  harina and salt.  In a small saucepan over high heat, bring the lard
  of shortening and water to a boil and stir until melted.  Pour this
  liquid into the masa harina and blend well with a fork or pastry
  blender. Knead on a lightly floured board until smooth, about 5
  minutes.
  
  Divide the dough into 12 pieces and roll each into a ball about 1
  inch in diameter.  Roll out the dough between pieces of parchment or
  waxed paper until the dough is paper thin and about 6 inches in
  diameter.
  
  Heat a large cast iron or other heavy skillet over high heat until
  very hot.  Remove a circle of dough from the paper and place it in
  the hot skillet.  Cook until brown on one side, about 30 seconds,
  turn and brown the other side.  Keep warm in a cloth towel. Repeat
  until all the tortillas are made.
  
  TORTILLA CHIPS
  
  Cut tortilla into 8 wedges; set aside.  Pour oil into a heavy
  saucepan or skillet to a depth of 1 inch Over medium high heat, heat
  to a temperature of 375 degrees F, or until a tortilla chips browns
  in 60 seconds.
  
  Drop the tortilla wedges into the hot oil in batches and cook for 1
  to 2 minutes, or until they turn golden. Drain on paper towels. Let
  cool and store in airtight containers.

  Meanwhile, return the sauce to the pan, bring back to a boil, add
  sherry & simmer for a couple of minutes. Pour over cobs & serve.

      Title: CORN-MILLET CIRCLES
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      1 c  Corn flour
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Whole millet
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  "Corn flour provides an extra special sweetness for these crackers.
  Millet gives them their incomparable texture. Corn-Millet Circles are
  great with sharp Cheddar cheese or a rich pate. 325~F. 25 to 30
  minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  Mix the flours, millet, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl or
  in the food processor. Cut in the shortening until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal. Slowly blend in enough of the milk to form a
  dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8-inch thickness.
  
  Using a 2-inch round cookie-cutter or the rim of a small glass, cut
  out circular crackers. Place them on an ungreased baking sheet. Prick
  each in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned, turning the
  crackers over half-way through. Cool on a rack. Yield: 40-50.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  White flour
      1 c  Corn flour or fine cornmeal
      2 tb Sugar
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Milk
      2 tb Melted butter
 
  This batter can also be baked in muffin cups as well as in a loaf pan.
  Either way, it's good.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Combine the white flour, corn flour or cornmeal,
  sugar, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs;
  then stir in the milk and the butter. Pour the wet ingredients into
  the dry ones and stir just enough to combine, in about 15-or-16
  strokes. Overmixing causes the cornbread to be tough. Pour into a
  buttered baking pan and bake until the cornbread is firm and a
  toothpick comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

      Title: CORNBREAD <T>
 Categories: Digest, August, Ovo lacto
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Cornmeal
    1/2 c  Flour (I use unbleached)
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Applesauce
    3/4 c  Skim milk
      2    Egg whites
 
  This is plain cornbread, not a corn flavored cake, so don't expect it
  to be fluffy or sweet. It's great with black-eyed peas, new potatoes,
  green onions, sliced tomatoes, and buttermilk, i.e., your basic
  Southern farm fare. It's also very nice cold, broken into bite-sized
  pieces in a glass of cold milk and eaten with a spoon.
  
  Preheat oven to 425F. Grease pan (I use our #5 cast iron skillet - 8"
  dia.) with a dab of olive oil on a paper towel (or spray with Pam)
  and put in oven to preheat. Mix all ingredients, pour batter in
  heated pan, and bake for 20 min. Cut into six medium or eight small
  pieces.

      4 c  Dry cornbread crumbs
           (from your favorite NON-
           SWEET cornbread recipe)
      4 c  Dry white bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
      2    Onions, chopped
      6    Ribs celery (including
           -some tops), chopped
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans or walnuts
      1 cn Corn, undrained, OPTIONAL

           -to moisten
           Sage, thyme, salt and
           -pepper to taste
 
  As a Californian, married into a Southern family, I can warn you that
  the traditional cornbread stuffing probably isn't gonna be to his
  taste. The first time I had the stuff, I found it gritty, nasty, and
  just plain wierd.
  
  Wes, on the other hand, was less than enthralled by the sage-laden
  stuff that *I* think ought to go into a bird. Now, we compromise,
  with a dressing that we both enjoy.
  
  Crumble the cornbread and white bread into a big bowl.
  
  Melt the butter in a large frying pan, add the onions and celery, and
  cook over low heat until the vegetables are soft, but not browned.
  Dump the butter/vegetable mixture over the bread.  Stir in the nuts,
  canned corn and its liquid (if used), seasonings. Add broth to
  moisten to the consistancy you like (Western-style dressing tends to
  be a bit dryer than the Southern version).

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     12 tb Butter
  2 1/2 c  Onion; yellow
      3    Apples; cored
      1 lb Sausage; bulk breakfast
      3 c  Cornbread; homemade
      3 c  Bread, whole-wheat
      3 c  Bread, French
      2 ts Thyme, dried
      1 ts Sage, dried
           -salt and pepper
    1/2 c  Parsley,Italian; chopped
  1 1/2 c  Pecan halves
 
  Prepare ingredients: Core apples and cut into chunks. Do not peel.
  Jonathan and Winesap are good choices. Breads should be coarsely
  crumbled. 1. Melt half the butter in a skillet. Add chopped yellow
  onions and cook over medium heat, partially covered, until tender and
  lightly colored, about 25 minutes. Transfer onions and butter to a
  large mixing bowl. 2. Melt remaining butter in same skillet. Add
  apple chunks and cook over high heat until lightly colored but not
  mushy. Transfer apples and butter to the mixing bowl. 3. Crumble the
  sausage into the skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring, until
  lightly browned. With a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to the mixing
  bowl and reserve the rendered fat. 4. Add remaining ingredients to
  the ingredients in the mixing bowl and combine gently. Cool
  completely before stuffing the bird; refrigerate if not used
  promptly. 5. if you do not wish to actually stuff the bird (goose or
  duck, for example, can make the stuffing greasy), spoon it into a
  casserole. Cover casserole and set into a large pan. Pour got water
  around the casserole to come halfway up the sides. Bake for 30 to 45
  minutes at 325øF., basting occasionally with the cooking juices from
  the bird or with the reserved sausage fat if necessary.
   Enough stuffing for a 20-pound turkey, to make 12 to
       14    portions.

      Title: CORNED BEEF
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      8 lb Brisket; boneless
      1 c  Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Mixed pickling spices
      1    Garlic; the whole head
    1/4 ts Saltpeter
      1 pn Alum
 
  This recipe is 'supposedly' from GREENWALD'S SUPER DELICATESSEN,
  Louisville, KY. It was in LOVE AND KNISHES; Sara Kasdan; 1956. Sara
  says it comes from a 'hamish' deli; (very homelike) in a poor
  neighobrhood. Doubtful it still exists. And my copy of the book is on
  its way out too!!! OK here goes...Place brisket in a large stoneware
  crock and cover completely with water. Add remaining ingredients,
  stirring to distribute them evenly (I   would add more garlic and
  more peppercorns; never enough in the mix) Let it stand at room temp
  for 4 days. place in the fridge for 16 days.   Remove from the crock
  and place in a large kettle. Cover with boiling water and boil for 1
  1/2 hours. Turn off heat and let stand in water in which it has
  cooked for at least 2 hours. Remove meat to another deep kettle.
  Place in sink and let cold waater run into the kettle (not directly
  ON the meat) for 1 hour. (this seals the meat juices) Remove brisket
  from the water and refrigerate unntil ready to use. If you serve hot;
  steanm...do NOT boil. Well let me add that she quotes Mr. Greenwald.
  "You have to be crazy to go to all this trouble when you can buy at
  Greenwald's fancy new delicatessen." Mr. Greenwald is right...you
  HAVE TO BE CRAZY; but if you can't get it any other way...this sounds
  KOSHER to me. Perhaps one of our great Kosher cooks can come up with
  a more modern method, <grin>!!!  Oh yes, the deli moved after WWII to
  the Highland section...a fancy, 'shmancy' neighborhood.

      Title: CORNED BEEF & CABBAGE BOILED BY JAMES BEARD C
 Categories: Beef, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 lb Corned beef brisket
      1 ea Onion; peeled & stuck with:
      3 ea Cloves (for onion)
     10 lg Garlic cloves; peeled
      1 tb Pepper; freshly ground black

MMMMM------------------ACCOMPANYING VEGETABLES-----------------------
      6 md Onions; peeled
           -(stick cloves in onions)
      6 lg Carrots; scraped
      6 md Potatoes; (or 10 for hash)
      6 ea Turnips; peeled
      1 md Cabbage
 
  Note: To cook the corned beef you will need a good, 8 to 10 quart
  size pot which can be aluminum, Magnalite, Corning Ware or anything
  of that sort. The size is more important than the material. * Cooking
  the Corned Beef * Wipe the corned beef well with a damp cloth; put it
  in the pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over rather
  high heat. Boil for 5 to 6 minutes, skimming off the grey foamy scum
  that rises to the surface with a wire skimmer or large spoon. This
  will give you a clearer, purer broth. It's very important with any
  boiled meat, to skim off this scum drawn from the meat. Add the onion
  stuck with cloves, the garlic cloves, and the pepper and boil another
  10 minutes, skimming. Then reduce the heat to a simmer (250dF on a
  burner with a thermostat), cover the pot, and let it simmer at a
  faint, gentle ebullition for 2 hours. At this point test the meat for
  tenderness with a large fork. As this is not a very tender piece of
  meat, it will offer some resistance, but it should just yield to the
  fork. You must be careful not to overcook corned beef or the meat
  will become dry and stringy. It's very important to maintain some
  moisture in the meat. If you are not sure about the tenderness,
  remove the meat to a plate and cut of a tiny piece from the edge and
  taste it. If you have a meat thermometer check the internal
  temperature, which should be between 145dF and 150dF. If the meat
  seems tender turn off the heat and let it rest in the liquid. If it
  does not test tender either continue cooking or, if you have started
  it in the morning and are ahead of serving time, leave it in the
  liquid and finish the cooking later. * Cooking the Vegetables * Start
  1 hour before serving. Traditionally, all the vegetables for a corned
  beef dinner are cooked in the pot with the meat. I have long since
  decided that the vegetables look and taste better if they are cooked
  separately in plain salted water, instead of in a briny, fatty broth.
  If you have sufficient pots and burners, I recommend that you follow
  this procedure, as each vegetable will then retain its own character
  and flavor. However, it is perfectly acceptable to cook the potatoes
  with the beef, provided you scrub them and leave them in their skins
  so they don't absorb the fat, and to use only one extra pot, first
  putting in the longest-cooking vegetables (the onions and carrots),
  then the turnips, and finally the cabbage. Or, if you have a large
  pot and a steamer, put the onions and carrots in the water and steam
  the turnips over them. Cook the cabbage separately.
                            Here is a timetable for the vegetables:
  :   ONIONS. Put in a pot with water to cover, season with 1 tblsp
  salt. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer 1 hour or until crisply
  tender when tested with the point of a knife. :   CARROTS. Follow the
  same procedure, seasoning the water with 2 tsps salt and 1/2 tsp.
  marjoram. Simmer 30 minutes, or until tender when tested.
  :   POTATOES. Scrub but to not peel. Follow the same procedure,
  seasoning the water with 1 tblsp salt, or simmer with the corned beef
  for 30 minutes or until tender. If you are planning to make corned
  beer hash, cook the 4 extra potatoes, otherwise allow 1 potato per
  person. : TURNIPS. Leave whole if small; halve or quarter if large.
  Follow the same procedure, seasoning the water with 3 tsps salt.
  Simmer for 20 minutes or until tender when tested.
  :   CABBAGE. Remove coarse or discolored outer leaves and cut in
  sixths. Put in a pot with water to cover, seasoned with 2 tsps salt;
  cover. Bring to a boil and boil rapidly for 10 to 12 minutes, or
  until just tender but not overcooked or soggy. When ready to serve,
  remove the beef and discard the broth as it cannot be saved for any
  other use. Let the beef stand on a hot platter in a warm place for 10
  minutes, to firm and settle the meat. This makes it easier to carve.
  Surround it with the drained vegetables, the potatoes still in their
  skins. Do not add butter. The vegetables are better plain. Slice only
  as much meat as you need, keeping the rest in one piece for future
  use. (Corned beef hash, or cold corned beef sandwiches). Serve with a
  variety of mustards, horseradish, and, if you have any, good homemade
  pickles.

  Place corned beef in slow-cooking (Crockpot) pot. Barely cover with
  water. Add onion, garlic and bay leaves. Cover, and cook on Low for
  10 to 12 hours.
    If cabbage is desired, lift cooked corned beef out of pot, turn
  control to High, and drop wedges of cabbage into corned beef broth.
  Cover, and cook 20 to 30 minutes, or until cabbage is done. NOTE:
  from past experience, the cabbage will need more time than that.

      Title: CORNED BEEF & CABBAGE~ BOILED BY JAMES BEAR
 Categories: Main dish, Meats, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 lb Corned beef brisket
      1 ea Onion; peeled & stuck with:
      3 ea Cloves (for onion)
     10 lg Garlic cloves; peeled
      1 tb Pepper; freshly ground black

MMMMM------------------ACCOMPANYING VEGETABLES-----------------------
      6 md Onions; peeled
           -(stick cloves in onions)
      6 lg Carrots; scraped
      6 md Potatoes; (or 10 for hash)
      6 ea Turnips; peeled
      1 md Cabbage
 
  Note: To cook the corned beef you will need a good, 8 to 10 quart
  size pot which can be aluminum, Magnalite, Corning Ware or anything
  of that sort. The size is more important than the material. * Cooking
  the Corned Beef * Wipe the corned beef well with a damp cloth; put it
  in the pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over rather
  high heat. Boil for 5 to 6 minutes, skimming off the grey foamy scum
  that rises to the surface with a wire skimmer or large spoon. This
  will give you a clearer, purer broth. It's very important with any
  boiled meat, to skim off this scum drawn from the meat. Add the onion
  stuck with cloves, the garlic cloves, and the pepper and boil another
  10 minutes, skimming. Then reduce the heat to a simmer (250dF on a
  burner with a thermostat), cover the pot, and let it simmer at a
  faint, gentle ebullition for 2 hours. At this point test the meat for
  tenderness with a large fork. As this is not a very tender piece of
  meat, it will offer some resistance, but it should just yield to the
  fork. You must be careful not to overcook corned beef or the meat
  will become dry and stringy. It's very important to maintain some
  moisture in the meat. If you are not sure about the tenderness,
  remove the meat to a plate and cut of a tiny piece from the edge and
  taste it. If you have a meat thermometer check the internal
  temperature, which should be between 145dF and 150dF. If the meat
  seems tender turn off the heat and let it rest in the liquid. If it
  does not test tender either continue cooking or, if you have started
  it in the morning and are ahead of serving time, leave it in the
  liquid and finish the cooking later. * Cooking the Vegetables * Start
  1 hour before serving. Traditionally, all the vegetables for a corned
  beef dinner are cooked in the pot with the meat. I have long since
  decided that the vegetables look and taste better if they are cooked
  separately in plain salted water, instead of in a briney, fatty
  broth. If you have sufficient pots and burners, I recommend that you
  follow this procedure, as each vegetable will then retain its own
  character and flavor. However, it is perfectly acceptable to cook the
  potatoes with the beef, provided you scrub them and leave them in
  their skins so they don't absorb the fat, and to use only one extra
  pot, first putting in the longest-cooking vegetables (the onions and
  carrots), then the turnips, and finally the cabbage. Or, if you have
  a large pot and a steamer, put the onions and carrots in the water
  and steam the turnips over them. Cook the cabbage separately.
                        Here is a timetable for the vegetables:
  :   ONIONS. Put in a pot with water to cover, season with 1 tblspn
  salt. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer 1 hour or until crisply
  tender when tested with the point of a knife. :   CARROTS. Follow the
  same procedure, seasoning the water with 2 tspns salt and 1/2 tspn
  marjoram. Simmer 30 minutes, or until tender when tested.
  :   POTATOES. Scrub but to not peel. Follow the same procedure,
  seasoning the water with 1 tblspn salt, or simmer with the corned
  beef for 30 minutes or until tender. If you are planning to make
  corned beer hash, cook the 4 extra potatoes, otherwise allow 1 potato
  per person. : TURNIPS. Leave whole if small; halve or quarter if
  large. Follow the same procedure, seasoning the water with 3 tspns
  salt. Simmer for 20 minutes or until tender when tested.
  :   CABBAGE. Remove coarse or discolored outer leaves and cut in
  sixths. Put in a pot with water to cover, seasoned with 2 tspns salt;
  cover. Bring to a boil and boil rapidly for 10 to 12 minutes, or
  until just tender but not overcooked or soggy. When ready to serve,
  remove the beef and discard the broth as it cannot be saved for any
  other use. Let the beef stand on a hot platter in a warm place for 10
  minutes, to firm and settle the meat. This makes it easier to carve.
  Surround it with the drained vegetables, the potatoes still in their
  skins. Do not add butter. The vegetables are better plain. Slice only
  as much meat as you need, keeping the rest in one piece for future
  use. (Corned beef hash, or cold corned beef sandwiches). Serve with a
  variety of mustards, horseradish, and, if you have any, good homemade
  pickles.

  heat. Brush melted jelly over brisket, broil 5 minutes or until the
  brisket is glazed. Carve the brisket diagonally across the grain into
  thin slices and serve with cabbage. Makes 10 servings. Note: If
  desired, potatoes and carrots can be added to the corned beef during
  the last half-hour of simmering. Reserve the briskey cooking liquid
  to make split pea soup later.  strain cooled broth, the chill it.
  Remove fat that hardens at surface and use defatted stock in the soup.

      Title: CORNED BEEF HASH (CLAIBORNE)
 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  2 3/4 lb Corned beef
      3    Potatoes (about 1 1/2 lb)
           Salt to taste
      1 tb Butter
      1 c  Finely chopped onions
    1/2 c  Finely chopped green pepper
      1    Egg
      1    Egg yolk
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
           Fresh ground pepper to taste
      8 ts Butter or vegetable oil
 
  From "The New York Times Cook Book," Craig Claiborne. Harper and Row,
  1990.
  
  Put the corned beef in a kettle and add water to cover to a depth of
  about 2". Bring to a boil and let simmer uncovered 1 hour. Cover
  closely and continue cooking 3 hours.
  
  Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a saucepan and add cold water to cover
  and salt. Cook until almost tender but relatively firm, 20-30
  minutes. The potatoes must not be overcooked or they will not cube
  properly. Drain and let cool. Peel the potatoes and cut them into
  very small dice. There should be about 3 1/2 cups. When the corned
  beef is cooked, remove and let cool. Heat the butter in a skillet and
  add the onions and green pepper. Cook, stirring, until wilted.
  
  Trim away and discard the fat from the corned beef. Cut the corned
  beef into very thin slices and cut the slices into very small cubes.
  There should be about 5 cups. Put the cubed meat into a mixing bowl
  and add the potatoes and onion mixture. Add the egg and egg yolk,
  Worcestershire, salt and pepper and blend thoroughly with the
  fingers. Press down with the fingers to make the mass compact. Cover
  with clear plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Shape the mixture into 8 portions of more or less equal size. (Or, if
  you prefer, heat butter or oil in a nonstick skillet and cover the
  bottom with hash.) Flatten each portion into patties. Heat 1 teaspoon
  of butter or oil for each patty to be cooked. Cook 2 or 3 minutes on
  one side, or until brown. Turn the patty and cook 2 or 3 minutes on
  the other side, or until brown. Serve if desired, with a poached egg
  atop each patty.
