      Title: BUTTERMILK-APRICOT SCONES
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
      2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt

MMMMM---------------------MOIST INGREDIENTS--------------------------
    1/4 c  Margarine or butter, chilled
           -and cut into small pieces
    1/3 c  Chopped dried apricots
    1/4 c  Buttermilk or yogurt
    1/4 c  Apricot nectar
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
 
  Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl; cut in margarine with a pastry
  blender (or two forks) until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add
  the apricots and toss well, making sure each piece is well coated in
  flour and not clumped up with other apricot pieces. Make a well in
  the center of the mixture.  Combine buttermilk, apricot nectar, and
  egg; add to the well and mix with dry ingredients, until dry
  ingredients are moistened (dough will be sticky).
  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, flour you hands, and
  kneaded 4-5 times or knead it while still in the bowl (not
  traditional, but it seems to work for me). Pat dough into a 9" circle
  on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray.  Cut dough into 8
  wedges. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes, or until golden.
  
  Serve warm.
  
  Each scone will be around 230 calories (30% from fat) more or less,
  depending on the fat content of the buttermilk. I find yogurt works
  as well as buttermilk in the recipe. You could also brush the top of
  the scones with a little beaten egg white and sprinkle with sugar
  before backing, for a little extra sweetness.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Butternut squash and carrot casserole -- A delicious Thanksgiving
  or Christmas casserole.  My mother makes this at the holidays. I
  don't know where she originally got the recipe. Yield: Serves 10.
  
  *  Cinnamon sugar is a mixture of sugar and powdered cinnamon.
  Commercial cinnamon sugar mixtures are mostly sugar. My mom prepares
  her own mixture with the emphasis decidedly on the cinnamon.

 Categories: Desserts, Pies
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Milk
      2 lg Egg yolks
      1 lg Whole egg
      3 tb Cornstarch
      3 tb Firmly packed brown sugar
      2 tb Unsalted butter, softened
  1 1/2 ts Unflavored gelatin
      3 tb Cold water
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
  1 1/3 c  Heavy cream
      2 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Scotch  (up to 3)
    1/4 ts Salt
      3    Firm-ripe bananas

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4    Stick (6 tablespoons) cold
           -unsalted butter, cut into
           -bits
      2 tb Cold vegetable shortening
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Ice water  (up to 4)
 
  Make pastry dough: In a bowl with a pastry blender or in a food
  processor blend or pulse together flour, butter, shortening, and salt
  until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 tablespoons ice water and
  toss with a fork or pulse until water is incorporated. Add enough
  remaining ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing or pulsing to
  incorporate, until mixture begins to form a dough. On a work surface
  smear dough in 3 or 4 forward motions with heel of hand to slightly
  develop gluten in flour and make dough easier to work with. Form
  dough into a ball and flatten to form a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in
  plastic wrap, 1 hour. Makes enough dough for a single-crust 9- to
  10-inch pie.
  
  Make pie: On a lightly floured surface roll out dough into an 11-inch
  round (about 1/8 inch thick) and fit into a 9-inch (1-quart) metal
  pie plate, crimping edge decoratively. Prick shell all over with a
  fork and chill 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line shell with
  foil and fill with pie weights or beans. Bake shell in middle of oven
  15 minutes. Carefully remove foil and pie weights or beans and bake
  shell 5 minutes more, or until pale golden. Cool shell on a rack. In
  a large heavy saucepan bring milk just to a boil and remove pan from
  heat. In a large heatproof bowl whisk together yolks, whole egg,
  cornstarch, and brown sugar until combined well. Gradually whisk in
  hot milk and pour mixture into pan. Cook mixture over moderately high
  heat, whisking constantly, until it just comes to a boil and is
  thickened. Remove pastry cream from heat and, scraping with a
  spatula, force through a fine sieve set over another large heatproof
  bowl. Whisk in butter until incorporated. In a very small saucepan
  sprinkle gelatin over water and let stand about 1 minute to soften.
  Heat gelatin mixture over low heat until gelatin is dissolved. Stir
  gelatin mixture into pastry cream and cool. In a dry heavy saucepan
  cook granulated sugar over moderate heat, without stirring, until it
  begins to melt. Continue cooking sugar, stirring with a fork, until
  melted and swirl pan until caramel is a deep golden. Remove pan from
  heat and carefully add 1/3 cup heavy cream down side of pan (caramel
  will bubble up and steam). Return pan to heat and simmer, stirring,
  until caramel is dissolved. Stir in vanilla, Scotch, and salt until
  combined and cool sauce. Stir sauce into pastry cream until combined
  well. In a bowl beat 1/2 cup remaining heavy cream until it just
  holds stiff peaks and fold into pastry cream. Cut 2 bananas into
  1/4-inch slices and fold into pastry cream. Pour filling into shell
  and chill, covered loosely, 4 hours or overnight. Beat remaining 1/2
  cup heavy cream until it just holds stiff peaks and spread on pie.
  Cut remaining banana into 1/4-inch slices and arrange decoratively on
  pie.

      2 ts Vanilla

    1/2 c  Butter
      3 c  Sifted confectioners sugar
      2 ts Instant coffee*
 
  * dissolved in 2 Tablespoons hot water
  
   These chewy squares ooze brown sugary butterscotch. They becrumb the
  lips and besmear the chin, like home-baked goodies should.
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø.
  
   Melt butter in a large saucepan. Add sugar and beat well to mix.
  Cool the mixture slightly, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.
  
   Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Stir it into the wet
  ingredients, then add the nuts. Mix well. Spread brownies in a
  greased 11 x 7 x 2-inch pan and bake at 350ø for 30 to 35 minutes or
  until a light gold. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out.
  This is easiest if you up-end the pan over waxed paper, then turn the
  cake right side up. Let it finish cooling on a rack.
  
   To make the frosting, cream 1/2 cup butter with confectioners sugar.
  Beat it until light, then beat in the coffee mixture. Spread over the
  brownies. When frosting has set, cut in squares.

      Title: BUTTERSCOTCH ROLLED COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Christmas
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
MMMMM--------------------------COOKIES-------------------------------
      1 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
      1    Egg
    1/2 ts Vanilla
  1 3/4 c  Flour, sifted
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Cinnamon

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
      1    Egg white,
           -slightly beaten
      1 tb Butter, melted
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Food coloring
           -(optional)
 
  Mix sugar, salt and butter thoroughly.  Add egg and vanilla and beat
  till fluffy.
  
  Sift flour, baking powder, soda and cinnamon and add to mixture. Chill
  well, several hours, or overnight.
  
  MAKE THE GLAZE:  Mix the glaze ingredients together until smooth.
  
  Roll the dough out until it is about 1/8 inch thick. Cut into fancy
  shapes and bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 8-10 minutes at 350
  degrees F. Let cool and glaze.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rolled cookies for the Christmas holidays -- I almost never make
  these cookies except at Christmas time. They just seem to be
  Christmas cookies.
   (I did make a batch of heart shaped ones last Valentine's day for my
  then-fiance.)  I usually make these cookies in Christmas shapes and
  frost them with green and red frosting. This is a good recipe for
  kids to help out with.
  
  *  It helps to keep most of the dough in the refrigerator while you
  are cutting shapes.  It cuts much better when it is cold.
  
  *  These are time-consuming and fairly difficult, but worth it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chill, 1 hour cutting and
  baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: BUTTERSCOTCH WALNUT BARS
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -Crust -----------------
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Packed Light-Brown Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter, Cut In 1/2 Inch Pcs
           -Topping ----------------
    1/4 c  Light Corn Syrup
      6 oz Butterscotch Pieces
        pn Salt
      2 tb Butter Or Margarine
      1 tb Water
      8 oz Walnuts, Chopped
           Medium-Fine
 
  CRUST: In bowl mix flour, salt and sugar. With pastry blender cut in
  butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Spread mixture evenly in
  greased 13 x 9x 2 inch pan, then with hand press firmly into smooth
  compact layer. Bak ein preheated 375 degree oven about 12 minutes or
  until lightly browned. Remove pan to rack while you prepare topping.
  TOPPING: Combine syrup, butterscotch pieces, salt, butter and water
  in large heavy saucepan. With rubber spatula stir over low heat,
  pressing butterscotch until melted and smooth. (A few tiny unmelted
  pieces of butterscotch are all right.) Quickly stir in walnuts and
  remove from heat. Working quickly to prevent mixture from hardening,
  place large spoonfuls on warm baked crust. With back of spoon spread
  mixture to within 1/2 to 3/4 inch of crust edges (during baking,
  topping will run toward edges). Bake in 375 degree oven 10 minutes.
  Cool in pan 30 to 40 minutes or until only slightly warm. With small
  sharp knife loosen around edges, then cut in 16 bars. (Bars in center
  of pan will appear too soft, but they will become firm as they cool;
  wait to remove them.) With wide metal spatula transfer bars to
  cutting board; cool thoroughly until firm. Cut each bar in half.
  Makes 32

      Title: BUUREBROT / SWISS HALF-RYE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
    150 g  Rye flour
    850 g  Strong white flour
      3 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Dry yeast
 
  ("Strong white" flour is the UK term for all-purpose flour.) Mix the
  yeast in 1/2 C of the water at blood heat, and leave 15 minutes to
  proof. Sift the mixed wheat and rye flours into a mixing bowl to
  warm. When the yeast has proofed, make a well in the flour, pour the
  yeast mixture in, and cover it over with a little flour. Leave for 20
  minutes to "set the sponge". When this time has elapsed, begin mixing
  (or kneading with the dough hook if using a mixer). Add 2 cups of the
  water, check for texture, and add the rest if necessary. Knead
  vigorously. If using a dough hook, somewhere about 10 minutes into
  the process the dough will suddenly change texture and require more
  flour. Add it (probably about another 150 g). Turn the dough into an
  oiled bowl to rise. The texture will be somewhat sticky. After
  allowing to rise for 1-1&1/2 hours, turn out of the bowl, punch down,
  and divide into two loaves. Turn into nonstick pans (or greased ones)
  and allow to rise for another hour. Bake at 220C for 35 minutes. Turn
  out of the pans and allow to sit in the still-hot oven upside down
  for 5 minutes to harden the crusts. Let sit overnight before cutting.

      Title: BYRON'S FAMOUS KILLER CHEESE DIP
 Categories: Dips, Party
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     11 oz Cheese soup (one can
           -of condensed soup)
      4 oz Green chilies, chopped
           -(I use Old El Paso
           -canned chilies)
      1 md Yellow onion, chopped
      1 tb Red pepper, crushed
      2 tb Chili powder
      1 tb Cumin
      1    Garlic clove, crushed
    1/4 ts Hot sauce (Tabasco sauce
           -or hot pepper sauce)
      8 oz Sour cream
 
  Mix together all ingredients except the sour cream; heat to boiling
  at low heat.  When blended, correct seasoning (usually needs more
  cumin and garlic.) Add sour cream and heat until it bubbles slightly.
  Serve with Tostitos or any natural Mexican-style corn chip.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hot spicy party cheese dip -- Here it is, folks! By popular
  demand, the cheese dip known to make women faint, strong men cry, and
  small children run for their mommies. This started out as an attempt
  to replicate a Chili con Queso dip, but took off in its own
  direction. Yield: makes 18 oz of dip.
  
  *  This recipe may be doubled, quadruped or even sextupled without
  problem. Go easy on the red pepper if your guests don't like hot
  food. The effect, if done correctly, should be an initial impression
  of cheese, cumin, sour cream and garlic followed a second later by a
  sinus-cleaning heat. As one partaker has put it "You have to keep
  eating because if you don't, you'll die." Guaranteed to increase beer
  consumption at parties.
  
  Good Luck!
  
  : Difficulty:  very easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the spices, just so you'll know how much you
  have put in.

 Categories: Greek, Appetizers
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1    Jar grapeleaves (or fresh)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 tb Oil
      1 lb Ground beef or lamb
      2    Onions; chopped
      1    Garlic clove; pressed
      2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
      1 c  Rice
      2 tb Chopped mint
      2 tb Chopped parsley
    1/2 ts Salt
           Pepper to taste
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Currants
    1/4 c  Port wine (optional)
    1/4 c  Pine nuts or walnuts
      2 c  Water
      1    Lemon (juice only)

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      3    Eggs
      2    Lemons (stained juice only)
      1 c  Hot broth
 
  If using canned grape leaves, rinse off brine by floating leaves in a
  basin of cold water.  Prepare fresh vine leaves by pouring a cup of
  boiling water over them in a bowl.  Drain.  Spread 5 or 6 leaves out
  at a time on a flat surface.  Lay leaf stem side up. Snip off stem
  with kitchen shears.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Heat oil in large frying pan.  Fry meat, onions and
  garlic on medium heat for 5 minutes, mixing it as it cooks. Add water
  and remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Cover. Reduce heat to
  simmer and cook 10 minutes, until water is absorbed. Set aside until
  cool enough to handle.  Put 1 teaspoon of filling near stem. Bring
  left side of leaf towards center, then bring right side towards
  center. They will not always meet.  Pick up stem end of leaf, tucking
  in the filling. Roll away from you.  It will be an oblong roll like a
  sausage.
  
  Line the bottom of a large skillet with 4 leaves. Place each roll so
  that the tucked under end is on the bottom. Arrange each roll snugly,
  one next to the other, until all the leaves (except 3), and filling
  are gone. Place these leaves flat on top of rolls. Place a flat dish
  on top of rolls also to prevent their unravelling during cooking.
  
  Add water and lemon juice.  Bring to a boil.  Cover. Reduce heat to
  simmer and cook 45 minutes.  When done, remove pot from fire. Make
  Egg and Lemon Sauce and add to broth immediately or serve without
  sauce either cold as an appetizer or as a hot entree.
  
  EGG AND LEMON SAUCE: Beat eggs until thick and light yellow, at least
  5 minutes, with an electric beater or 10 to 15 minutes by hand. Add
  juice slowly, beating all the while. Mix 1 cup hot broth into beaten
  eggs, stirring it in quickly with spoon (or wire whisk) so heat will
  not curdle the eggs.  Cook over very low heat until thickened.

  This is a hearty sweet and sour meat soup that can be used as a main
  dish. Bubbies  measurements were never exact. You need to taste. Put
  meat and bones in a 8 or 12 qt stock pot. Put in cans of tomato,
  cover with water and bring to a boil. In the meantime, get your
  veggies ready. Slice beets and carrots, others go in whole. When
  stock boils, skim off top. Put in beets, carrots, garlic, and other
  veggies. Turn heat down to a simmer and keep lid on askew. After
  about an hour, put in garlic and sugar.
   I have used Sweet and Low. Amounts are a matter of preference. It
  should have a rich, sweet and sour taste. I break up the meat and
  stir it back into the soup before serving. NOTE: Sometimes I add some
  tomato paste; 2 or 3 T for body; Enjoy!!! * Elaine/Framingham *

      Title: CABBAGE & POTATOES
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Cabbage
      2    White potatoes (up to 4,
           -washed and diced; I like
           -the skins left on)
      2    Onions (chopped)
      1 tb Wine vinegar
      6 tb Bacon fat or butter
           -(or less)
           Splash water or beer
           -(whatever you're
           -drinking)
 
  Cut the cabbage in half and soak in salted water for 15 minutes.
  Agitate and drain well. Shred the cabbage.
  
  Heat the bacon fat or butter in a large, heavy skillet and add the
  diced potatoes.  Cook over medium heat until lightly browned. Add 2
  chopped onions and cook until transparent, about 5 minutes.
  
  Add cabbage and toss well with two wooden spoons, a la stir-fry. When
  the cabbage starts to wilt, add salt and freshly-ground black pepper
  to taste and a splash of that beer in your left hand and about 1 T
  wine vinegar. Cover, with lid slightly askew, and simmer over low
  heat until tender (about 30-45 minutes).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cabbage and Potatoes -- With a nod toward Nancy Mintz who reminded
  me how good cabbage can be, especially in the winter time when other
  fresh veggies are scarce. This recipe serves 8, and is good hot or
  cold.
  
  *  Like Nancy said, one cabbage goes a loooonnnngggg way, so I
  usually use a quarter to a half a head when cooking for 2.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes simmering.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  of dough, then roll it out thinly to give a round or oval shape. Put
  a little filling in the mlddle, then enclose lt in the dough,

  until all the dough and filling is used. Arrange the dumplings in a
  greased steamer and simmer and cook over boiling water for 8 minutes.

      Title: CABBAGE KIMCHEE
 Categories: Vegetarian, Ethnic, Relishes, Salsa
      Yield: 2 Quarts
 
      1 lb Chinese cabbage
      1 lb White radish
      3 tb Salt
      2 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
  1 1/2 tb Minced garlic
      5    Scallions, cut into fine
           -rounds, including green
      1 tb Cayenne
      1 ts Sugar
 
  If you are using a small, whole cabbage, cut it in half lengthwise,
  and then cut it across at 2-inch intervals. If you are using half of
  a large cabbage, cut it in half again lengthwise, and then crosswise
  at 2-inch intervals.
  
  Peel the white radish, cut it in half lengthwise, and then cut it
  crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices.  In a large bowl put 5 cups
  water and 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons of the salt. Mix. Add the
  cabbage and radish to this water and dunk them in a few times as they
  have a tendency to float.  Leave the vegetables in the salty water.
  Cover loosely and set aside for 12 hours. Turn the vegetables over a
  few times.
  
  Put the ginger, garlic, scallions, cayenne, sugar, and 1 teaspoon
  salt in another large bowl.  Mix well.
  
  Take the cabbage out of its soaking liquid with a slotted spoon (save
  the liquid) and put it in the bowl with the seasonings. Mix well.
  
  Put this cabbage mixture into a 2-quart jar or crock. Pour enough of
  the salt water over it to cover the vegetables (about 2 cups). Leave
  1 inch of empty space at the top of the jar. Cover loosely with a
  clean cloth and set aside for 3 to 7 days.  In the summer, kimchees
  mature with much greater speed;  in the winter, the process slows
  down unless the central heating is ferocious.  Taste the pickle after
  3 days to check on the sourness. When it is done to your liking,
  cover the jar and refrigerate.
  
  To serve, remove just as much of the kimchee solids as you think you
  will need for a meal--a cupful is enough for 4 people--and put it in
  the center of a bowl.  The kimchee liquid in this pickle is left
  behind in the jar and may be used to flavor stews and soups.  Serve
  this cabbage kimchee with any Korean meal.
  
  ~- Madhur Jaffrey, _World-of-the-East Vegetarian Cooking_
  
  (Be sure and keep a close eye on the kimchee after the third day. If
  mold appears, scoop out the mold, and refrigerate the kimchee
  immediately).

    1/2 sm Cabbage; chopped fine
      1 lg Baking potato, diced
      1 bn Frozen peas
      1 ts Sambar powder
           Turmeric; to taste
           Salt; to taste
           Shredded dry coconut

           Dry red chilli; (seasoning)
           Curry leaves; (seasoning)
           Oil; (seasoning)
 
  Set dal to cook in about 2 cups water and a touch turmeric. When dal
  is three-quarters done add shredded cabbage, potatoes and a little
  more water if needed on top of the dal. Add sambar powder and salt.
  
  Cover with a lid and let it simmer away another 10 to 15 minutes.
  Veggies should be done but still holding their shape. Stir in wet
  coconut. Remove from heat. Top with seasoning as explained in
  previous recipes.
  
  If more particular, grind fresh coconut with roasted red chilli and
  roasted urad dal paste in lieu of the desiccated coconut.
  
  Variations:
  
  You can do a keerai (spinach) kootan with a little modification. Add
  fresh coconut ground with roasted red chillies, urad dal and a little
  cumin. Also you can cook toovar dal separately or throw veggies + dal
  in a cooker for a few minutes, if you like. This tends to overcook
  veggies but can be done fast.

      Title: CABBAGE ROLLS (POLISH STYLE)
 Categories: Polish, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Ground Beef;lean
    1/2 c  Rice;uncooked
      1 md Onion;Diced
      1    Green Pepper;Diced
      2    Eggs
      1    Cabbage;large head
      2 qt Tomato Juice
 
  PREPARE THE CABBAGE LEAVES: The Old timers would freeze the head
  solid, then peel the leaves from the head as they thawed. The best
  way I've found is to 1)cut the core out with a knife, then put the
  hole-where-the-core- was, side down in a steamer over boiling water.
  Let it sit for about 10 minutes and remove. Several layers of the
  outer leaves should be soft enough to remove from the head. When
  you've removed as many as you can, return the head to the steamer to
  soften more leaves. Take a sharm knife and remove as much of the
  central vein as you can. FILLING: Mix all the other ingredients
  together in a bowl. work it with your hands until the eggs and other
  inredients except the tomato juice are thouroughly mixed into the
  meat. Now, take a glob of mixture and set it in the hollow of a
  deveined leaf,with the end that was near the core towards you. Fold
  the end nearest you about / way over the mix. Fold the left side over
  the mix and then the right side. Roll about / turn away from you so
  that the "seam" is on the bottom. Place in the pan seam side don and
  continue with the other leaves.* When you've made the last cabbage
  roll,pour in the tomato juice to cover. Bring to a boil then simmer
  for AT LEAST an hour. Serve in a bowl with the juice, although these,
  like spagetti are better the 2nd day.
  
  *This is an ideal cabbage roll. 3/4 of them won't go together this
  perfectly, so be ready to make adjustments when making the rolls.
  
  VARIATIONS: Garlic is great, paprika and chili powder will work in the
  stuffing, V-8 instead of tomato juice is pleasantly different.

      Title: CABRITO EN SANGRE (KID IN BLOOD)
 Categories: Mexico, Lamb/mutton
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    Baby goat, or kid (lamb can
           -be used, but it is not as
           -good)
      3    Garlic cloves
     10    Comino seeds (cumin)
           Salt to taste
    1/4 ts Marjoram
      3    Carrots, sliced thin
    1/2 c  Lard
 
  A: Meat Ingredients
  
  When the young goat is killed, have the butcher drain off the blood
  and save it in a container. Wash the carcass, cut off the lower legs,
  tail, etc., and cut the kid into conveniently sized serving pieces,
  roughly about the size of a half chicken. Place the meat in a pot
  with garlic and salt. Cover with cold water and boil for one hour.
  Stretch a triple thickness of cheesecloth, or a tea towel, over the
  top of the pot. Pour in the blood, allowing the cloth to contain the
  congealed element. Draw the ends together, tie with a string, drop
  into the pot liquid, and boil for 10 minutes. Remove the cloth
  containing the congealed blood, and force the blood through a fine
  sieve or strainer. Remove the meat from the pot, drain, and brown in
  a large skillet in very hot lard. Add the mashed blood, comino seeds,
  marjoram and sliced carrots. Add 1/2 cup of the water in which the
  goat meat was cooked. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and add
  the following ingredients to complete the sauce, as directed.
  
  B: Sauce ingredients:
  
  1/2 cup olive oil 3/4 cup white wine 10 whole peppercorns 2
  Tablespoons chili powder Tabasco to taste 1/2 teaspoon salt 10 whole
  cloves 4 bay leaves 1/4 teaspoon marjoram 2 garlic cloves 1
  Tablespoon sugar 2 Tablespoons vinegar 2 green chili peppers, cut in
  small pieces (a small green bell pepper can be substituted) 2 onions,
  finely chopped 1/2 cup Mexican (or unsweetened) chocolate, ground and
  made into a thick paste with water 2 Tablespoons flour, mixed with
  water to make a paste 1/4 cup pimientos, finely chopped
  
  Place olive oil, wine, peppercorns, chili powder, Tabasco, salt,
  cloves, bay leaves, marjoram, garlic, sugar, vinegar, chopped
  peppers, and chopped onions in a saucepan. Simmer over a low flame
  for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the chocolate paste,
  stirring constantly as the mixture boils for about 3 minutes. Add the
  flour paste and chopped pimientos, stirring until the ingredients
  thicken.
  
  C: Combination and serving:
  
  Add the sauce ingredients to the meat, blood and other contents of the
  skillet (You will have to use 2 or 3 skillets for this quantity) Stir
  well until all ingredients are thoroughly blended. This should take 2
  or 3 minutes. Serve on individual plates garnished with watercress,
  cubes of fresh pineapple, chilled seedless grapes, white radishes and
  string beans. Orange sections dipped in powdered sugar make a good
  addition. With this dish serve either tortillas or tostados, a green
  salad wit a simple oil and vinegar dressing, and beer, preferably a
  Mexican beer if you can get it.

  cold water. The skins should slip off easily. Slice the peaches.
  There should be about 1 1/2 cups.
  
  Sprinkle gelatin over the 1/4 cup of cold water in a small bowl. Set
  aside. Combine 1 cup prickly pear juice with peach slices and prickly
  pear pieces in a medium saucepan. Simmer over low heat for five
  minutes.
  
  Turn off the heat under the fruit and strain off 1 cup of juice. In a
  small saucepan, combine the juice and honey and cook gently just at a
  simmer for eight minutes. Add the softened gelatin and lemon juice to
  the honey mixture and stir until gelatin is dissolved.
  
  Puree the fruit and remaining juice in a blender. Combine with the
  gelatin and honey mixture and freeze in a bread pan or similar
  container. When nearly hard, remove from freezer, transfer to a bowl,
  and beat with an electric mixer.  Beat the whipping cream until stiff
  and fold into the fruit mixture.  Return to the bread pan. Refreeze
  until firm.

      Title: CACTUS SALAD (ENSALADA DE NOPALITOS)
 Categories: Salads, New mex, Mexican
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     24 oz Sliced or diced
           Prickly pear cactus
      2 md Tomatoes, coarsely chopped
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      2 tb Snipped fresh cilantro
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      4 ts White wine vinegar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Dried oregano leaves
           Dash of pepper
 
  This is from "Betty Crocker's New International Cookbook". According
  to the recipe, "No salad is more characteristic of Mexico than Cactus
  Salad. Nopal, or prickly pear cactus paddles, are fleshy little
  wedges that are delicious tossed with a vinaigrette.  The dressing
  above features aromatic cilantro.
        Place cactus, tomatoes, onion and cilantro in glass or plastic
  bowl. Shake remaining ingredients in tightly covered jar. Pour over
  vegetables; toss. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours. Serve on
  lettuce leaves if desired.  6 servings.
  
  NOPALES:
  
        The recipe states, "These cacti are not so viciously spined as
  many others.  The paddles (leaves) are the edible portion, a great
  favorite in Mexican cooking. Called nopalitos, they are boiled and
  eaten crisp-tender, dressed in salads, or served tender and hot, as a
  cooked vegetable. Their little spines must be removed before cooking.
  Look in specialty stores featuring Mexican groceries for cans and
  fresh nopalitos." Walt

     Make dressing by whisking together vinegar, anchovy, if desired,
  mustard, minced garlic and pepper. Slowly whisk in 1 cup olive oil,
  drop by drop at first. When all the oil has been added, whisk in
  lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce.  If you omit the anchovy,

  oil in skillet.  Saute sliced garlic until lightly browned, about 3
  minutes. Remove with slotted spoon. Add bread to oil and cook over

 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5    Anchovies
      1 tb Cracked black peppercorns
           -(see Note)
    1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
      1    Egg
      3 tb Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Pureed garlic (see Note)
      2 ts Dry mustard
      1 ts Celery salt
      3 ds Tabasco
      3 ds Worcestershire sauce
    1/2    Loaf sourdough, hearty
           -French or Italian bread,
           -with crust, diced
           For croutons
      2 md Heads romaine lettuce
 
  Zesty Tabasco and Worcestershire spice up this innovation from "City
  Cuisine" by Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken (William Morrow and
  Co., 1989).  The dressing contains lightly cooked egg, so if made
  ahead must be refrigerated.
  
  Combine anchovies, black pepper and olive oil in a blender. Puree for
  about 5 minutes until very smooth. Add grated Parmesan. Measure and
  reserve 1/3 cup for use with croutons.
  
  Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil.  Place a refrigerated egg
  on slotted spoon and into boiling water. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes;
  remove and reserve.
  
  Place vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, celery salt, Tabasco and
  Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl and whisk in anchovy mixture.
  Crack open egg and spoon (including parts the are uncooked) into
  mixture. Whisk until well combined.  Refrigerate dressing if not
  using right away. Combine reserved anchovy mixture with diced bread
  in a bowl; toss to coat. Heat a dry cast-iron skillet or non-stick
  pan over medium-high and cook croutons, stirring constantly, until
  golden and crisp.
  
  Wash and dry lettuce and break into bite-sized pieces. Place in a
  salad bowl along with dressing and toss well. Add toasted croutons,
  toss again and serve.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  NOTES: To crack peppercorns, place whole peppercorns on a work
  counter. Place the bottom of a heavy skillet or saucepan on top and
  push down and away from you.
  
  To puree garlic, place peeled garlic cloves in a blender with a dash
  of olive oil; puree.  Make in quantity, if desired, and store in the
  refrigerator as long as two weeks.

      Title: CAESAR SALAD~ "THE ORIGINAL RECIPE"
 Categories: Dressings, Salads
      Yield: 2 + servings
 
      5    Flat anchovies
      1    Head of romaine, cut into
           Strips and well chilled
      1 ts Dry mustard
      1 ts Garlic powder
    1/3 c  Olive oil
    1/8 c  Approximately, cider vinegar
           Worchestershire sauce
           Tabasco sauce
      2    Eggs, coddled
      1    Juice of lemon, or to taste
           Parmesan cheese
           Croutons
           Salt
           Fresh ground pepper
 
                               -MIKE'S KITCHEN-
  
  Many claims have been made regarding the recipes I've collected over
  the years. This one I can't help but believe: The following is the
  ORIGINAL Caesar Salad recipe, created on the spot from miscellaneous
  ingredients by Chef Caesar, in Tijuanna, in the 1920's! If this
  really isn't the original, it should be. It's that good. If the
  ingredients are balanced just right, the result is a rich, smooth,
  buttery-with-a-hint-of-lemon concoction that I have never yet found
  an equal to. The quantities of spices, etc., listed are at best close
  approximations. I estimated the measures because the salad needs to
  be mixed freehand at the table with as much (understated of course)
  fanfare as possible, and the various amounts are about what are used.
  A little experimentation should make perfect, and would be well worth
  the effort. This recipe is an instance where culinary artistry
  definitely comes into play.
  
  THE SALAD BOWL:
        Should be wooden with a rough, porous surface to "grab" the
  anchovy. Rather than being cut up in the salad, the anchovy is rubbed
  into the bowl. Though other kinds of bowls can be used--metal,
  ceramic, smooth wood--they neither pulverize the anchovy as well, nor
  do they hold the aroma.
  
  THE INGREDIENTS:
        Before hand, cut the romaine crosswise into eating-sized strips.
  Chill to crisp. When ready to serve the salad, place in the
  anchovy-seasoned bowl. In another smaller bowl, mix the garlic powder
  and dry mustard, and sprinkle over the romaine. Mix lightly to spread
  the seasonings. (As an alternative, flavor olive oil with garlic and
  use that in place of the the garlic powder and the regular olive oil
  the recipe calls for.) Add 4 - 5 dashes (approx.) of Worchestershire
  sauce and the same of Tabasco, depending on taste. Mix lightly again.
  Add the oil and vinegar.
        In yet another small bowl, thoroughly beat the coddled eggs
  with a small wire whip, and add to the romaine. Add lemon, salt, and
  fresh ground pepper, to taste. Though a little bit of vinegar is
  important to the recipe, lemon is the more primary of the two
  ingredients, and should be the one adjusted to taste. Add croutons
  and parmesan cheese in the amounts desired, and mix thoroughly.
        Serve on chilled dinner plates. Garnish with more croutons and
  parmesan to taste. Some of the croutons will be soaked with the
  dressing, while the ones used to garnish will add a crunchy texture.
  Also, garnish with crossed strips of anchovy, if desired.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
  2 1/2 ts Yeast
      2 c  Bread flour
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/2    Garlic cloves, crushed
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/2 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Parmesan, grated
      3 tb Olive oil
      4    Anchovies; chopped
    1/2 ts Lemon peel, grated
  1 1/2 c  Sourdough starter
    1/2 c  Water; warm
 
  Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
  order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
  push Start.
  
  In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
  
  If Caesar made bread instead of salad dressing, this would be it.
  Sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes or tuna salad, or serve it with a
  green salad. For an hors d'oeuvre, toast slices and top with steak
  tartare or a sliver of rare roast beef. The crusty ends can be cut
  into croutons, toasted in a frying pan, and tossed in a salad.

      6    To 12 fresh jalapenos,
           -stems removed
     12    Tomatillos, husks removed
    1/2    White onion, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
    1/3 c  White wine vinegar
    2/3 c  Water
      2 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 bn Cilantro, chopped
           (about 1 cup)
 
  Combine all the ingredients except cilantro in a pot and bring to a
  boil. Cover, lover the heat, and simmer for about 10 minutes or until
  the tomatillos are soft. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
  Transfer the cooled ingredients and the liquid to a blender.  Add the
  cilantro, and puree until smooth and uniformly green. Refrigerate.
  Makes about two cups. Serve cold or at room temperature. It's
  wonderful served with grilled meats....a pork chop, for example. It's
  also very nice mixed with some yogurt to toss with hot pasta for a
  low-fat quick dinner. And stir some into some soup; it will perk up
  almost anything without being overwhelming.

       Marinara is very thick. If it is too runny, the liquid from the

       strongly seasoned so that only the minumum need be added to give
       the right flavor. We serve this light natural tasting steamed

 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 cn Eagle Brand Condensed Milk
           -(caramelized)
    1/4 c  Hot coffee
    1/2 c  Pecan nut meats
 
  (This recipe earned $25 for Mrs. George H. Plum, 440 Camden Ave.,
  Moorestown, New Jersey.)
  
  Blend caramelized Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk (see Magic
  Caramel Pudding recipe), and hot coffee, beating until smooth. Chop
  pecan nut meats and add. Pour into sherbet glasses. Chill. May be
  garnished with whipped cream.  Serves six.
  
  NOTE:  I have just completed assembling the above recipe. Tastes
  good. If it sets up a bit more it will make a nice pudding. If it was
  heated, it would be nice over a couple of scoops of vanilla ice
  cream. No way it's gonna serve six, though.

  One of New Orleans' oldest food establishments, Cafe Sbisa was
  founded by the Sbisa family in 1899, in what was then the thriving
  port and financial district of the old French city. In 1977, the
  business was purchased by two local restauranteurs who completely
  restored the historic building and reopened the cafe two years later.
  The menu still reflects many of the great traditions of "la cuisine
  Creole", but has been expanded to include the finest products from
  across the United States.

  Saute three to five minutes or until all vegetables are wilted. Add
  shrimp, crabmeat and crawfish. Cook for an additional ten minutes.
  Deglaze pan with white wine and lemon juice, and continue cooking
  until volume of liquid is reduced to one half. Add heavy whipping
  cream and, stirring constantly, reduce until cream is thick and of a
  sauce like consistency, approximately five minutes. Add diced red
  bell pepper and chipped butter, two to three pats at a time, swirling
  pan constantly over burner. Do not stir with a spoon, as butter will
  break down and separate if hot spots develop in the pan. Continue
  adding butter until all is incorporated. Remove from heat, add
  parsley and season to taste using salt and pepper. Gently fold in
  cooked fettuccine and serve. May be chilled and served as a cold
  pasta salad.

      2 tb Cooking oil
      1 sm Onion, chopped

      1    Green bell pepper,
           -diced
      1 lb Tomatoes, sliced,
           -in puree
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Grated lemon peel
    1/2 ts Chili powder
      1 c  Rice

MMMMM-------------------------SPICE MIX------------------------------
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 ts Paprika
    1/8 ts Garlic powder
 
  Trim the lamb of any excess fat.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix
  together the spice mix ingredients, and rub over the lamb. Let stand
  for 15 minutes. Heat oil in a skillet. Sear the lamb until all sides
  are browned. Remove lamb to a roasting pan. Roast lamb for 35 to 40
  minutes.
  
  While the lamb is cooking, add onions and peppers to the skillet used
  for searing the lamb.  Saute until soft. Add tomatoes, chicken stock,
  basil, lemon and chili powder. Bring to a boil and add the rice.
  Reduce heat and simmer until liquid is absorbed.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is a spicy lamb dish that I picked up originally from a local
  newspaper.  Yield:  serves 2-3.
  
  *  Often when boning a leg of lamb you end up with a very ragged
  piece of meat.  Just chop it up into boxy pieces and use more spice
  mix to cover all the surfaces. You will be slicing up the roast
  before serving anyhow.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

  onions, celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, Tabasco,
  Worcestershire and seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking
  excessively, about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the
  pan bottom well. Stir in the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for
  about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow
  mixture to cool to room temperature.
  
  Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13 by 9 backing pan.
  Add the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture (removing the bay leaves)
  and the bread crumbs.  Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the
  center of the pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1 1/2
  inches high, 6 inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350
  degrees for 25 minutes, then raise heat to 400 degrees and continue
  cooking until done, about 35 minutes longer.  Serve immediately as is
  or with "Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef" (separate recipe).

    1/4 c  Salt
      2 ea Onions, thinly sliced

      1 tb Plus 2 tsp, white pepper
      1 tb Plus 2 tsp, fennel seeds
      1 tb Plus 3/4 tsp, black pepper
  2 1/2 ts Dry mustard
  2 1/2 ts Ground cayenne pepper
 
  Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and save.
  Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large roasting
  pan. Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through the
  silver skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very generous,
  even layer of black pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper
  should completely cover it); repeat with the garlic powder, then the
  salt, totally covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the
  onions in an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.
  Place the fat cap back on top. Refrigerate 24 hours. Bake ribs in a
  550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on top, about 35
  minutes. Remove from oven and cool slightly. Refrigerate until well
  chilled, about 3 hours.  (this is done so the juices will solidify
  and the steaks can be cooked rare.) Remove fat cap and disgard.  With
  the blade of a large knife, scrape off the onions and as much of the
  seasonings as possible and discard. Then with a long knife, slice
  between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have bones); trim the cooked
  surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were on the outside of the
  roast. Season and cook in your favorite way for steaks. TO BLACKEN
  THE STEAKS: Combine the ingredients of the seasoning mix thoroughly
  in a small bowl; you will have about 8 tablespoons. Sprinkle the
  steaks generously and evenly on both sides with the mix. using about
  4 teaspoons on each steak and pressing it in with your hands. Heat a
  cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the smoking
  stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least 10
  minutes.  (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.)  Place one
  steak in the hot skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook over
  a very high heat until the underside starts to develop a heavy, black
  crust, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the steak over and cook until the
  underside is crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more.
  Repeat with the remaining steaks.  Serve each steak while piping hot.
  (*NOTE*:  If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove,
  this dish may smoke you out of the kitchen. It's worth it! But you
  can also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get
  hot enough to "blacken" the steak properly. If you have a smoke
  detector in your house, you will be able to determine if it is
  working correctly. This is NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment
  building with a central fire alarm system wired into your smoke
  detector.  It causes great excitement! Also, you can be guaranteed
  you will meet your landlord.) From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

  ;-) Cajun Prime Rib - Blackened
  
  Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and save.
  Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large roasting

  onions in an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.
  Place the fat cap back on top. Refrigerate
       24    hours.
  
  Bake ribs in a 550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on
  top, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cool slightly.
  Refrigerate until well chilled, about 3 hours. (This is done so the
  juices will solidify and the steaks can be cooked rare.) Remove fat

  with a long knife, slice between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have
  bones); trim the cooked surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were
  on the outside of the roast. Season and cook in your favorite way for
  steaks.
  
  TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS: Combine the ingredients of the seasoning mix
  thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8 Tb. Sprinkle the
  steaks generously and evenly on both sides with the mix. using about
  4 ts on each steak and pressing it in with your hands.
  
  Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the

  10 minutes. (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.) Place

  1 1/2 c  Julienned zucchini (see note
      1 c  Julienned squash (see Note)
      1 x  Very Hot Cajun Sauce/Beef
 
    NOTE:  To julienne squashes, cut peelings 1/8 inch thick and cut
  these
    into strips 1/8 inch wide and 2 inches long; use only strips that
  have
    skin on one surface.  Cut carrots and onions into similar strips.
    In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the beef and pork. Mix
    in the eggs and bread crumbs by hand until thoroughly mixed. Set
    aside.    In a 1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the
  butter,
    the onions, celery, bell peppers, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco
  and
    meat seasoning mix.  Saute over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring
    frequently and scraping the pan bottom well.  Remove from heat and
    cool.  Add the sauteed vegetable mixture and 1/4 cup of the milk to
    the meat and mix well by hand.  Form into a 12x8-inch loaf and
  center
    in the pan.  Bake at 450F until brown on top, about
       30    minutes.
    Remove from oven; pour off drippings, reserve 2-1/2 tablespoons. Set
    meat and drippings aside.    Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork
    tender; drain, reserving about 1 cup of the water. Place the
    potatoes, while still hot, in a large mixing bowl with the
  remaining 1
    stick butter, 1/2 cup milk, the salt and white pepper. Stir with a
    wooden spoon until broken up, then beat with a metal whisk (or
    electric mixer with a paddle) until creamy and velvety smooth.
  (NOTE:
    Mix in some of the reserved potato water if potatoes are not creamy
    enough.)  In a large skillet (preferably non-stick) combine the
    reserved drippings with the carrots, onions and vegetable seasoning
    mix; saute over high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add
  the
    zucchini and yellow squash and continue sauteing until vegetables
  are
    noticeably brighter in color, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring
    occasionally.  Remove from heat.    Mound undrained vegetables on
  top
    of the meat loaf, away from the edges.  Layer the mashed potatoes
    evenly over the top of the vegetables and top edges of the meat,
  using
    all the potatoes.  Bake at 525F until brown on top, about 8 to 10
    minutes.  Serve immediately with about 1/2 cup Very Hot Cajun Sauce
    (see recipe) under each serving. From Paul Prudhommes "Louisiana

      Title: CAJUN SOFT-SHELL CRABS ON BUNS
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 md Soft-shell crabs, cleaned
      1 c  Skim milk
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper, or to taste
      4 tb Low-fat butter
      4    Round sandwich buns or
           -rolls, toasted
      4 tb Cajun Mayonnaise
      2    Scallions, thinly sliced
 
  Soft-shell crabs are one of the great culinary joys of springtime.
  They should be purchased fresh, and most fish markets are happy to
  clean them for you. If not, the technique takes a little courage, but
  once you get the knack, it's really quite easy: Rinse each crab under
  cold water and, with scissors, snip off the head about 1/4" behind
  the eyes. Turn the crab over on its back; lift and pull off the
  triangular apron on the lower part of the shell. Flip the crab over
  and pull back the points of the top shell. Remove and discard the
  gills on both sides. Rinse the cleaned crab and pat dry.
  
  1. Soak prepared crabs in milk for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bag,
  combine flour, paprika, garlic powder and cayenne. Shake well;
  reserve.
  
  2. Remove the crabs from the milk and dredge in the seasoned flour.
  Shake off any excess flour.
  
  3. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute crabs,
  two at a time, for 4-5 minutes per side, or until crispy and browned.
  Remove to a paper towel to drain.
  
  4. Spread each toasted bun with 1 tablespoon of Cajun Mayonnaise, or
  more if desired. Sprinkle scallions on bottom half of bun, then top
  with a crab. Cover with top half of the bun and serve immediately.

 Categories: Spices
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  2 Tablespoons Red Pepper 1 Tablespoon Black Pepper 1 Tablespoon White
  Pepper 1 Tablespoon Thyme 1 1/2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder 1 1/2 Teaspoon
  Onion Powder 1
      1/2    Teaspoon Seasoned salt
  
  Mix peppers, herbs and spices, store in an air tight container.
  
  Spice is great on most all meats; including pork chops and steaks;
  chicken and seafoods.  The food to be blackened should be moistened
  on both sides with butter or margarine. Then coated with the spice
  mix. The coated meat should then be cooked in a white hot cast iron
  skillet on both sides until degree of wellness is reached and spice
  looks like a black crust. Shrimp should be peeled, leaving only the
  tails on. Foods my also be cooked on very hot grill. Always cook in
  well ventilated area, as mixture may smoke alot.  Amount of coating
  is to taste.  This is a very spicy mix. Start lite and work your way
  up.
  
  Blackened shrimp makes for great appetizer along with a good cocktail
  sauce.  Shrimp need to be attened continually while cooking as it only
  requires a couple minutes each side.

  This spice mix is loosly based on a spice mix from the Prudhomme

  can be used to season any seafood dish. I also use it to season
  Porcupine Meatballs and other "cajun" inspired dishes.

  1 1/2 tb Garlic powder
      1 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Dried oregano leaves
    1/2 ts Dried basil leaves

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Ground mace
 
  Combine all ingredients.  Rub mixture into meat.  If grilling, let
  meat stand 30 minutes.  This works well when smoking brisket. Rub
  mixture on meaty side of 2 briskets. Do not trim fat from fat side.
  Place meaty sides together, roll, and retie.  Place in smoker for 8
  to 10 hours depending on size of brisketss.  Use meat thermometer to
  determine doneness. For ribs, rub mixture all over ribs and cook as
  you alwaaaays do. This amount will be enough for 6 to 8 pork chops.
  On you can use it on hamburger patties

  horizons...  Note the use of the 'trinity'.
  
  Pour oil from above into bottom of stock pot, adding enough to cover
  the bottom of the pot, if necessary. Make a roux by adding an equal
  amount of flour, cooking until thickened. Add the following:
  
  Simmer for 25 minutes.  Add drained tofu, place lid on pot and simmer
  for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 3 or 4 fresh bay
  leaves and let cool for 15 minutes. Reheat if necessary and serve
  over steamed rice. Top with fresh parsley.
  
  If a less spicy mix is desired, the amount of red pepper can be
  reduced to taste.

 Categories: Desserts, Cajun
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      7 tb Butter, unsalted; melted
    1/4 c  Butter, unsalted; melted
     16 c  French bread cubes, dry
           -packed
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Vanilla extract
      1 ts Nutmeg, grated
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
      3 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Sultanas
    3/4 c  Coconut, flaked
    1/2 c  Pecans, toasted; coarsely
           -chopped

MMMMM-------------------------RUM SAUCE------------------------------
      1 c  Butter, unsalted
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      2    Egg; beaten until frothy
    1/2 c  Dark rum

MMMMM-------------------------SOFT CREAM------------------------------
      1 pt Whipping cream
    1/3 c  Sugar, confectioners,
           -sifted
      1 tb Pure vanilla extract
      2 tb Cognac
      2 ts Frangelico Liqueur
    1/4 c  Dairy sour cream
 
  Pour 7 tablespoons butter into a 13" x 9" baking pan; swirl it around
  to coat bottom and sides.  Pour excess butter and additional 1/4 cup
  butter into a small bowl; set aside. Place bread cubes in buttered
  baking dish; set aside.  In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar with an
  electric mixer until thickened and light lemon-coloured, 3 to 4
  minutes. Add vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, milk, raisins, coconut,
  pecans and reserved butter; beat on low speed to combine.  Pour
  liquid over bread in baking dish; stir to distribute nuts, coconut
  and raisins evenly. Set pan aside until bread has absorbed all of
  liquid, 30 to 45 minutes. Press bread down into liquid often to cover
  all cubes with liquid. Preheat oven to 350F. Bake in preheated oven
  until crusty and golden brown on top, 45 to 60 minutes. While pudding
  is baking, prepare Rum Sauce and Soft Cream. Cool bread pudding to
  lukewarm.  When bread pudding has cooled, slice into squares. Place a
  spoonful of rum sauce in botttom of each serving bowl; add a square
  of bread pudding.  Top with a generous dollop of cream. Makes 15 to
  18 servings.
  
  TO PREPARE RUM SAUCE, using an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar
  mixture until light and fluffy.  Put mixture in top of a double
  boiler over simmering water; cook 20 minutes, whisking often. The
  mixture should be silky smooth and light in colour.  Whisk 2
  tablespoons hot butter mixture into beaten eggs, then 2 tablespoons
  more. Whisk warmed egg mixture slowly into remaining butter mixture.
  Cook mixture over barely simmering water until thickened, 4 to 5
  minutes, whisking constantly. Cool slightly; whisk in rum. Sauce may
  be kept warm over hot water until served.
  
  TO PREPARE SOFT CREAM, chill beaters and a medium bowl until very
  cold. Place all ingredients in bowl; beat with an electric mixer on
  medium- high speed until soft, loose peaks from, 3 to 4 minutes. The
  cream should have a slightly runny, cloud-like consistency that
  softly drapes over the bread pudding.  Do not overbeat. Cover tightly
  and refrigerate until served.
  
  "I know of no dessert that gives me greater pleasure than the bread
  pudding desserts I discovered during my trips to Louisiana. This
  version is light and airy rather than heavy and dense. It has an
  exciting combination of tastes and textures to please your mouth. It
  is sinfully rich and guaranteed to please the most ardent dessert
  fan. I'm sure you will enjoy this as much as I did."

      1 c  Matzo meal
      1 c  Matzo cake meal
    1/2 c  Sugar

        pn Ground cloves
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      1 lg Egg
    3/4 c  ;cold water
     16    Whole almonds blanched or
           Almonds unblanched

MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
    2/3 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  ;cold water
      2 tb Honey
      1 ts Lemon juice; preferably
           -fresh
 
  For the dough, combine the matzo meal, cake meal, 1/2 cup sugar,
  ground almonds, cinnamon, and cloves in a medium-sized bowl. Add the
  oil, egg, and 3/4 cup water, and mix very well for form a stiff
  dough. Knead the dough with your hands a few times to complete the
  mixing. Evenly press the dough into a greased 8-inch-square baking
  pan. Use a knife to cut the dough into diamonds.  First, cut the
  dough crosswise into about 4 even rows. Then make diagonal, parallel
  cuts through the rows. (If desired, cut the dough into squares,
  instead.)  Press a whole almond into the center of each piece. Bake
  the cake in a preheated 375-degree oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or
  until it is browned and firm.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the syrup.  Put the sugar and water into a small
  saucepan.  Stir over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves and
  the syrup comes to a boil; then boil the syrup, uncovered and
  undisturbed, for 8 minutes.  Stir in the honey and lemon juice.
  Remove the syrup from the heat, and set it aside to cool slightly.
  
  When the cake has finished baking, remove it from the oven, and recut
  the pieces.  Pour the syrup evenly over the hot cake. Let the cake
  rest for several hours to completely absorb the syrup. After the
  syrup has been absorbed, cover the cake with aluminum foil or plastic
  wrap and store it at room temperature. Makes about 16 pieces. Source:
  The Jewish Holiday Cookbook by Gloria Kaufer Greene.
  
  Note:  This is a passover version of a cake popular with Turkish and
  Greek Jews throughout the year.  The cake is soaked in a sugar-honey
  syrup after it is baked. For best flavor and texture, tishpishti
  should be made at least one day ahead.  It will stay well for several
  days.

      Title: CAKE DOUGHNUTS (CROCKER)
 Categories: Breads, Crocker
      Yield: 24 Doughnuts
 
           Vegetable oil
  3 1/3 c  All-purpose flour*
      1 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Milk
      2 tb Shortening
      3 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
      2    Eggs
 
  Heat oil (2 to 3 inches) in deep fryer or Dutch oven to 375F Beat 1.5
  cups of the flour and the remaining ingredients in 1.5-quart bowl on
  low speed, scraping bowl constantly, 30 seconds. Beat on medium
  speed, scraping bowl occasionally, 2 minutes. Stir in remaining flour.
  
  Turn the dough onto generously floured cloth-covered board; roll
  around lightly to coat with flour. Gently roll 3/8 inch thick Cut
  with floured doughnut cutter. Slide doughnuts into hot oil with wide
  spatula. Turn doughnuts as they rise to surface. Fry until golden
  brown, 1 to 1.5 minutes on each side. Remove carefully from oil (do
  not prick surfaces); drain. Serve plain or shake one at a time in a
  bag with powdered sugar. 2 dozen doughnuts;150 calories per doughnut.
  
  *If using self rising flour; omit babng powder and salt.
  
  Buttermilk Doughnuts: Do not use self rising flour. Substitute
  buttermilk for the milk. Decrease baking powder to 2 ts and beat in 1
  ts baking soda.
  
  NOTE: Hot fat cools somewhat when foods are dropped into it. While
  foods are frying, temperature of fat should be 370F to 380F. If fat
  is too hot, foods brown before they are cooked through; if too cool,
  foods become grease-soaked. A deep-fat thermometer is a good
  investment; checking it helps maintain a constant temperature. Do not
  use a candy thermometer for deep-fat fiying as it does not register
  high enough.

      Title: CALABRIAN ASPARAGUS SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Clove garlic - minced
      2 tb Olive oil - extra-virgin
      2 lb Asparagus - trimmed and cut
           -into 1-inch pieces
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
      4 c  Vegetable Broth - (see
           -recipe) OR canned low-
           Sodium chicken broth
      4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Parmesan - fresly grated OR
           -Pecorino, PLUS extra
           For serving
      6 sl Italian bread - toasted
 
  Number of Servings:   6
  
  1.  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over
  moderate heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes.
  Add the asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add
  the salt, pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the
  heat to moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender,
  about 15 minutes.
  
  2.  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce
  the heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very
  slowly ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs,
  whisking constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg
  mixture into the soup in the saucepan.  Increase the heat to
  moderately low and cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just
  thickens, about 8 minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs
  will curdle. Remove from the heat.
  
  3.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the
  hot soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian
  cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from
  day-old or slightly stale bread. Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.

      Title: CALAMARI FARCITI CON RICOTTA E SPINACI
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 lg Squid
      1 md Onion; minced
      1    Garlic clove; minced
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Butter, unsalted
    1/2 lb Spinach, fresh; trimmed
    2/3 lb Ricotta
      1    Egg
      1 tb Parsley, Italian; chopped
           Kosher salt; to taste
           Pepper, black; to taste
    1/2 c  Wine, white, dry
      2 c  Tomato, plum
      1    Lemon; quartered
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Clean the squid and chop the
  tentacles finely.  Set them aside. Saut 82 the onion and the garlic
  in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter until the onion is
  soft. Add the tentacles and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the spinach and
  saut E9, stirring, until it has wilted. Drain off any extra liquid
  and cool the spinach. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, egg,
  parsley, and the cooled spinach mixture. Mix thoroughly and season
  with salt, pepper, and hot pepper flakes. Stuff the mixture loosely
  into the squid and close the openings securely with a toothpick. Use
  the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rectangular baking
  dish large enough to hold the squid comfortably in one layer. Arrange
  the squid in the dish and add the wine and tomatoes. Season with
  salt, pepper and more hot pepper flakes, if you wish. Bake for 40 to
  45 minutes, or until the squid is tender and the sauce has thickened.
  If there is too much sauce, raise the oven temperature and allow the
  liquid to reduce.  If there is too little, add more white wine. Serve
  the squid with lemon quarters. Do not overstuff the squid or they may
  split while they cook.  Rice and braised fennel go well with this
  dish.

      Title: CALAMARIA GEMISTA (STUFFED SQUID)
 Categories: Seafood, Greek
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Large fresh squid
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 c  Coarsely chopped onion
           -(packed)
    1/3 c  Long-grain rice
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
      2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped
    1/4 c  Currants
    3/4 c  Dry white or red wine
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
           -to taste
    3/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
           -(packed)
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill, packed
      4 tb Chopped fresh mint
      2 c  Peeled, seeded tomatoes
           -(chopped)
 
  Wash and clean squid.  Grasp the head just below the eyes, pull it
  off from the rest of the body, and set it aside. Cut away the thin
  purplish membrane on the outside of the tail section. Using your
  index finger, scoop out and discard the guts and thin cartilage
  "icicle" on the inside of the tail section.  Rinse tail sections
  inside and out and set aside in a colander to drain.  Take the head
  section in one hand and put pressure with your thumb and forefinger
  around the mouth and eyes, to squeeze them out. Discard mouth and
  eyes.
  
  Chop the squid tentacles and have them ready, as they will be used in
  the stuffing.
  
  In a large skillet, heat half the oilve oil and saute onion until
  wilted. Add rice, tentacles, and pine nuts and saute over medium-low
  heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and currants to rice and stir
  quickly with a woodent spoon.  Pour in 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup
  water. Season with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to low and simmer,
  covered, until liquid is almost completely absorbed and rice is soft
  but only about half cooked, about 15 minutes.  About 5 minutes before
  removing skillet from heat, add parsley, dill and mint. Remove and
  let cool enough to handle.
  
  Using a small teaspoon or a butter knife, carefully fill about three
  quarters of each squid with the rice mixture. Use toothpicks to secure
  closed.  Pour remaining olive oil into a large stewing pot. Place
  squid carefully in pot.  Pour in remaining wine and enough water to
  cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered for
  about 1-1/2 hours, or until rice is cooked and squid fork-tender.
  Twenty minutes before removing squid from heat, add chopped tomatoes
  to pot and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Check throughout
  cooking to see if more water is necessary so that mixture doesn't dry
  out.  Serve squid hot or cold with a simple green salad.
  
  SERVING SUGGESTIONS: This dish needs a delicate wine such as a Robola
  Callinga or Santorini Boutari.  Serve with wild greens (horta),
  'horiatiki salata (village salad), and a beautiful olive bread.

  Select squid with hoods about 10-12 cm (4-5 inches) long.
  
  To clean squid, pull off head and attached tentacles. Cut out eyes
  and beak and discard.  Clean dark skin from head and tentacles by
  pulling it off or rubbing off with a cloth dipped in coarse salt.
  Rinse, chop 3 to 4 into small pieces and keep aside.  Remainder may
  be stored and fried later.
  
  Clean out hood (body) and remove transparent backbone from inside.
  Pull or rub off skin.  Rinse well, drain and dry.
  
  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan and gently fry onion until
  transparent. Stir in rice and stir over heat for 2 minutes. Add
  tomato puree, water, cinnamon stick, cloves, chopped squid, and salt
  and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes or
  until liquid is absorbed. Remove cinnamon stick and cloves.
  
  Fill hoods with rice mixture, packing it in loosely as rice expands
  and hoods contract during cooking.  Close top with wooden cocktail
  picks or sew with strong thread.
  
  Heat remaining oil in a deep pan and fry squid hoods until lightly
  coloured, turning them frequently. Reduce heat, add wine, cover and
  simmer gently on low heat for 1 hour or until squid is tender. Add a
  little water to pan if necessary during cooking. Serve hot or warm as
  a mezethaki (appetizer).

  Tofu [or soybean curd] is an excellent source of protein. The
  equivalent of cottage cheese, it is made by curdling fresh, hot soy
  milk with a coagulant such as calcium sulphate, a naturally occurring
  mineral. It is the tofu's reaction with calcium sulphate that makes
  it an excellent calcium source.
  
  Slice tofu into 1/2-inch thick slices; place in glass baking dish.
  
  Whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, horseradish, vinegar
  and garlic; pour over tofu, turning to coat well. Cover and

  The editors wrote: "The Italians do not have a corner on tomato
  sauce. We received recipes for ones of Indian, Mexican, Caribbean and
  other ethnic persuasions - many quite complex and intriguing. Except
  perhaps for the garam masala (for which you could substitute
  commercial curry powder), this exotic dish could come right from your
  local supermarket."

      3 tb Distilled white vinegar
  1 1/4 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      4 tb Olive oil
      3    Whole dried hot red chiles
      5    Garlic cloves, peeled and
           -minced
      1 lg Onion, peeled and minced
      1 ts Whole black peppercorns
      1    Two-inch cinnamon stick
      2    Bay leaves
      4 ts Tomato paste
      2 md Potatoes
    1/2 lg Red bell pepper
      8    Whole stuffed green olives
 
  Put the cubed meat into a bowl and add the vinegar, salt and pepper.
  Set aside for 30 to 40 minutes. Drain the meat, saving the liquid,
  and pat it dry.
  
  In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. When it is
  hot, add the chiles. Stir for a few seconds or until they swell and
  darken. Remove chiles with a slotted spoon and set aside. Put as many
  cubes of meat into the pan as will fit without crowding.
  
  Brown the meat on all sides and repeat until all of the meat is
  browned. Remove meat from pan.
  
  Put the onion and garlic into the pan and cook for 2 minutes,
  scraping up any pan juices. Put in the black peppercorns, cinnamon
  and bay leaves. Stir and cook another minute. Return the meat to the
  pan with its accumulated juices, the chiles, the reserved marinade
  and the tomato paste. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Add 2 cups water
  and bring to a boil. Cover, turn the heat to low and cook for 15
  minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into 1 1/2-inch cubes. When
  the meat has cooked for 15 minutes, add the potatoes. Cover and
  continue to cook for 45-60 minutes or until the meat is tender. Seed
  the bell pepper and cut it into 1/4-inch wide strips. When the meat
  is tender, put the peppers and olives into the stew. Stir and cook
  another 3-5 minutes.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken; cut up and browned
      3 tb Olive oil
      4    Garlic clove; sliced
      3    Onion; peeled and chopped
      1 ts Cumin seeds, whole

           -and chopped
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 c  Red wine
           Salt
 
  Brown the chicken. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Saute the
  garlic, onions, cumin seeds and jalapeno peppers until the onions are
  clear. Add all to a heavy pot and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1 hour.
  This one has to be different. If it came from California it is
  expected to be unusual. Try this. No avocado, but chicken and a very
  mild chili sauce from a jar. It is really a great dish, although one
  should not confuse it with the old-line chili cookers' product. By

      Title: CALIFORNIA DIP BREAD (ABM)*
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      1 pk Yeast
  3 1/3 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1    Egg
    3/4 c  Cottage cheese
    3/4 c  Sour cream
      3 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Water
      1    Envelope Lipton's Onion
 
  Slightly warm the next 6 ingredients and pour into pan. Select white
  bread and push 'start'.
  
  NOTE:  I have made this recipe manually, and it's fabulous. I used an
  entire envelope of Lipton's Recipe Secrets (Onion), and did the
  following:
  
  Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 warm water in the bottom of large mixing
  bowl. Add the butter, egg, sour cream, and cottage cheese (all
  slightly warmed) and mix well. Stir in the soup mix and the sugar,
  and lastly the baking soda, mixing all well.  Add the flour about 1
  cup at a time, mixing thoroughly - after last addition, start using
  you hands to mix and knead. Knead well (about 10-15 minutes) until
  dough is elastic (my dough was too sticky and I ended up adding a
  little additional flour). Let rise until double (about 1 1/2 hours)
  in a lightly greased bowl (<-- important! I didn't grease the bowl
  and it got sticky on the bottom); punch down and knead lightly. Place
  dough in greased baking container of choice, and let rise again until
  double again (about another 45 minutes). Bake at 350 degrees for
  40-45 minutes, or until cake tester comes out clean. Remove from pan
  immediately and cool completely on cooling rack. This recipe made
  enough for 1 loaf in my breadcrock (about 3/4 of the dough), and the
  remaining 1/4 made 2 mini-loaves. The mini-loaves, however, only bake
  about 15 minutes or so.  Would probably produce two regular-sized
  loaf pans of bread. Would be excellent with deli meats or used
  grilled for other sandwiches! The mini-loaves or a decorative tube
  pan would turn it into wonderful cocktail bread.  Tastes like a very
  moist, slightly sweet double-onion bagel.  I am anxious to use this
  same recipe and experiment with other soup mixes!!

  Now for the variables, I have made this with no apricots but with one
  fresh apple, chopped ( not peeled). I have made this with and without
  raisins. Less sweet but good both ways. I am eager to try it with
  fresh bluberries in place of the apricots. I have also made it
  without the pineapple because I forgot to buy some, instead I used 1
  cup apple juice. If you don't have the soy flour or the dry milk,
  just add the equivilent of flour or oat bran or??

  1 1/4 c  Boiling water
           ...
      2 tb Powdered milk

  Combine soup and water in your bread machine's pan and let sit 15
  minutes. Add the remaining ingredients in the order listed. Fire it
  up on the "BREAD" setting. Let it cool completely, preferably
  overnight to develop the onion flavor.  Toasting will also sharpen
  the onion flavor.
  
  To suit your own taste, you can vary the flour in any combination
  equaling 3 cups.  Remember that 100% whole wheat will make a shorter
  loaf.

    2/3 c  Whole milk
    1/2 ts Seasoning salt
    1/3 c  Dry white wine
    1/8 ts White pepper
      2 c  Monterey Jack cheese;
           -shredded and divided
 
  Cook noodles according to package directions and set aside. In a large
  skillet, saute mushrooms, green and red peppers, and green onions in 2
  tablespoons of butter. Cook for 5 minutes, add garlic and stir. Remove
  vegetables from pan and set aside.  In the same pan, melt the
  remaining butter over medium heat, blend in flour, then gradually
  pour in milk. Stir until smooth and thickened. Blend in seasoning
  salt, wine, white pepper, and 1 cup of the shredded cheese. Cook and
  stir until cheese melts. To the sauce, add the noodles and
  vegetables. Pour all into a 1-1/2-quart casserole and top with
  remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes
  until bubbly.
  
  Note:  This sauce can be made ahead of time, covered, and
  refrigerated. Let stand for 20 minutes or so at room temperature
  before baking. You might need a little more butter, I had to use more
  than stated in the ingredients; you may get by with the amount listed.

    1/2    Medium-size onion, chopped
    3/4 c  Tomato juice, OR 1/2 cup
           -tomato sauce thinned with 2
           Tbsp water
      1 sm Clove garlic, minced
      3    Whole chiles, parched,
           -peeled and chopped, OR 4 oz
           Canned whole green chiles,
           -chopped
    3/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Ground Mexican oregano
    1/2 ts Salt
      4    Corn tortillas
      4    To 8 eggs
      2    Avocados, peeled and thinly
           -sliced lengthwise
    1/2 c  Grated Monterey Jack or
           -Cheddar cheese
      4    Lettuce leaves, coarsely
           -chopped
 
  ...Serve fresh fruit, warm wheat-flour tortillas, sweet butter, honey
  and coffee for a great brunch.
  
  1.  In a medium-size saucepan, heat the oil, add the chopped onion,
  and fry over medium heat until the onion is translucent. Add tomato
  juice, garlic, chiles, herbs, and salt.  Reduce heat to simmer for
  about 10 minutes. Sauce can be made a day or hours ahead of time and
  left at this point.
  
  2.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Warm the tortillas by wrapping in
  foil and placing on the 4 serving plates (Mexican pottery if
  possible) in the warm oven. At the same time, warm the extra
  tortillas you are serving as bread.
  
  3.  Poach the eggs, using an egg poacher or a frying pan of hot water
  with 2 tablespoons vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt added. First break an
  egg into a cup, then stir the water in the frying pan vigorously in a
  circular motion. As you stir, slide the egg from the cup into the
  water. Cover the pan when all eggs have been added.
  
  4.  To assemble the dish, place a tortilla on a plate. Top with a
  circle of avocado slices, then arrange a drained poached egg (or 2
  eggs) on top, spoon sauce over, and sprinkle with cheese. Place in
  the oven until cheese melts.  Add the lettuce garnish after the
  cheese has melted.
  
  Variation: Instead of the tortillas, rinse large "cupped" iceberg
  lettuce leaves and serve the eggs topped with sauce in the lettuce
  leaves.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: CALLOS A LA MADRILENA
 Categories: Spanish, Snacks
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb "honeycomb" tripe
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      1 sm Tomato, chopped
      1    Pig's foot or veal knuckle,
           -split in half
      2    Sprigs parsley
     10    Peppercorns, lightly crushed
      2    Cloves, crushed
      1 ds Of nutmeg
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 ts Dried thyme, or equivalent
           -amount of fresh
           Salt
      1 sm Onion, coarsely chopped
      6    Cloves garlic, peeled
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
    1/4 lb Chorizo (or Italian
           -sausage), in 1/4-inch
           -slices
    1/4 c  Diced cured (unsmoked) ham
      1 tb Flour
      1 tb Sweet red (Spanish) paprika
    1/2    Dried red chili pepper,
           -crumbled (remove seeds if
           -you wish)
 
  (Tripe, Madrid Style)
  
  Tripe is especially favored in Spain and, in fact, most countries
  where there is still a strong Spanish influence. This isn't
  surprising, because it makes a number of very different, but
  extremely tasty dishes. It requires long cooking times (less here
  because it is almost always cleaned and partially precooked when you
  buy it), but it keeps very well for days, in the refrigerator, and is
  even better when reheated than when first prepared.  Since it's
  difficult to buy half a pig's foot or half a veal knuckle, this
  recipe makes enough for 4 - 6 servings as a main course. Make a full
  recipe a day or two ahead of time, serve as many tapas as needed,
  then enjoy the rest as a main course or snacks. This can be reheated
  very nicely in the microwave, by the way.
  
  To serve 4 - 6 as a main course, or make 12 - 18 tapas:
  
  Rinse the tripe well, then put it into a rather large kettle and add
  cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil, then drain immediately. Cut
  the tripe into 1 1/2-inch squares and return it to the empty kettle.
  Add 3 cups cold water and the wine, tomato, pig's foot or veal
  knuckle, parsley, peppercorns, cloves, nutmeg, bay leaves, thyme,
  salt to taste, coarsely chopped onion and the garlic. Cover and
  simmer over low heat for 4 to 5 hours, until the tripe is almost
  tender.
  
  Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the finely chopped onion until it
  is wilted.  Add the chorizo and ham and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in
  the flour and paprika and cook 1 minute more. Add 1/2 cup of the
  liquid from the tripe kettle, a little at a time, and cook-stir until
  the mixture thickens.
  
  Add this and the chile to the tripe.  Cover and cook 1 ~ 2 hours more.
  Remove the cover and continue cooking until the tripe is very tender.
  
  Remove the pig's foot or veal knuckle from the tripe. Remove and
  discard all skin, bone and fat.  Cut the meat into pieces and stir
  into the tripe.
  
  Serve in warmed bowls or shallow individual tapa-size dishes. Serve
  with good crusty bread for sopping up the sauce.

      Title: CALZONE WITH SUN-DRIED TOMATOES
 Categories: Italian, Pizza
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Deep-Dish Pizza Dough
      1 tb Oil from sun-dried tomatoes
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      1    Clove garlic, minced
           Or pressed
      1 c  (8 oz) ricotta cheese
    1/4 c  Chopped sun-dried tomatoes
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 lb Sliced prosciutto or dry
           Salami, cut into strips
      2 c  (1/2 lb) shredded whole-
           Milk mozzarella cheese
           Cornmeal (for baking sheet)
           Olive oil
 
  1. Prepare Deep-Dish Pizza Dough and let it rise.
  
  2. While dough rises, prepare filling. In a medium frying pan heat
  tomato oil over moderate heat; add onion and cook, stirring often,
  until soft but not browned. Mix in garlic, then remove from heat.
  
  3. In a medium bowl mix ricotta cheese with dried tomatoes and
  parsley; stir in cooked onion mixture.
  
  4. Divide dough into two equal portions. Roll each half out on a
  floured suface to a 12-inch circle. Spread half of the ricotta
  filling over half of each circle of dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch
  margin.
  
  5. Sprinkle half of each circle with half of the prosciutto strips
  and 1 cup of the mozarella cheese. Fold circles in halves over
  filling, moistening and pinching edges together (or pressing with
  tines of a fork) to seal.
  
  6. Preheat oven to 450~ F. Sprinkle a large, greased baking sheet
  lightly with cornmeal. Place calzone well apart on prepared baking
  sheet. Let rise until puffy (12 to 15 minutes). Brush tops lightly
  with olive oil, then serve hot.

      Title: CALZONES
 Categories: Vegetarian, Ethnic, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------DOUGH MIXTURE----------------------------
      1 c  Warm water
      2 ts Yeast
      2 tb Oil
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Sucanat
  1 1/4 c  Whole wheat flour or 1 c.
           -spelt flour
  1 1/4 c  Unbleached flour

MMMMM----------------------FILLING MIXTURE---------------------------
    1/2 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onion (1 sm. onion)
      2 c  Chopped mushrooms (about
           -1/2 pound)
    1/2 c  Chopped celery
    1/2 c  Chopped tomatoes
    1/2 c  Sliced black olives
      1 ts Basil
      1 ts Oregano
      2 tb Tomato paste
      2 c  Crumbled firm tofu (1 12-oz.
           -package, drained)
      2 tb Nutritional yeast
      1 tb Arrowroot
      3 tb Salsa (optional)
           Salt and pepper to taste

MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
 
  Dissolve yeast in warm water (about 105 degrees or just warm to
  touch). Let sit for about 5 minutes or untilyeast starts coming to
  the top of the water. Add the oil, salt and Sucanat and mix well. Add
  the whole whet flour and mix with wooden spoon, scraping the sides of
  the bowl often. Stir for about 150 strokes (the gluten strands will
  be forming). Add the rest of the flour except fo the last 1/4 cup.
  Stir vigorously. If the dough seems stiff enough to handle, don't add
  the rest of the flour; if not, stir in the rest of the flour. Turn
  dough out onto a floured board and knead for about 5 minutes. Try not
  to add extra flour as the more flour you add the drier the final
  product will be. Oil or wet your hands so dough doesn't stick to your
  hands while kneading. Place dough into a clean bowl, cover with a
  piece of plastic wrap (so dough won't stick to it, should it rise and
  it it) and set in a warm place to rise for about an hour.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the filling; heat a heavy skillet over a medium
  heat. Add the onions, stir and reduce heat.Cover with a lid directly
  over the onions, to let the onions "sweat." When onions are
  transparent, add mushrooms, celery, tomatoes, olives, basil, oregano,
  and tomato paste. Mix well and continue to cook for aout 5 minutes.
  Add the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, arrowroot, salsa (if
  desired) and salt to taste. Stir and simmer for about 15 minutes. If
  the dough mixture isn't quite ready yet, let mixture cool for a bit.
  
  When dough is doubled in bulk (or nearly doubled--don't let it rise
  too long), punch it down and turn it out onto a floured counter
  again. Divide it into 6 equal, or nearly-equal portions. Roll each
  portion into a circle (or pat it into a circle) about 1/4 inch thick.
  For each portion, use 1/6 of the filling, palcing the filling over
  1/2 of the circle. Try to leave a 1/2-inch rim around the outside.
  Fould dough over, stretching, if necessary. Press down around the
  outside with a fork, dipped in water so it doesn't stick.
  
  Place on an oiled baking sheet and lightly brush with oil over the
  tops. Make a few incisions with a knife on each calzone.Bake in a
  preheated 450-degree oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown.
  It is okay to bake in two batches if you have a small oven.
  
  Serves 6 or 3 calzone-crazed people.

      1    Egg; slightly beaten
    3/4 ts Garlic salt
    1/4 ts Pepper

      2 c  Prepared spaghetti sauce
           Grated Parmesan cheese
           Garlic bread sticks
           -- (optional)
 
  1. In medium bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, 1/4 cup
  water, garlic salt and pepper, mixing lightly but thoroughly. Shape
  into 24 (approx 1-1/4 inch) meatballs.
  
  2. Cut four 18x12 inch long sheets heavy duty aluminum foil. Place
  equal amounts of meatballs and zucchini in center of each; top each
  with 1/3 cup spaghetti sauce. Bring shorter edges of foil together
  over the center; fold down loosely to seal, allowing room for heat
  expansion and circulation. Fold in open ends to seal.
  
  3. Place packets on grid over medium ash-covered coals, Grill,
  uncovered, 16 to 18 minutes or until meatball centers are no longer
  pink and zucchini is tender, truning packets over once.
  
  4. To serve, carefully unfold ends and tops of packets; sprinkle
  cheese over meatballs. Serve with garlic bread sticks, dipping into
  sauce, if desired.
  
  Cooks tip: To check the temperature of the coals, cautiously hold
  your hand palm side down, at cooking height (just above the grid).
  Count the number of seconds you can hold your hand in that position
  before the heat is uncomfortable and you have to pull it away; 4
  seconds for medium coals.

  tempted to add liquid.If it will not hold to-gether its because the
  shortening and butter were not sufficiently well creamed. Divide into
  two portions and roll half to 1/4 in. thickness and spread out on
  bottom of a greased pan. Cover with following date mixture: 1/2 cup
  of dates chopped, 1/2 cup brown sugar, one tblsp. cornstarch, 1 cup

      Title: CANDIED GRAPEFRUIT
 Categories: Fruits/nuts, Desserts, Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Plump, pink grapefruit,
           - preferably organic
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Corn syrup
           Superfine sugar; for coating
      5 oz Semisweet chocolate
      1 tb Butter
 
  SCORE GRAPEFRUIT INTO QUARTERS and carefully pull off peels or juice
  fruits and cut halves again in half. Place peels in large pan, cover
  them with cold water and bring to boil. Simmer 25 minutes. Remove
  peels and let them cool until they are easy to handle. Hold peels
  firmly against counter and gently scrape away most of white pith just
  below skin. Cut cleaned peels into strips with knife or scissors as
  narrow or wide as you like. In 2-quart saucepan, mix together sugar,
  water and corn syrup. Bring to boil. When syrup is clear, add peels,
  lower heat and cook slowly until peels are translucent, about 1 hour.
  Set cake rack over baking sheet. Remove peels a few at a time and
  spread them out on rack to drain about 15 minutes. While they are
  draining, thickly cover large plate with super- fine sugar. Set
  several pieces at a time in sugar and turn them to coat them. When
  evenly coated, set them aside on another plate or piece of parchment
  paper thinly coated with sugar. This process will need to be done in
  several batches. If sugar become lumpy with beads of syrup, pass it
  through a strainer, then continue using it. Set aside sugared peels
  about 1 hour or until they are dried. Carefully package them in tin
  or plastic container and store either in cupboard or refrigerator. To
  dip peels in chocolate, melt semisweet chocolate over simmering water
  along with butter. Stir well to ensure that mixture is smooth before
  removing from heat. Dip each rind into chocolate, coating most of it
  but leaving a little "handle" to grasp. Or, completely immerse each
  rind in chocolate, then remove with 2 forks or pair of chopsticks.
  Set slices on parchment paper or cake rack and place in cool place to
  harden. Once chocolate has set, pieces can be stored in refrigerator.
  Chocolate will discolor when it cools but will become dark and glossy
  again once brought to room temperature. Makes 3 Cups

  Froth up the egg whites with a little water. With a small brush,
  paint the leaves with the egg white and dust both sides with the
  powdered sugar. Set each leaf on a sheet of wax paper and allow to
  dry. They will dry with a frosty crystalized coating and make a nice

      8    Oranges
           Water
      1 c  Boiling water
      4 c  Sugar
 
  Makes about 3-4 lbs of candy.
  
  (TIP):   Collect  the  orange  halves over a period of time and
  refrigerate them in a plastic bag until you have enough to prepare
  candied peel. You may candy *whole* orange halves, if you wish.
   Just boile them without cutting them into strips. When cooled, they
  make lovely containers for candies and nuts, or holiday desserts.
  
  Wash the oranges.  Cut into halves and squeeze out the juice. Use the
  juice for some other purpose,  of course. Place the oranges into a
  large saucepan and cover with cold water.
  
  Place over high heat and heat to a boil.   Add cold water to cover
  again. Heat to a boil and drain.
   Repeat this process five times in all. Drain well and scoop out the
  pulp. Cut the oranges into 1/4 inch wide strips.
  
  Combine  1 cup of boiling water with 2 cups of the sugar. Heat until
  the sugar is dissolved.   Stir in the orange strips. Place over
  medium heat and boil for about 30  minutes,  until  all  the liquid
  is evaporated. Watch carefully so the peels don't scorch.
   Cool.   Roll the strips  in  the remaining 2 cups of sugar. Place on

  sugar is dissolved. Add gelatin & peels & simmer for 20 min. Remove
  from heat. On a sheet of waxed paper or microwave paper, sprinkle 1
  C. granulated sugar. Lightly roll the peels in the sugar, a few at a

  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      4 x  Egg yolks
      2 ts Vanilla
  4 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 tb Peppermint candy
           Red food colouring
 
  Cream together butter and sugar.  Add egg yolks and vanilla and mix
  well. Sift flour and salt together and beat into butter mixture until
  well mixed. When ready, divide dough in half.  To one half, add 1/2
  ts. red food colouring.  Using about a tablespoon of dough, roll a 4"
  strip of each colour (no fatter than a pencil). Place the two
  coloured rolls side-by-side and press lightly together.  Gently twist
  like a rope and place on an ungreased cookie sheet 1" apart. Curve
  the top like a candy cane and bake in a pre-heated oven at 350 F. for
  about 15 minutes; do not brown. Sprinkle with crushed peppermint
  candy before cool. Makes 20-30 medium cookies. Personal Note:  After
  trial and error, I found that it is easier to take each tablespoon of
  cookie dough and roll in hands to form rough cylinder. Then put on
  flat surface vertically. Using fingers and palm in same direction,
  gently roll left and right until the size of a pencil. (the dough,
  that is):)  Pick a time to do these cookies when you're feeling
  creative and have patience. It's fun and they are yummy! The end
  product is worth the trouble.

           No ingredients; see text
 
                          Stages of Syrup Cooking Slightly more cooking
  is required on damp or rainy days than on a dry , clear day.
  Allowance is made for this in the following table. The higher
  temperature should be used on a damp day while the lower is right for
  clear weather. Soft ball, for fondant, fudge, panocha_______________
  234F. to 238F. Firm ball, for caramels______________________________
  246F. to 248F. Hard ball, for taffy_________________________________
  265F. to 270F. Crack stage, for butterscotch________________________
  290F. to 300F. Hard crack, for brittles, sticks, lollypops__________
  300F. to 310F. Hard crack stage, for clear hard candies_____________
  to 310F.
                            Cold Water Test
      Pour about 1/2 teaspoon os the hot candy into a cup nearly full
  of very cold water. Shape the syrup with the fingers of one hand.
  Soft ball: The syrup can be formed into a soft ball which flatens on
  removal from the water. Firm ball: The syrup can be formed into a
  ball which offers some resistance to the fingers. Hard ball: The ball
  which is formed is distinctly chewy. Crack: The mixture sounds britle
  when struck against the side of the cup; it can be broken by crushing
  between the fingers. Hard crack: The brittle mixture will not stick
  to the teeth.
      If a thermometer is used, it should be tested in boiling water. It
  should register 212 F. If 214 F., cook candy 2 degrees higher, if 210
  F., cook candy 2 degrees lower. Make your adjustments accordingly.

      Title: CANDY MELT ROSES
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     14 oz Candy Melts - (1 package)
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
 
  Melt candy melts according to package directions.  Add heated light
  corn syrup and stir until thoroughly mixed. Let set at room
  temperature in an airtight plastic bag for at least 24 hours or up to
  one week. Candy becomes easier to work with as it sets.  When ready
  to use, knead a small amount until it reaches a workable consistency.
  
  MODELING A ROSE: Start with the base and mold a cone that's
  approximately 1-1/2 inch high from a 3/4-inch diameter ball of
  modeling candy. Next, make petals. Flatten 3/8-inch ball of modeling
  candy into a circle that's about 1/4-inch thick on one side and about
  the diameter of a dime. Make several petals this size. Wrap first
  petal around the point of the cone to form a bud.  Now press three
  more petals around the base of the bud. Gently pinch edges of petals.
  Make five more petals using slightly larger balls of modeling candy.
  Flatten, then thin edge with finger and cup petals. Press petals
  under first row of petals. Continue adding petals, placing them in
  between and slightly lower than previous row. For a fuller flower,
  continue adding petals in this manner.
  
  TO MAKE CANDY LEAVES: On the back of clean, thoroughly dried, grape
  or rose leaves, paint on melted Candy Melts with a soft pastry or
  decorator's brush. Pull out pointed or curved edges to resemble
  certain kinds of leaves. Let coating set and when completely dry,
  carefully peel off candy.

 Categories: Vietnam, Seafood
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     10    Crab legs or several hard
           -shell crabs
           Shrimp paste, prepared as
           -for Shrimp on Sugar Cane
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil

MMMMM-------------------------NUOC CHAM------------------------------
      1    Clove garlic
    1/2    Fresh hot red chili pepper
           -or 2 dried
      2 ts Heaping, granulated sugar
    1/8    Fresh lime
      2 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2 1/2 tb Water, more if necessary
 
  Here we have a party dish that will bring out "oohs" and "ahs" from
  your guests on sight - and a repeat performance on taste.
  
  Crab claws, alone, are sometimes available in fish stores. If they
  aren't, boil several hard shell crabs and use the claws; you can use
  the bodies in many other dishes.
  
  The crab claws in fish stores are already partially peeled and serve
  not only as a handle but are edible as well. If you prepare your own
  claws, peel the upper section around which you mold the shrimp paste.
  
  Boil the crab legs or crabs for about 10 minutes, then drain and cool;
  remove the claws from the crabs, if using, and reserve the bodies for
  another purpose.
  
  Have the shrimp paste ready; preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Pour the oil into a bowl.  Dip your fingers into the oil and pick up 2
  tablespoons of the shrimp paste. Mold it into an oval around and
  halfway down the crab claw, covering the part of the claw where it
  was attached to the body; this will leave a claw tip extended to
  serve as a handle. Place the claws on a baking sheet and bake in the
  preheated oven for 30 minutes.
  
  Serve with Nuoc Cham and watercress.
  
  NOTE:  In Vietnam, this dish is always barbecued over charcoal. If
  you wish to prepare it this way, cook for 10 minutes on each side.
  
  Makes 10 servings.

  NUOC CHAM:
  
  This exciting sauce is almost always served at Vietnamese meals, just
  a Westerners serve salt and pepper. It's base is nuoc mam (bottled
  fish sauce). Freshly prepared, it is a constant delight, and so
  addictive to Western palettes that it will appear with meals other
  than Vietnamese. To best appreciate the results of its superb
  blending qualities at the table, use it sparingly at first, gradually
  adding more until the result is just right for your palate.
  
  Peel the garlic.  Split the chili pepper down the center and remove
  the seeds and membrane.  Cut into pieces and put into a mortar,
  together with the garlic and sugar. Pound into a paste. Squeeze the
  lime juice into the paste, then with a small knife remove the pulp
  from the lime section and add it as well. Mash this mixture and add
  the fish sauce and water.
  
  NOTE:  If you find this a trifle strong at first, dilute it with an
  additional 1/2 tablespoon of water.

      1 ds MSG (optional)
      2 tb Mixed chopped fresh
           -coriander (Chinese parsley)
           Scallion green
 
  An excellent way to get twice the pleasure out of your fish purchase.
  You can use either the fish head of the fish carcass if you wish. To
  the people of the South, this is as much their traditional dish as
  Southern Fried Chicken is to our southerners++and it will meet with
  instant praise
  
  Sprinkle the scallions, black pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and 4
  teaspoons fish sauce over the fish head.  Allow to stand for 10 to 15
  minutes.
  
  Bring 1 quart of water to a boil and drop in the sour bamboo and
  pineapple slices.  Cook at a lively boil for 5 minutes. Drop fish
  head into the actively boiling water and, keeping at a boil, add the
  2 tablespoons fish sauce, remaining teaspoon salt, and a dash of MSG.
  Boil the fish head for a total of 10 minutes. Transfer to a soup
  tureen, sprinkle on the coriander and scallion green, and serve.
  
  NOTE:  If the fish head is dropped into water that is not boiling, it
  will fall apart.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

 Categories: Vietnam, Soups/stews, Beef/veal
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass or
      1 tb Dried Lemon Grass
           Sprinkling of freshly
           -ground black pepper
      2 ts Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
      6 oz Fatty beef chuck, sliced
           -paper thin
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      2    Shallots or white part of 2
           -scallions, sliced
      3 c  Water
  1 1/2    Beef bouillon cubes
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Fresh coriander (Chinese
           -parsley), chopped
      2    Scallions, green part only,
           -chopped
 
  Here's a pretty simple Vietnamese beef soup recipe in contrast to the
  recipe for Hanoi Beef Soup.  It doesn't call for hot chilies, but you
  can slice a couple into thin rounds and toss 'em in. That's kosher
  (if that term can apply...) with any Vietnamese soup. Add 'em either
  when the soup is brought to it's final boil or just after it's
  removed from the heat.
  
  If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and
  upper two-thirds of the stalk, then chop. If you are using dried, it
  must be soaked for 2 hours, then drained and chopped fine.
  
  Sprinkle the black pepper, 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce, and chopped
  garlic over the meat; mix well and allow the meat to absorb the
  flavors for a few minutes.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the shallots over a high flame. Add the lemon
  grass and fry for about 1 minute, then add the meat. Cook until all
  traces of redness are gone. Add the water, bring to a boil, and add
  the beef bouillon cubes, remaining 1 teaspoon fish sauce, and salt.
  Immediately before serving, bring the soup to a boil. Pour into bowls
  and sprinkle with the chopped coriander and scallion.

      Title: CANNED APPLE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Preserves, Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Shortening
    1/2 ts Baking powder
  3 1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Baking soda
      4    Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Applesauce
      1 ts Cinnamon (ground)
  3 1/3 c  Flour
      1 ts Cloves (ground)
      1 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Pecans (chopped)
 
  Grease 8 WIDE-MOUTH pint canning jars with melted shortening. Use a
  brush and avoid getting grease on the jar rims. Cream shortening and
  sugar. Beat in eggs and applesauce. Sift together the dry ingredients
  and blend them into the applesauce mixture.  Add the raisins and nuts
  and divide the batter evenly between 8 widemouth pint jars. The jars
  will be more than half full.  Bake open jars about 60 minutes in an
  oven at 325 degrees. When done, quickly remove one hot jar at a time
  and clean its sealing edge. Immediately apply and firmly tighten a
  two-piece wide-mouth canning lid. The lid will form a vacuum seal as
  the jar cools. Jars of cooled bread may be stored on the pantry shelf
  with other canned foods or may be placed in a freezer.  The bread is
  safe to eat as long as jars remain vacuum sealed and free of mold
  growth.
  
  NOTE: The lady who contributed this recipe to the magazine noted that
  she had some of this cake that is one year old and is still
  delicious. I have personally made this and have several jars that are
  still good over 5 months later.  I plan to save one jar from my
  original batch and see how long it will keep. (Nancy)

      Title: CANNED CAKE HINTS
 Categories: Desserts, Canned
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  ELLIE COLLIN CMKD93F
 
  I have a few more recipes but no time to upload them right now, I'll
  do that later on this evening. BTW, ANY cake can be baked in canning
  jars. I usually try one jar first--you have to know how much volume
  each recipe will give you. I usually fill ONE jar 1/2 full then bake
  it to see how high it rises. You don't want the cake to come out of
  the top of the jar, only to within 1/4 to 1/2 inch from the lip of
  the jar. Once you've established how high the cake rises, you can go
  from there. The first time around is a bit tricky because you won't
  know how many jars you'll need. MOST of the recipes I've tried I end
  up using around 8. Sterilize as many jars as you think you'll need
  and go from there. Also, the baking times will vary--the moistness of
  each cake recipe will determine the time. Again, MOST of the recipes
  I've tried bake in 35-40 minutes. Start checking the cakes at 30
  minutes and go from there. YES, the cakes DO slide easily out of the
  jars IF you use the jars I listed. They're Ball Quilted Crystal
  Canning Jars (#14400-81400). They can be found at most grocery stores
  (at least here in California) next to the pectin and other canning
  supplies. Also, I've seen the 12 oz straight-sided (plain) jars (# ?)
  at Smart & Final. The plain jars work fine too but they're not as
  pretty and you have to make your own labels--the jars I use come with
  decorative labels. One IMPORTANT tip--get your jars NOW! Once
  summer's over with they're very hard to find. Also, when you can, ask
  for the jars back, they're NOT cheap. Most folks don't mind returning
  them though, they usually want refills! <G> Make sure your LIDS are
  new, the rings don't have to be As the jars do seal, the cakes are as
  moist as the day you put them into the jars--sometimes MORESO. There
  will be a little condensation on the lids and some in the jars so
  when you seal them it's trapped inside. Don't worry about getting the
  water off of the lids before placing them onto the jars, the added
  moisture doesn't hurt the cakes in the slightest. I'm trying to
  address every question that's been asked of me before, I HOPE I've
  done that. If I've missed anything or if anyone has any questions,
  don't hesitate to ask. These make WONDERFUL Christmas gifts and you
  can start NOW! Single friends really appreciate these because each
  jar makes enough for one or two people.

      Title: CANNED FOODS FOR SPECIAL DIETS
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  The cost of commercially canned special diet food often prompts
  interest in preparing these products at home. Some low-sugar and
  low-salt foods may be easily and safely canned at home. However the
  color, flavor and texture of these foods may be different than
  expected and be less acceptable.
  
  CANNING WITHOUT SUGAR
  
  In canning regular fruits without sugar, it is very important to
  select fully ripe but firm fruits of the best quality. Prepare these
  as described for hot-packs for each fruit, but use water or regular
  unsweetened fruit juices instead of sugar syrup. (For more
  information see additional publications for individual fruits.) Juice
  made from the fruit being canned is best. Blends of unsweetened
  apple, pineapple, and white grape juice are also good for filling
  over solid fruit pieces. Adjust headspaces and lids and use the
  processing recommendations given for regular fruits. Add sugar
  substitutes, if desired, when serving.
  
  CANNING WITHOUT SALT (REDUCED SODIUM)
  
  To can tomatoes, vegetables, meats, poultry, and seafood, follow the
  normal procedures for canning, but omit the salt. In these products,
  salt seasons the food but is not necessary to ensure its safety. Add
  salt substitutes, if desired, when serving.

  You may prepare any chunk-style or pureed fruit with or without sugar,
  using the procedure for preparing each fruit. Pack in half-pint,
  preferably, or pint jars and refer to the processing times in Table 1.
  
  Caution: Do not attempt to can vegetables, red meats, or poultry
  meats, because proper processing times for pureed foods have not been
  determined for home use. Instead, can and store these foods using the
  standard processing procedures; puree or blend them at serving time.
  Heat the blended foods to boiling, simmer for 10 minutes, cool, and
  serve. Store unused portions in the refrigerator and use within 2
  days for best quality.

      Title: CANNOLI ALLA SICILIANA
 Categories: Desserts, Italian, Cheese
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Shells:
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Shortening
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Wine, Marsala, Burgundy or
           -Chablis
           Vegetable Oil
           Filling:
      3 c  Ricotta
    1/2 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/4 c  Cinnamon
    1/2    Square unsweetened
           Chocolate grated OR
    1/2 tb Cocoa (both optional)
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      3 tb Citron peel, chopped
      3 tb Orange peel, candied,chopped
      6    Glace cherries, cut up
 
  To make cannoli shells it is necessary to have 3 or 4 metal tubes,
  preferably made from very light tin, about 7-inches long and 1 1/8
  inches in diameter.  The edges should not be soldered. (Old aluminum
  chairs cut up work great)
  
  SHELLS: Combine flour, shortening, sugar and salt, and wetting
  gradually with wine, knead together with fingers until rather hard
  dough or paste is formed. Form into ball, cover with cloth and let
  stand about 1 hour. Cut dough in half and roll half of dough into a
  thin sheet about 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into 4 inch squares. Place a
  metal tube diagonally across each square from one point to another,
  wrapping dough around tube by overlapping the two points and sealing
  overlapping points with a little egg white. Meanwhile heat vegetable
  oil in large deep pan for deep frying. Drop one or two tubes at a
  time into hot oil. Fry gently until dough is a golden brown color.
  Remove from pan, let cool and gently remove shell from metal tube.
  Set shells aside to cool.   Repeat procedure until all shells are
  made.
  
  FILLING: Mix ricotta thoroughly with sifted dry ingredients. Add
  vanilla and fruit peel.  Mix and blend well. (A little grated
  pistachio may be added if desired). Chillin refrigerator before
  filling shells. Fill cold cannoli shells; smooth filling evenly at
  each end of shell. Decorate each end with a piece of glace cherry and
  sprinkle shells with confectioners sugar. Refrigerate until ready to
  serve.
  
  These are best if they are filled just before you company arrives.

           ****DOUGH****
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
      5 tb Marsala; (or use any other

           -cut in 5-inch lengths if
           -commercial forms are not
           -found)
           Fat for deep frying
           ****FILLING****
      2 c  Ricotta cheese; as fresh
           -as possible
    1/2 c  Superfine sugar
    1/4 c  Candied fruit; citron,
           -orange peel, etc., finely
           -diced
    1/4 c  Pistachio nuts; coarsely
           -chopped
    1/4 c  Semi-sweet chocolate; cut in
           -fine dice (optional)
      1 ts Vanilla extract OR
           Orange flower water;
           -optional
 
  Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the center, and
  add the wine and sugar.  Work the flour into the center until you
  have a rather firm dough, something like noodle dough. If the dough
  is too crumbly add more wine, but do not let it become sticky. Place
  dough on a lightly floured pastry cloth or board and knead it and
  pound it vigorously for about 15 minutes.  It should be perfectly
  smooth by then. Form it into a ball, wrap in a clean, slightly
  dampened cloth, and let it rest for 2 hours.  When it has rested,
  roll it out on the pastry cloth or board until very thin (no more
  than 1/16 inch). Cut it into 5-inch squares and roll it around the
  metal tubes as follows: take a square and place it before you diamond
  fashion; one of the points toward you. Place the tube vertically
  across the middle of the diamond, each end at a point of the dough.
  Fold the sides over the tube, moistening the overlap with a little
  water and pressing together.  When all the squares have been thus
  rolled, place them, a few at a time, into deep fat preheated to 375
  degrees F. Remove them when they are golden brown (tongs are best for
  this, as the rolls are fragile) and let them drain on absorbent
  paper. When they are cool, slip off the tubes, and fill with the
  ricotta filling.
  
  Press the ricotta through a fine sieve into a bowl. Beat it until it
  is creamy and smooth.  Beat in the rest of the ingredients with a
  large fork. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tube (or
  merely use the nozzle, without a tube) and pipe the filling into the
  cooled shells. Makes 12 cannoli.  Source: Great Italian Cooking by

      Title: CANTONESE BARBECUE PORK
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    To 3 1/2 pounds pork butt,
           -shoulder or tenderloin
      4 tb Soy sauce
      5 tb Sugar
      3 tb Honey
      2 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           -sherry
  1 1/2 ts Salt
           Mustard Dip (recipe follows)
      3 tb Toasted sesame seeds
 
  Think of these sweet, glazed strips of roast pork as the ham of Asia.
  Both Chinese and Southeast Asian cooks serve cha siu as a main dish,
  or as a meat addition or a delicious garnish in many stir-fry
  mixtures, soups, noodle dishes and fried rice.  Most Chinese cooks
  purchase their cha siu already prepared at a roasting shop
  (delicatessen). However, it is very easy to make at home, and the
  results are not as garishly red as some commercial versions made with
  food coloring.
  
  Remove and discard the excess fat from the pork.  Cut pork lengthwise
  (with the grain) into 2-inch wide strips 5 to 6 inches long. Put into
  a large bowl.
  
  Combine soy sauces, sugar, honey, hoisin, ginger, wine and salt. Pour
  over meat and rub it in well.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator
  at least overnight or for up to 3 days, turning several times.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Place the pork strips on a broiler pan lined with foil. Roast for 30
  minutes, turning once halfway through. Increase the heat to 425F and
  roast for 10 minutes longer. Let cool before slicing.
  
  To serve, cut across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices. Serve with
  mustard and sesame seeds for dipping.
  
  MUSTARD DIP:
  
  Mix together 2 tablespoons Colman's mustard, 2 tablespoons water,
  pinch of salt, pinch of sugar and a few drops of oil.

           ---------------------------
           -
           -CAPITOL LUNCH CHILI SAUCE
 
  1 lb. hamburger 4 green peppers (chopped) 4 onions (chopped) 3 celery
  stalks (chopped) 3 pcs. chopped garlic
  
  Mix hamburger and chopped ingredients in a saucepan. Add app. 3 cups
  of water.  Cook slowly until mixture begins to thicken.
  
  When  it thickens, add 3 tablespoons of chili powder, then add salt
  and pepper to suit your taste.
  
  The  secret of this sauce is that you must cook it S-L-O-W-L-Y (3-4
  hrs.), stirring often.
  
  When  finished cooking, add 3 tablespoons of dried mustard and stir in
  well.   For best results, use hot dogs with the "skin" on them
  (Capitol Lunches  the Martin Rosol's brand). Put the hot dog on a
  FRESH roll, spread on some fresh mustard,  fresh  chopped onion,
  spread on the sauce, and ENJOY!
  
  (Note:  This recipe makes a LOT of sauce, as you can imagine, since
  the quantities are for use in a restaurant. Use smaller amounts of all
  ingredients to suit your needs.) Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40

MMMMM---------------------FOR COOKING WATER--------------------------
      1 tb Oil
 
  Combine 4 eggs, 2 teaspoons oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt in bowl and
  whisk until well blended. Add flour, a little at a time, beating
  after each addition. Turn out onto well-floured board and knead
  several minutes until dough is firm and smooth but not dry. Add more
  flour if necessary to prevent sticking. Cover and let stand at
  slightly warm temperature about 30 minutes to ripen. Cut dough in
  2-inch portions and roll out slightly to flatten enough to fit into
  pasta machine. Roll in machine starting with thickest setting and
  progressing to next to finest setting until pasta is very thin
  (expansion takes place during cooking). Continue until all dough is
  rolled into strips. Place strips on floured board and sprinkle
  lightly with flour. Cut in 4-inch squares and let rest 10 minutes
  before filling and cooking. Meanwhile, to make sauce, saute onion and
  garlic in olive oil until golden. Add undrained tomatoes, basil and 2
  teaspoons salt. Season with pepper to taste. Bring to boil and simmer
  15 minutes. Add sugar at last minute. To make filling, combine
  ricotta, drained spinach, nutmeg, 4 eggs and Parmesan to taste in
  bowl and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring large
  pot of generously salted water to boil. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Drop
  each piece of pasta into boiling water and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or
  just until pasta floats to surface. Remove at once and plunge into
  bowl filled with ice water 1 minute. Drain pasta on clean cloth to
  prevent sticking. Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of each pasta
  square. Fold square into triangle, then again into smaller triangle.
  Press edges to seal. Pour layer of tomato sauce in large baking pan.
  Arrange cappellacci in rows, slightly overlapping. Cover with
  remaining sauce and sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese. Bake at
  400F 5 to 7 minutes.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
     12 sl French bread, crusts removed
      2 ts Butter
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Apple juice
      1 oz Butter
    1/2 c  Raisins
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      6 oz Cream cheese
    1/4 c  Pecan pieces
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Powdered sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  This recipe is a combination of one given to me by the Santa Fe
  School of Cooking and one tasted at the Border Grill in Los Angeles.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Tear
  bread into bite-sized pieces and place in baking dish.
  
  Toast in oven for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, over medium high heat, stir
  the sugar continuously in a saucepan until it melts and turns a light
  caramel color. Immediately add the water and apple juice.
  
  Be careful; the caramel will bubble and splatter. Do not bend over
  the pan when you do this! The caramel will partially solidify but
  will liquefy again as you heat it. Add the butter and raisins. When
  caramel is completely liquefied, remove from heat and stir in the
  vanilla.
  
  Pour mixture over the bread pieces in the baking dish. Make sure all
  of the bread is well soaked with caramel. Place tablespoons of the
  cream cheese throughout the bread. Sprinkle the top with pecans and
  cinnamon.
  
  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 to 26 minutes, or until all but a
  little of the caramel at the bottom of the dish is ab sorbed.
  
  Lightly whip the cream. Add the sugar and vanilla. Serve the pudding
  warm with the sweetened cream.
  
  Note: You may add a peeled, chopped apple or pear to the pudding
  before it is baked.

MMMMM-------------------KAREN PHILLIPS CBTX40A------------------------
  1 1/4 lb Medium bananas; unpeeled
      2 c  Half-and-half
  1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      6    Egg yolks
    1/8 ts Lemon juice
      1 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
      2 c  Heavy cream
 
  EQUIPMENT: Measuring cup, measuring spoons, 2 stainless steel bowls (1
  large), slotted spoon, film wrap, 2 1/2-qt saucepan, whisk, electric
  mixer with paddle, rubber spatula, instant-read test thermometer,
  ice-cream freezer, 2-qt plastic container with lid
  
  Peel the bananas. Using a slotted spoon, smash them to a
  rough-textured consistency in a stainless steel bowl. Cover with film
  wrap and set aside.
  
  Place 1/2 cup of sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan.
  Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand).
  Caramelize the sugar for 5 to 6 minutes over medium-high heat,
  stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar
  will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it
  caramelizes). Reduce the heat to medium.
  
  Carefully and slowly pour the heavy cream, then the half-and-half
  into the caramelized sugar (the mixture will steam and boil rapidly
  as the cream is added). Add 1/2 cup of sugar and whisk to dissolve.
  Bring to a boil, about 5 minutes.

      Yield: 38 Servings
 
      1    Wheel Brie - (60% butterfat
           -- about 2.8 pounds)
      2 c  Sugar - granulated
    1/2 c  Water
     16    Walnut halves - or pecan
           -halves (12 - 16 optional)
 
  Number of Servings:  38
  
  Put the Brie on a rack over a large sheet of parchment paper or
  aluminum foil. Combine sugar and water in a heavy saucepan and melt
  the sugar, swirling the pan from time to time. Do not stir. When the
  mixture
  
  begins to boil, cover the pan to allow condensation to drip back down
  and melt the crystallized sugar on the side of the pan. Uncover the
  pan after 3 to 5 minutes and continue cooking over high heat until
  sugar becomes a deep golden color.  The temperature of the caramel
  should be hard crack, 300F. Immediately pour the caramel over the
  cheese to cover the top evenly, allowing the excess to drip down the
  sides. You may have to tilt the cheese a little to spread the caramel
  evenly. Be very careful not to touch the hot caramel. Press nuts
  around the perimeter, if desired. The caramel will harden quickly.
  Serve within an hour. Present the cheese with small cheese knifes.
  The guests will have to crack through the caramel coating, but this
  is part of the fun of eating such an unusual treat.
  
  NOTE:  When working with melted sugar or caramel, always keep a bowl
  of ice water nearby. If you should burn yourself, plunge the burned
  area into the water.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
      1 pn Cream of tartar
           Aluminum foil
      6 oz Ladle
           Vegetable oil
           Candy thermometer
 
  Cover the outside (rounded part) of a 6 oz ladle with aluminum foil.
  Making sure to keep the surface smooth and tight. Lightly oil the
  domed surface of foil.
  
  Now pour into a saucepan the sugar, water and cream of tartar. Shake
  the pan to mix and cover. Heat this covered mixture over medium low
  heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove lid and continue cooking the
  syrp until it turns a light gold color (about 340 degrees F. on candy
  thermometer).
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and let sit at room temperature for 6-8
  minutes. The syrup will turn a darker gold color.
  
  Now you are ready to make the cages. Just hold the foil covered ladle
  over the pan, dip a spoon into the caramel mixture and drizzle over
  ladle, moving you hand around in a swirling motion to form a wed or
  lattice pattern on the foil. Prop up the ladle so the caramel cage
  cools completely (about 10 minutes).
  
  Pry foil away from the ladle carefully so as not to break the fragile
  cage. Trim away the uneven strands with scissors to form a nice
  straight bottom. Now carefully peel off the foil and you have a
  beautiful candy cage to place over a single scoop of ice cream. Try
  to find a dish so the cage fits on the edge of the dish. Instruct
  your guests to tap the cage with the back of a spoon and enjoy the

      3    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Milk
  1 1/2 c  Half and half
 
  FOR THE CARAMEL: Heat the oven to 375F. For the caramel, combine the
  sugar and water in a small saucepan. Swirl the pan until the sugar is
  dissolved, then cover the pan and cook over medium high heat until
  thick and large bubbles form. Uncover the pan, and cook until a rich,
  brown color. Watch the caramel, since it burns very quickly once it
  begins to color. Pour the syrup into the bottom of a mold, and rotate
  to cover the bottom and up a few inches of the sides evenly. Set
  aside. For the custard, whisk the eggs, yolks and sugar in a mixing
  bowl. Heat the vanilla, milk and half and half until hot to the
  touch, about 150F. Slowly add this to the egg mixture, and pour into
  the prepared mold. Place the mold in a baking pan, and place in the
  oven. Pour boiling water into the baking pan so it is half way up the
  sides of mold. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until a kniefe inserted
  in the center comes out cleam. Cool at room temperature, then
  refrigerate and serve chilled. To serve, invert the mold over a
  platter with sides to catch the caramel sauce. Note: The custard can
  be made up to two days in advance. If made in advance, refrigerate,
  covered with plastic wrap.

      Title: CARAMEL FRIED APPLES OR BANANAS
 Categories: Chinese, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  All purpose flour
      2 tb Cornstarch
    3/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Water
      2    Golden Delicious apples -or-
      2    Bananas
           Salad oil
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Warm water
      1 tb Salad oil
      2 ts Sesame seeds
 
  In a bowl, mix flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. Add water and
  stir until smooth.  Peel and core apples; cut each apple into 3
  wedges. (If you use bananas, peel and cut in 1/2 inch thick diagonal
  slices.) Place fruit in batter and turn to coat evenly. Into a deep
  pan pour oil to a depth of about 1 1/2 inches. Heat oil to 350
  degrees. Using chopsticks or a spoon, lift one piece of fruit at a
  time from batter and let excess batter drip off, then lower fruit
  into hot oil. Cook several pieces at a time until coating is golden
  brown (about 2 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on
  paper towels. Generously oil a flat serving dish. Fill a serving bowl
  to the brim with ice cubes; cover with water. Place sugar, water and
  oil in a ten inch frying pan; stir to blend. Place pan over high
  heat. When mixture begins to bubble (about one minute), shake pan
  continuously to prevent burning.  Continue cooking and shaking pan
  until syrup *just* turns a pale straw color (about 9 minutes).
  Immediately remove from heat, add sesame seeds, and swirl to mix.
  (Syrup will continue to cook after you remove it from heat and color
  will turn golden in a few seconds.) Drop fruit into syrup and swirl
  to coat evenly. Using two spoons, immediately remove each piece of
  fruit and place on oiled dish so pieces do not touch. At table, dip
  each piece of fruit in ice water so coating hardens and fruit cools.
  Serve.

 Categories: Desserts, Candies
      Yield: 19 Servings
 
      6 c  Sugar, divided
      2 c  Light cream
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
  8 1/2 c  (2 lbs.) pecans, broken
 
  The flavor of this golden brown fudge comes from the caramelized
  sugar. Combine 4 cups sugar and cream in a heavy 4-quart saucepan.
  Set aside. Melt 2 cups sugar in a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium
  heat. Stir sugar constantly until it begins to melt. Heat sugar-cream
  mixture over medium heat. Continue melting sugar in skillet, stirring
  and watching closely so it does not scorch. As soon as it is
  completely melted, por liquid sugar in a thin stream into boiling
  sugar-cream mixture, stirring constantly. Do not let sugar remain
  over heat after completely melted; this will produced a scorched
  taste. Cook com- bined mixtures to 246 degrees F. Remove from heat
  and add baking soda and butter. Stir in and let candy stand for 30
  minutes. Add nuts. Stir to mix; pour into buttered 9-inch square
  pans. Cool slightly and cut into squares. Makes about 78 pieces.

      Title: CARAMEL NUT FROSTING
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Light cane syrup (or corn
           -syrup
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/4 lb Butter (1 stick)
  1 1/2 c  Chopped pecans
 
  Place 1-1/2 cups of the sugar into a heavy saucepan, taking care that
  no crystals cling to the sides of the pan. Add syrup. Add cream by
  pouring down the sides of the pan to wash away any crystals that may
  have collected there. Place sauce pan over medium heat and stir as
  sugar melts. When mixture boils, place remaining sugar in a heavy
  saute pan (preferably cast iron) over medium heat and stir until
  sugar melts and turns golden brown. DO NOT LET SUGAR BURN OR IT WILL
  TASTE BITTER. Add browned sugar to the mixture in the saucepan. Stir
  and cook until mixture reaches the soft ball stage (240 deg).  Add
  vanilla and pour mixture over chunked butter in a mixing bowl. Let
  cool for about 5 minutes, then beat vigourously until frosting
  reaches spreading consistency. Add chopped pecans. Frost top of each
  layer, stacking one upon the other, then frost side of cake. Freezes
  well [but *I'll* never know]. ** The secret of success with this
  frosting is in the sugar. After the ingredients have reached the
  proper temperature, no sugar crystals can be introduced into the
  liquid, else the frosting will be grainy instead of smooth and creamy.

      Title: CARAMEL POWDER
 Categories: Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  For years one of my favorite things has been the sheets of "caramel"
  that resulted when I baked a ham and the glazing ran down onto the
  foil lined baking pan, then set up. Never occurred to me to use it in
  a recipe, but it did to someone at Sunset Magazine.  The illustration
  in the magazine shows the flan garnished with crunched up chunks of
  the un powdered caramel.
  
  Line a 10- by 15-inch baking pan with a single sheet of foil, folding
  up at edges.
  
  Pour 2 cups sugar into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan, place
  over medium-high heat. Shake pan often until most of the sugar
  liquefies, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; tilt pan to mix
  hot caramel with sugar until all is melted and the color is deep
  amber, 3 to 5 ea minutes.
  
  Immediately pour hot caramel into foil-lined pan. Using hot pads to
  protect hands (mixture is very hot), tilt pan to spread caramel in
  thin layer. Set aside until hard and completely cool, about 30
  minutes.
  
  When cool, lift foil from pan; peel foil from caramel. Break caramel
  into chunks.  To make powder, whirl chunks in a blender or food
  processor fitted with metal blade (container must be completely dry).
  If you use a blender, you may need to make powder in several batches.
  Use, or store airtight at room temperature for up to 1 month.
  
  Makes about 1 3/4 cups.

      Title: CARAMEL SAUCE (RAUTHIER)
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      4    Shallots, thinly sliced
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Thought your reference to cooking sugar syrup to "caramelize" it was
  interesting.  It reminded me of a sauce that's used in Vietnamese
  cuisine. It's used in a variety of recipes and turns out to be the
  "secret" ingredient that gives barbecued Vietnamese stuff that unique
  taste when used as a marinade for strips of beef, chicken or pork. I
  use it in Satay recipes. The result is a subtle, delicious taste. It
  also gives a nice glazed finish to stuff.  Its use shouldn't be
  limited to Asian cuisine. In fact, I suspect that this is originally
  a French influence...
  
  "...the only rule to remember is to turn off the smoke alarm and open
  all the windows, as the sauce will smoke heavily, with a pungent
  smell." [I didn't find this to be much of a problem. S.C..] Cook the
  sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low heat, swirling the pan
  constantly, until brown. It will smoke slightly. Immediately remove
  the pan from the heat and stir the fish sauce into the caramel, being
  careful to guard against splattering (the mixture will bubble
  vigorously).
  
  Return the mixture to low heat and gently boil, swirling the pan
  occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 3
  minutes. Add the shallots and ground pepper to taste; stir to
  combine. Use in recipes where required.  [Or, as I noted, as a
  marinade for BBQ stuff. S.C..]
  
  NOTE:  Cool this sauce thoroughly before using.  If cold food is
  added to a caramel sauce that is hot, the sugar will harden instantly

 Categories: Desserts, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Icing sugar
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
    1/4 c  Corn syrup (dark is best)
      1 ts Unflavored gelatin
    2/3 c  Sweetened condensed milk
 
  An upside down toffee-like confection.
  
  First Layer: Measure first 3 ingredients into bowl. Crumble together
  well. Press in ungreased 8 x 8-inch pan. Bake in 350 F oven for 20 to
  25 minutes. Cool.
  
  Second Layer: Melt the scond amount of butter and corn syrup in heavy
  saucepan. Measure sugar in cup. Stir in gelatin to mix thoroughly.
  Add to saucepan stirring to dissolve. Add condensed milk. Stir,
  bringing to a boil. Boil 4 minutes stirring constantly. It burns very
  easily when boiling. Remove from heat. Beat with spoon until it
  thickens and gets blobby. You will need to take a moment's rest now
  and then as you beat. Pour over first layer. Chill overnight. Invert
  on plastic wrap. This makes it much easier to cur through to the
  bottom. Cut into 25 squares.

      Title: CARAMEL TURTLE TRUFFLE TART
 Categories: Desserts, Candies
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           -Dorothy Cross TMPJ72B
      1    Stick (4 ozs) butter;
           -cut into 8 pieces
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/3 c  Flour
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
           -(9 ozs)
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/3 c  Heavy cream
      1 pk (14 oz.) vanilla caramels
      3 c  Chopped pecans
 
     Preheat oven to 400 degrees. To make crust, in a food processor,
  combine butter, sugar, and vanilla. Process 1 minute. Add flour and
  process to blend. With machine on, add egg through feed tube, and
  process just until dough forms and leaves sides of bowl.
     Press dough evenly into bottom and all the way up sides of an
  11-inch fluted metal tart pan with a removable bottom. Press a sheet
  of foil on top of crust and line with pie weights or dried beans.
  Bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and weights and bake 5 to 7 minutes
  longer, or until golden. Let cool.
     Meanwhile, prepare truffle mixture. In a 1-quart glass bowl,
  combine chocolate chips and 1/3 cup cream. Heat in a microwave oven
  on High 1 to 1-1/4 minutes, or until chocolate is melted and smooth
  when stirred. When crust is cool, spread three-quarters of truffle
  mixture evenly over bottom of crust. Refrigerate 15 minutes, or until
  truffle mixture is set.
     In a large skillet, combine caramels and remaining 1/2 cup cream.
  Heat over medium-low heat, stirring often, until caramels are melted
  and mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes. Stir in pecans. Spread evenly
  over chilled truffle mixture.
     Heat remaining chocolate truffle mixture in microwave oven on High
  15 to 20 seconds, if necessary, to melt. Drizzle with a fork over top
  of tart. Refrigerate until filling is set, at least 1 hour. Before
  serving, remove side of pan, and using a sharp knife, cut tart into
  slices.
  
  COMMENTS: This caramel tart, which tastes almost like a piece of
  candy, is a breeze to prepare with store-bought caramels. Pile the
  caramel-pecan mixture on top of a chocolate truffle mixture spread on
  a butter cookie crust.

      Title: CARAMELIZED APPLE GALETTE
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits, Martha stew
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        1    Recipe Quick Puff Pastry
  :          -(Recipe Follows)
        1    Northern Spy, Or
  :          Other Firm Baking Apple
      1/4 c  Sugar
        2 TB Unsalted Butter
        1 TB Calvados -- french apple
  :          brandy
  
  On a lightly floured work surface, roll out an eighth of quick puff
  pastry dough recipe to about 1/8 inch thickness. Using a sharp
  parking knife, cut dough into a circle about 7 1/2 inches in
  diameter. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet, and place in
  refrigerator to chill about 15 minutes. Heat oven to 425F. Place the
  chilled pastry dough in a heavy cast iron skillet that measure 6 1/2
  inches in diameter at the bottom. Peel, core and slice the apple in
  half lengthwise. Using a mandoline or very sharp knife, slice apple
  halves, widthwise into twenty five 1/8 inch slices. Arrange the
  slices in a neat fanned pattern, overlapping he apples, keeping them
  1/2 inch in from the edge of the pastry dough, fill in the center
  with smaller or broken apple slices as you create the fanned out
  circle. Sprinkle two tablespoons sugar over the apples, and dot with
  1 tablespoon butter, cut into very small pieces. Place skillet in the
  oven, and bake until the pstry has puffed up along the edges of te
  pan and is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove the skillet from
  the oven. Using a spatula remove the tart from the skillet, and
  transfer to a plate, set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon butter
  to the skillet, and place over medium heat. Add the remaining 2
  tablespoons sugar, and cook until the sugar dissolves and forms a
  light caramel, about 5 minutes. Measure Calvados into a glass then
  pour into the caramel, cook out the alcohol, about 2 to 3 minutes.
  Return the tart to the skillet, apple side down and cook 4 to 5
  minutes, until the caramel bubbles up over the tart, and starts to
  look a litle thick. Remove the skillet from theheat, and carefully
  invert the tart onto a plate large enough to catch the hot caramel as
  it drips out of the skillet.
  
  Quick Puff Pastry Makes 2 lbs
    1 3/4    cup all purpose flour 2 cups cake flour 1 teaspoon salt 2
  cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, very cold, cut into small pieces 1
  cup to 1 1/4 cups ice water 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
  
  Sift together the all purpose flour, cake flour and salt into a large
  chilled bowl. Cut in the pieces of butter, using a pastry knife until
  the butter is in very small lumps, about 1/2 inch in diameter.
  Combine the ice water and lemon juice, and stir into the flour
  mixture, a little at a time pressing the dough together with your
  hands until it comes together. Turn the dough out onto a well floured
  work surface and roll it into a 1/2 inch thick rough rectangle,
  approximately 12 by 18 inches. The dough will be very crumbly. Fold
  bottomof the rectangle toward the center, then the top of the
  rectangle toward the center, overlapping the bottom third, like a
  letter, and give the dough a quarter turn to the right. Roll the
  dough into a large rectangle, 1/2 inch thick and fold into thirds
  again. This completes the first double turn. Remove any excess flour
  with a wide dry brush.  Repeat rolling, folding, and turning process
  two more times to execute another double turn, refrigerating the
  dough for a few minutes if the butter becomes too warm. Wrap the
  dough in plastic, and put in refrigerator to chill for 1 hour. Remove
  chilled dough from the refrigerator.  Repeat rolling, folding, and
  turning process again to execture one more double turn. There will be
  six turns in all. The dough needsto be rolled out to 1/2 inch thick
  rectangle each time.With each turn, the dough will become smoother
  and easier to handle. Store the dough, wrapped well in plastic in the
  refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for 3 months.

      Title: CARAMELIZED FENNEL SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Fennel bulbs; trim/mince
      6 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      4 c  Vegetable or chicken broth
    1/2 c  Whipping cream; opt
           Sea salt; to taste

MMMMM-----------------------BOUQUET GARNI----------------------------
           Fresh rosemary
           Fresh parsley
           Bay leaf
           Fresh thyme
           Tie together with twine
 
  1. Combine fennel and oil in large, heavy-bottomed stockpot. Stir to
  coat fennel with oil. Cook, covered, over low heat 10 minutes,
  stirring occasionally. If fennel burns it will give the soup a bitter
  taste.
  
  2. Remove lid; continue to cook over low heat. Pieces should gradually
  brown and caramelize. Add bouquet garni and broth; simmer; covered, 30
  minutes.
  
  3. Discard bouquet garni. Using an immersion blender, roughly puree
  soup in stockpot. (Alternatively, pass soup through coarse blade of
  food mill or puree coarsely in batches in food processor; and return
  to stockpot.) Soup should be creamy but not totally smooth. Stir in
  cream, if using; reheat. Taste for seasoning. Serve piping hot in
  warmed shallow soup bowls.
  
  NOTE: Fennel has a tough outer skin. It's well worth it to peel it
  with a vegetable peeler.

  bits. Cook for 4 or 5 minutes longer. Serve hot or at room
  temperature.

      Title: CARAMELS AU CHOCOLAT (CHOCOLATE CARAMELS)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Milk
     13 oz Powdered sugar
           Eggsize piece of glucose
  3 1/4 oz Chocolate in tablets
  1 1/2 oz Butter
    1/2    Vanilla bean
 
  Put milk, sugar, vanilla bean and glucose into a stewpan. Put the
  chocolate into a round-bottomed copper pan and melt it slowly on the
  stove. Meanwhile, heat the mixture in the stewpan, not letting it
  boil, since you merely want to melt the sugar and glucose. When
  completely melted, pour this mixture, bit by bit, into the chocolate,
  while stirring. When thoroughly mixed, cook at moderate heat,
  constantly stirring. Cook to the 'ball' stage. (To test the stage of
  cooking by finger, dip the thumb and index finger into cold water,
  then into the mixture, bringing the 2 fingers together and dipping
  them again into water. This should be done quickly to avoid burning.
  The mixture forms a ball that can be rolled with the tip of the
  fingers.) Remove from the fire, add the butter, mix well, and pour
  onto an oiled marble slab in an oiled, iron framework. Let cool and
  cut.
