  Place a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) in a round wicker
  basket that's at least twice the size of the dough. Dust the towel
  liberally with flour. Place the round dough in the center of the
  basket. Place basket in a warm place and let dough rise, uncovered,
  about 45 minutes until double in size. 4. Gently turn dough out of
  basket upside down onto a greased baking sheet. With a very sharp
  knife held almost parallel to the loaf, carefully slash the top of
  the dough at sharp angles in a # pattern. 5. Preheat oven to 450F.
  Place a small pan on the floor or bottom shelf of the oven and
  carefully add at least 1 cup boiling water to the pan. Place dough in
  oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and place on cake rack
  to cool 1 hours before slicing. To preserve the crisp crust, do not
  store in plastic wrap or bag. Bread can be loosely covered or left
  out for up to two days before it dries out completely. From THE BREAD

 Categories: Breads, French
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Envelope dry yeast
      3 c  Warm water (105 F to 115 F)
      8 c  (about) unbleached
           -all-purpose flour
      1 tb Salt
           Cornmeal
      1    Egg white beaten with 1 Tbs
           -water (glaze)
 
  Soak a brick in water overnight, then drain it and put it in the oven
  with the bread to create steam.  This gives the loaves a firm crust.
  
  Makes 12 small loaves
  
  Soak brick in water overnight.
  
  Sprinkle yeast onto 1/4 cup warm water in bowl of electric meixer
  fitted with a dough hook;  stir to dissolve. Let stand 5 minutes. Add
  remaining water, 4 cups flour and salt and beat until smooth. Beat in
  remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until slightly sticky dough forms.
  Mix until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Turn dough out onto
  lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and no longer sticky,
  adding more flour if necessary, about 3 minutes. (Dough can also be
  mixed and kneaded by hand.) Grease large bowl and add dough, turning
  to coat surface. Cover with damp towel. Let rise at room temperature
  8 hours.
  
  Punch dough down and knead on lightly floured surface until smooth,
  about 2 minutes.  Return to greased bowl, turning to coat entire
  surface. Cover with damp towel and let rise in warm draft-free area
  until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
  
  Grease baking sheets and sprinkle with cornmeal. Punchy dough down and
  knead on lightly floured surface until smooth, about 2 minutes.
  Divide into 12 pieces. Pat each into 4x7-inch rectangle. Roll up
  jelly roll fashion, starting at one long side. Pinch seams to seal.
  Arrange seam side down on prepared sheets, spacing 3 inches apart.
  Let rise until almost doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 475 F.  Remove brick from water and place in oven.
  Make 3 diagonal slashes in loaves. Brush with egg glaze. Bake 10
  minutes. Reduce oven to 350 F and continue baking until loaves sound
  hollow when tapped on bottom, about 35 minutes. Cool on racks before
  serving.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  5 3/4 c  Sifted flour
      1 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      2 c  Very warm water
      1    Egg white, unbeaten
 
  Altitude: 5,000 ft. Yield: 2 loaves
  
  In a large bowl, thoroughly mix 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast.
  Add water and beat at medium speed of electric mixer for 2 minutes,
  scraping bowl occasionally. Gradually stir in 3 1/2 cups more flour,
  or enough flour to make a soft dough.
  
  Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup flour on bread board or pastry cloth. Turn
  dough out on floured surface and knead until smooth and satiny, 5 to
  10 minutes. Shape into smooth ball. Place in greased bowl, turning
  once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (80-90
  degrees) until double (about 1 hour).
  
  Punch down.  Divide into halves.  Shape each half into a ball. Cover
  and let rest 5 minutes.  Rub a little shortening on palms of hands.
  Roll each ball of dough under the hands to form a long slender loaf
  about 3 inches in diameter.  Start rolling at the center and gently
  work hands toward end of loaf, repeating until loaf is shaped. Place
  loaves 4 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheet. With a sharp
  knife, cut diagonal gashes abut 1/4 inch deep and about 1 1/2 inches
  apart into top of each loaf.
  
  Cover and let rise until a little more than doubled (about 1 hour).
  Bake in moderately hot oven (425 degrees) 25 to 35 minutes. Remove
  from oven, brush with egg white.  Return to oven for 2 minutes.
  Remove from baking sheet and cool on racks.
  
  Hint:  For crustier loaf, bake bread with a shallow pan of water on
  lower oven rack.

  mixture. The puffs will get hard and crusty if rolled in the butter
  then reheated.  Serve hot.

      Title: FRENCH CABBAGE SALAD
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Cabbage, shredded
    1/4 lb Bacon
      2 c  Onion, chopped
      1    Garlic clove, chopped
    1/2 c  White-wine tarragon
           -vinegar
 
  Cut the bacon into tiny bits, fry it in a big deep frying pan, and
  fish out all the bits after they are crisp. Cut up the onion and
  garlic and fry them in the bacon fat. When they are brown, pour in
  the vinegar.
  
  Bring it just up to a simmer, add all the cabbage and bacon, toss it
  as you would a salad, and serve it. The cabbage doesn't cook, but it
  wilts a little under the hot vinegar.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Wilted cabbage salad with bacon -- This is a wonderful thing to do
  with cabbage.  With no garlic, and using cider vinegar, it becomes
  German cabbage salad. Adding sour cream to that makes Danish cabbage
  salad.
  
  *  Cut the vinegar with a little water if you don't like very sour
  things,

           -Salt and Pepper
 
  "Newfoundland Pea Soup is very similar, but usually includes more
  vegetables such as diced turnips and carrots, and is often topped with
  small dumplings. This soup is very good reheated.. The most authentic
  version of Quebec's soupe aux pois use whole yellow peas, with salt
  pork and herbs for flavour. After cooking, the pork is usually
  chopped and returned to the soup, or sometimes removed to slice
  thinly and served separately. Instead of fresh or dried herbs, herbes
  salees (herbs preserved with salt) are often used; they are available
  commercially or made at home.
    Pea soup remains a popular dish in restaurants where tourists enjoy
  a true taste of old Quebec. In some variations, a little garlic,
  leeks, other vegetables or a ham bone are added for flavour. For a
  thicker consistency (though this is not traditional) a cup or two of
  cooked peas can be pureed then returned to the soup."
  
  Wash and sort peas; soak in cold water overnight. Drain and place in a
  large pot; add water, parsley, salt pork, onion, celery, carrots,
  parsley, bay leaf, savory and 1 tsp salt. Bring to a boil; reduce
  heat and simmer until peas are very tender, about 2 hours, adding
  more water if needed. Remove salt pork; chop and return to soup.
  Discard bay leaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper. MAKES 8

      Title: FRENCH CHOCOLATE CAKE
 Categories: Chocolate, French, Cakes
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      7 oz Semisweet chocolate
     14 tb Butter or margarine
      4    Eggs
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Hazelnuts, coarsely chopped
      1 ts Baking powder
 
  Makes about 10 servings
  
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Grease a springform pan with
  detachable bottom that has a diameter of about 9 1/2 inches.
  
  Melt cooking chocolate and butter in a  thick-bottomed pot over low
  heat. Beat eggs and sugar until light and airy. Carefully stir the
  somewhat cooled chocolate mixture into egg mixture.
  
  Blend flour, nuts, and baking powder together, and fold carefully into
  batter.  It's important to fold it in gently.
  
  Pour batter into pan and bake in the oven for about 15 minutes. The
  cake should not become firm.  The "unbaked" batter tastes like a
  delicious filling.
  
  You may garnish cooled cake with a bit of grated chocolate and a ring
  of whipped topping.

MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      2 ts Espresso coffee,

    1/4 c  Water, hot
      7 oz Chocolate, semisweet
      2 oz Chocolate, bitter
      4    Eggs, separated
      4 oz Butter
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
    3/4 c  Cornstarch, sifted

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
      2 ts Espresso coffee,
           -instant
      7 oz Chocolate, semisweet
      2 oz Chocolate, bitter
      2 tb Butter
 
  Combine espresso, hot water, semisweet chocolate and bitter chocolate
  in double boiler filled with hot water and cover. Without applying
  additional heat, melt the chocolate.
  
  Butter two layer-cake pans, lay a sheet of waxed paper in each, and
  dust the pans with flour. (The pans should be able to hold about 4
  cups each.)
  
  Beat the egg yolks and then gradually add about 2/3 cup of sugar
  until the yolks are thick and lemon colored.
  
  Beat butter into the chocolate mixture.  Add the chocolate mixture to
  the egg yolks and stir.
  
  Beat the egg whites until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar, and then
  gradually add up to 2 T sugar.
  
  Add the sifted corn starch gradually to the chocolate mixture,
  alternating with the egg whites.  The corn starch and egg whites
  should be folded in to the chocolate mixture.
  
  Pour half the batter into each cake pan.  Bake on the lower middle
  level of a preheated 350 degree F. oven until set on the sides. Cool
  the cake in the pan, and then turn out onto a serving dish.
  
  Combine the icing ingredients and ice the cake as you would a normal
  layer cake.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A decadently rich chocolate cake -- My mother got this recipe from
  a radio show about ten years ago. She was intrigued because the cake
  contains no flour. It is definitely for chocoholics. Although it is a
  two-layer cake, it is only about 3-4 inches thick when it's done, and
  has the consistency and density of a chocolate candy bar. It can be
  frozen if you find it too much to eat at one time.

      Title: FRENCH COGNAC VANILLA
 Categories: Sauces, Mixes, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Bottle
 
    759 ml Bottle of French cognac
      9    Vanilla beans
 
  Cut vanilla beans in half, crosswise.  Split beans open and scrape
  seeds out.  Add beans and seeds to cognac. Let set for at least 2
  months, shaking bottle frequently. It will still have more of the
  cognac smell than it does a vanilla odor.  The flavor cooks into the
  food as it bakes. This is very expensive and very good. You can buy
  American cognac which is much cheaper, but the results are not as
  good.

  create steam.  Using sharp knife, cut 3 diagonal slits across top of
  each loaf.  Place baking sheet with 2 loaves in oven. Bake until

      1 c  Milk, scalded
    1/2 c  Shortening (butter is best)
    1/2 c  Sugar (or 1/4 c)
      1 ts Salt
      2 pk Dry yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water (105-115)
      4    Eggs, beaten

  all). Punch dough down and divide in half. Turn dough out onto a
  lightly floured board.  Roll each half into a 12 x 6" rectangle.
  Brush 2 T butter over top of each.  Cut each rectangle into 6 1"
  strips. Stack 6 strips of dough, butter side up on top of one
  another.  Cut each stack into 12 pieces about 1" wide.  Place in well
  buttered muffin cups sideways.

      Title: FRENCH FRIED GOLDEN ONION RINGS
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables, French
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
      3 lg Onions, Sweet
      1 c  Flour; sifted
  1 1/2 ts Baking Powder
      1    Egg; slightly beaten
    2/3 c  -water
    1/2 tb Lemon Juice
      1 tb Margarine, melted
           Oil for deep frying
 
  Peel onions, cut into 1/4 inch slices; separate into rings.
  
  Sift flour, baking powder and salt into medium size bowl. Stir in egg,
  water, lemon juice and melted margarine just until blended.
  
  Dip onion rings in batter, a few at a time; fry in oil heated to 375
  degrees (a cube of day-old bread will brown in 1 minute) about 2
  minutes on each side.
  
  Drain the golden rings on absorbent paper. Keep hot in a low
  temperature oven (325 degrees)  until all are cooked.
  
  =========================> Notes and Credits <========================
  
  The batter forms a crisp puffy envelope for this popular vegetable.
  There is archaeological evidence that onions (lily family) were
  cultivated more than 4,000 years ago. Onions, radishes and garlic
  were consumed in quantity by the laborers who built the Great Pyramid
  in Egypt.

      Title: FRENCH FRIES
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
           Potatoes
           Water
           White vinegar
           Oil
           Crisco
 
  To make French Fries at home, use only long white Burbank Russets.
  Peel and cut in half lengthwise.  It will be easier to manage them
  when you cut each then into strips with a sharp knife. Place cut
  sides of potatoes on a board and remove a thing slice from each end
  and a slice from the rounded longside of it, too. You know have
  almost a rectangle shape to work with. Slice this into 1/4" thick
  strips. Place in a deep refrigerator container.
  
  Mix 1 quart water with 1/2 cup white vinegar, repeating it until you
  have enough to cover potatoes. Cover the container and chill the
  submerged poratoes several hours. This draws out the starch that
  makes a fried potato, otherwise limp and holds the grease. Drain them
  well on paper toweling.
  
  Drop a few at a time, using a French frying basket, into 425 degrees
  F -- oil, at least 4" deep in heavy 2 1/2 quart saucepan. Let them
  "blanche" in the oil rather than fry completely, removing the
  potatoes after 1 minute. At once drop them into a freezer container
  or on a cookie sheet & place in your freezer for 10 minutes. Return
  them to the oil to fry till golden brown at that time, draining them
  well on paper toweling.
  
  Salt them as you wish, which also helps to evaporate any excess
  greease ont he finished potatoes.  Most of the salt will fall off
  when the potatoes are transfered to serving plates.
  
  If the oil is not hot enough the potatoes will be greasy. A good
  combination is 1 pint corn oil to 1 cup Crisco shortening, using as
  much as is needed for the amount you are preparing, keeping ti 4"
  deep at
      425    degrees F -- in the pan.

  struggle to get some work done, take notes, or make plans.
  
  Dr. Gary Fauskin prefers to devise recipes, and his French Gulch Corn
  Casserole is the happy result of his self-adminstered in-flight
  psycho-therapy.
  
  On a recent trip from San Jose to Redding en route to French Gulch, he
  warded off apprehension by considering the inadequacies of existing
  corn casseroles and planning improvements. This is his winning
  formula.

  and salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Scrape mixture into a shallow 1-1/2 quart casserole; sprinkle with

      Yield: 2 Cups
 
    1/2 c  Tarragon
    1/2 c  Chervil
      2 tb Sage leaves
    1/2 c  Thyme
      2 tb Rosemary
      5 tb Chives (freeze-dried),
           -chopped
      2 tb Orange rind,
           -desiccated
      2 tb Celery seed, ground
 
  Dump everything together and mix until well-combined. Pack into small
  jars and label (the now-empty spice jars that held the ingredients
  are a good size). Store in a cool dry place. Crumble spices in hand
  when using. Measure spices by volume, not by weight, because of the
  large variation in moisture content.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A French-style mixture of herbs and seeds -- I found this in some
  magazine many many years ago. I usually make it every year or so and
  give it  to people as presents. The recipients are continually asking
  either for the recipe or refills. This goes well in soups and similar
  things but is especially good in scrambled eggs.

  French omelettes are quite thick, so the size of the pan is
  important, for a 3 egg omelette you need a 5-inch frying pan,
  10-inches for a 6 egg omelette and so on. Cut the bread into small
  squares of about half to quarter of an inch. Fry them in oil gently
  and remove from the pan as soon as they turn golden. Wipe the pan out
  and put in the butter. In a bowl lightly beat the three eggs. Heat
  the butter until it hisses. The moment it stops hissing pour in the
  three beaten eggs and with the back of a fork, scramble them in the
  hot butter for about a minute until all the egg is cooked. When it
  looks sort of soft scrambled addd the cheese, sprinkle over the
  croutons and season. While the middle is still a little moist, fold
  it with a palette knife or fork and tip it onto a warm plate. The
  omelette will go on cooking for another 35 seconds to a minute after
  you have taken it out so unless you like eggy shoe leather, take it
  out of the pan just before it is cooked. It is a wonderful omelette,
  slightly soft in the middle, crunchy and cheesy.

      Title: FRENCH ONION SOUP (CHILD)
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 tb Butter
      1 tb Light olive oil or fresh
           -peanut oil
      8 c  Thinly sliced onions (2 1/2
           -pounds)
    1/2 ts Each salt and sugar (sugar
           -helps the onions to brown)
      2 tb Flour
  2 1/2 qt Homemade beef stock, (see
           -following recipe for
           -stock), at
           Least 2 cups of which
           -should be hot
      4    To 5 tablespoons Cognac,
           -Armagnac, or other good
           -brandy
      1 c  Dry white French vermouth
 
  The following three recipes are from the book by Julia Child that I
  was raving about the other day.  They actually produce two dishes;
  the basic butterflied chicken recipe can stand alone or be used as
  the starting point for all sorts of variations++the Mustard Coated
  Chicken is just one of the possible take-offs using it. It's nicely
  hoity-toity in appearance and tastes great.
  
  This is certainly one of the all-time favorites.  The canned and
  packaged onion soups I've tried have been very good, and the only way
  to better them is for you to have your own beautiful beef stock.
  However, bought onion soup will benefit from the flavor additions
  suggested here. TIMING: For most delicious results, you want a slow
  simmer for 2 3/4 to 3 hours.
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:
  
  A food processor with slicing blade or a hand slicer is useful for the
  onions; a heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan with cover for onion
  cooking and simmering.
  
  Browning the onions - 40 minutes.  Set the saucepan over moderate
  heat with the butter and oil; when the butter has melted, stir in the
  onions, cover the pan, and cook slowly until tender and translucent,
  about 10 minutes. Blend in the salt and sugar, raise heat to
  moderately high, and let the onions brown, stirring frequently until
  they are dark walnut color, 25 to 30 minutes.
  
  Simmering the soup.  Sprinkle in the flour and cook slowly, stirring,
  for another 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from heat, let cool a moment,
  then whisk in 2 cups of hot stock. When well blended, bring to the
  simmer, adding the rest of the stock, the Cognac or brandy, and the
  vermouth. Cover loosely, and simmer very slowly 1 1/2 hours, adding a
  little water if the liquid reduces too much.  Correct seasoning.
  
  Ahead-of-time note:  May be prepared in advance; chill uncovered, then
  cover and refrigerate or freeze.
  
  Serving.  Serve the soup as it is, accompanying it with French bread
  and a bowl of grated Swiss or Parmesan cheese, or gratine it as
  follows. Makes about
    2 1/2    quarts, serving 6.
  
  VARIATION:
  
  ONION SOUP GRATINEED:  When onion soup is a main course, bake it in
  the oven with cheese and toasted French bread, and bring it all
  crusty and bubbling to the table. A big salad, more bread and cheese,
  and fruit could finish the meal,; accompanied by a bottle or two of
  fruity white wine, like a sauvignon blanc or even a gewurztraminer.
  
  MANUFACTURING NOTE:  Be sure you have a homemade type of bread with
  body here because flimsy loaves will disintegrate into a slimy mass;
  a recipe for your own homemade French bread also follows.
  
  12 or more Hard-Toasted French Bread Rounds (follows, too) [I left it
  out. S.C.] 1 to 2 ounces Swiss cheese, very thinly sliced Ingredients
  for the preceding French Onion Soup, heated 3/4 to 1 cup finely
  grated Swiss or Parmesan cheese
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:  A lightly buttered 3-quart ovenproof
  casserole or baking dish about 3 inches deep - good-looking if
  possible. Assembling and baking - about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven
  to 425F and set the rack in the lower middle level.  Line the bottom
  of the casserole with half the slices of toasted French bread, and
  spread over them the sliced cheese.  Ladle on the hot onion soup and
  float over them a layer of toasted bread, topping with the grated
  cheese. At once set in the preheated oven and bake for 20 to 30
  minutes, until the cheese has melted and browned nicely.  Serve as
  soon as possible, if you dally too long, the toast topping may sink
  into the soup.

      Title: FRENCH ONION SOUP (MACRO)
 Categories: Mexican
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 c  ; water -- or 6 cups
      1    Onions; or 3 -- with skins*
      1    Clean -- yellow onions with
      1    Brown skin
      1    Wakame; or kombu -- 3 in
      1    Piece
      1 tb Oil, corn -- or sesame
      1 ts Barley malt
    1/4 c  Tamari
      2 ts Vinegar, rice
 
  *Peel onions reserving skins. Bring water to a boil. Add onion skins
  and kombu. Remove kombu after at least 5 minutes. (I use the wakame
  and cut it up finely and put it back in the pot because I want to get
  all the sea veg I can).  Let onion skins continue to cook until water
  is deep yellow. Slice onions in half moons or dice and saute in oil
  until translucent. Add the barley malt.  Saute until lightly browned.
  Drain cooking stock and add onion mixture to it. Add the tamari and
  rice vinegar. Simmer 10 minutes. Serve with chopped parsley or baked
  mochi cubes.
  
  Original Poster's Note: That is the way I got the recipe from Deborah
  Kelley on *P.  You know me, I have to add or change. I add a
  tablespoon of dark brown miso at the end of cooking. (Do not boil
  miso as it destroys some of the enzymes in it.)  That way I get my
  miso soup every day. I get a thick slice of sourdough bread and toast
  it under the broiler, put it in the soup bowl and ladle the soup over
  it.

  under the grill for 1 to 2 minutes only to melt the cheese. Do not
  leave for too long a period, otherwise the cheese becomes ` stringy'.

    1/4 c  Tamari soy sauce
      2 tb Powdered vegetable broth
 
  A simple fat free delicious onion soup that was altered to nonfat
  from the original recipe.  For a richer soup, you may add 4T butter
  and use regular cheese in hot soup.  The nutritional analysis does
  not reflect the changes. In a large non stick skillet saute half the
  onions until they are a deep brown but not burned. The trick is to
  cook them until they are well browned and tender yet still have a
  little firmness. Add a little water at a time to keep onions from
  sticking. If you have chosen to use butter then you can saute the
  onions in butter. Repeat with remaining onions. In a 3-4 qt pot place
  all the sauteed onions the garlic & water. Bring to a boil reduce
  heat and simmer covered about 20 min or until soup broth is quite
  flavorful. Turn burner to lowest heat. Add tamari and vegetable broth
  powder. Add a little more water if desired.
   Serve hot topped with cheese & croutons or French bread. The
  nutritional analysis does not reflect these additions. Nutrition (per

  Sweet, in this classic soup recipe. When microwaved, these high-sugar
  onions cook more quickly and are less bitter than more pungent
  varieties.

      Title: FRENCH ONION SOUP - JARLSBERG
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter; light
      1 tb Fructose
      1 c  Wine; white zinfandel
    1/2 ts Pepper, ground; fresh
      8 oz Jarlsberg cheese; sliced
           Paprika
      4 lg Onions; spanish or
      8 md Onions; vidalia
      1 tb Flour
      3 cn Beef broth
      1    Bread, french; dried
      1 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
      1 c  Swiss cheese; grated
 
   In a large, heavy dutch oven melt the light butter slowly. When
  melted, add the sliced onions, and fructose (normal table sugar may
  be used if desired.) Cover, and cook - stirring often - until the
  onions are tender but colorless.
  
   Take the top off the pan, turn the heat up to high - then cook the
  onions until the sugar caramalizes on them turning them a golden
  caramel color.
  
   Stir in the flour and make a roux.  Blend well and cook over medium
  heat for three minutes until the starchy flavor of the flour is
  cooked out.
  
   Carefully add the wine and pepper to the onions while stirring over
  high heat until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens.
  
   Pour in the beef broth and bring to a boil.  When the soup begins to
  boil, cover, reduce heat - and simmer for twenty minutes so the
  flavors have time to blend.
  
   To prepare for table, ladle the soup into small fire proof crocks or
  broiler safe bowls.  Float slices of dried French bread in the bowls
  then add a 1/4 c of each of the grated cheeses, topping it all off
  with a slice of Jarlsberg cheese. Let the slices overlap the sides of
  the bowl slightly the toasted cheese that runs over the side is a
  delicacy for most french onion soup lovers! Place the crocks under
  your broiler and watch carefully as the cheese on top melts, bubbles
  and begins to turn a rich dark brown on top of the bubbles.
  
   When you see the bubbles browing - your done.  Enjoy!

   In a large frying pan or skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon,
  onion and garlic until lightly browned and the bacon is crispy. Sir
  in the pecans, salt, pepper, rosemary and cumin seed. Set aside. In
  the work bowl of a food processor, using the plastic dough blade,
  combine 3 cups of the bread flour and the sauteed onion mixture. Add
  the yeast, egg and the swiss cheese and combine thoroughly. With the
  machine still running add the water slowly until the mixture begins
  to pull together and forms a ball. If the dough is sticky, add the
  remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time. Process until the dough cleans the
  sides of the work bowl, then knead for approximately 1 minute longer.
  The dough should be smooth and elastic and bounce back when pressed
  with your finger. Place the dough into a lightly oiled freezer type
  plastic bag and put in a warm place to double in volume, about 1
  hour. Remove the dough from the bag and punch down. Shape the dough
  into a round, placing the dough on a lightly greased baking sheet
  that has been dusted with the cornmeal. Make 3 or 4 decorative
  slashes into the top of the bread and brush with the egg glaze. Allow
  to rise again , in a warm draft free area until doubled, about 45
  minutes. Place the dough into a preheated 375 degree oven and cook
  for 35-40 minutes or until the bread is golden and the bottom sounds
  hollow when taped with your finger (or the dough registers 190
  degrees on an instant read thermometer). Place the bread directly on
  a wire rack to cool. this bread freezes well for 2-3 months if
  tightly wrapped. To serve, defrost overnight in the foil. To rewarm,
  place the thawed bread, still wrapped in the foil in a 350 degree
  oven for 15-20 minutes. If reheated in this manner, the bread will
  retain it's freshly baked qualities.

 Categories: Beverages

    1/2 lb French or Italian sugar
           -plums
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar
    1/2 c  Cognac or brandy
  1 1/2    (750 ml) bottles Rhone-style
           -red wine
 
  A friend in France serves this wine as an aperitif in win- ter. It is
  very warming on a cold night and carries the scent of the summer
  prune plum.
  
  Rinse and carefully dry plums. Put in a clean glass jar and sprinkle
  with 1/4 cup of the powdered sugar and the Cognac. Cover and let the
  mixture stand for 5 days in a cool, dark place, turning the jar
  occasionally. At the end of the 5 days, add wine. Cover and let stand
  another 5 days, turning occasionally.
  
  Remove fruit from the jar and crush it to extract all the juice.
  Discard pits and skin. Return juice and pulp to wine mixture and
  filter it into bottles. (A coffee filter or doubled cheesecloth in a
  funnel works quite well.) Cork the bottles and store in a cool dark
  place or in the refrigerator.
  
  Makes two 750-milliliter bottles.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        2    eggs at room temperature
    1 1/2 TB butter
  :          Garnish:
  :          Garlic, chive or red pepper
  :          butter
  :          Fresh herbs
  
  1 heavy omelet pan, 10 inches across the top and 7 inches across
  bottom, with low, sloping sides and a non-stick bottom
  
  Beat eggs for 20-30 seconds at most. Place butter in a hot pan.
  Butter is ready when foam starts to subside and maybe starts to brown
  a little.
  
  Pour in the eggs. Let set for 2-3 seconds then cook for 20-30 seconds
  until just golden, tilting pan and rolling egg toward opposite side
  of pan, using a spatula to help push it and keep it together. Keep
  the pan tilted at a slight angle, away from you, gradually flipping
  the pan so that the omelet flips over onto itself.
  
  Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve, brushing with garlic, chive
  or red pepper butter and fresh herbs for garnish.
  
  FRENCH OMELET VARIATION: After eggs set for 2-3 seconds, sprinkle
  Gruyere cheese across raw middle.
  
  DUCK FAT VARIATION: Use 2 tablespoons of duck fat in place of the
  butter.
  
  Suggested wine: A light, crisp young white wine such as a Muscat from
  the Alsace region--perhaps one from Dirler.

      Title: FRENCH VANILLA CUSTARD ICE-CREAM
 Categories: Ice cream
      Yield: 5 Cups
 
      4    Egg yolks
      4 c  Whipping cream *
    2/3 c  White sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 tb Vanilla extract
 
  * (2 cups scalded, 2 cups left as is)
  
  1.Beat the four egg yolks with the sugar and salt until thick and pale
  yellow.
  
  2.Stir in 2 cups scalded whipping cream.
  
  3.Cook in heavy saucepan or in top of double boiler over _low_ heat,
  stirring often (constantly is more like it), until mixture thickens
  enough to coat a spoon.
  
  4.Remove mixture from heat and add the vanilla and the remaining 2
  cups of whipping cream. Stir well.
  
  5.Cover and chill thoroughly.
  
  6.Freeze according to instructions that come with your machine.
  
  This makes about 5 cups (or a little more) of liquid so if your
  machine is small, freeze half at a time. This makes for better
  ice-cream because it gets frozen faster and increases in volume at a
  much greater rate. Trying to do too much at one time is not worth it.
  Haste makes waste usually, but in ice-cream, haste makes less product.
  
  Variations: add melted baker's bittersweet chocolate (4 or 5 cubes
  (oz.) to the custard mixture when removed from the heat.
  
  Substituting maple syrup and a tich of maple flavouring and some
  broken walnuts makes great maple walnut ice-cream.
  
  As long as the the custard mixture is part of your recipe you can add
  (almost) anything you want, ie. flavouring and nuts or chocolate
  chips, fresh fruit, etc.

           Adolph's Meat Tenderizer
           Coarsley grnd black pepper
           Squeezable soft margarine
 
  The secret to good venison is always to muscle the meat. Muscling
  means to remove each muscle individually. Once finished, the cook
  will have several cylindrical pieces resembling tenderloin. Place
  pieces in a Pyrex dish, sprinkle each side with meat tenderizer and
  coarsley ground black pepper. Puncture each side liberally with a
  sharp fork. Squeeze margarine on one side. Turn meat over and repeat
  process on other side. Broil on high heat for about 4 minutes. Turn
  meat over and broil until brown. Remember venison is not as good when
  it is overcooked.

    1/4 ts Cream Of Tartar
     10    Maraschino Cherries; Chopped
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together sugar, butter and
  shortening.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
  addition. Add flour and Fresca alternately. Add baking powder and
  when mixture is fully creamed, add vanilla and fruit rinds.  Pour
  into greased and floured 9 X 13-inch Cake Pan.  Bake 1 hour or until
  cake tester comes out clean. FROSTING: Mix all ingredients except
  cherries and beat constantly while heating in the top of a double
  boiler. When thoroughly mixed, thick, and spreadable, frost cake.
  Decorate top of cake with chopped maraschino cherries. NOTE: Since
  Fresca is available only in limited areas if at all, 7-up may be a
  good substitution, or any lemon-lime drink. Also, since the problem
  with the cherries has been resolved with a different food coloring,
  you may use the new ones or use gum drops instead for the garnish.
  Syrup from a can of dark cherries might be substituted for the
  Maraschino cherry syrup.

  rinse and drain. To determine if cod has soaked enough; taste soaking
  water. The cod is soaked if the mix is *slightly* salty and the fish
  has plumped up to nearly double it's original size. Soaking cod too
  long results in fish fiber with no taste.
   In a large saucepan, Mix together the soaked and drained salt cod,
  water and milk. put the, bay leaf, thyme and parsley. in a 4 inch
  square piece of cheesecloth and tie it together with string. Place

  for 5 minutes more. Drain and remove the fish to a large bowl to
  cool, discarding the flavoring ingredients.
   Flake fish with a fork and set aside. In a large skillet, melt the
  butter until sizzling, add the celery and chopped onion and cook
  until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the cooked
  vegetables to the flaked fish, add the egg and mix to coat, then add
  the green onions, chives, parsley, cayenne pepper, tabasco sauce,
  dried mustard, worcestershire sauce, mayonnaise, lemon juice, bread
  crumbs, and salt and pepper to taste, Form the mixture into 6 to 8,
  3" to 4" patties, 1/2 cup of mix makes 3" patties. Place on a baking
  sheet and cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
   If the mixture is too wet, add more breadcrumbs as needed. When
  ready to cook, whisk together the egg yolk and milk in a small bowl.
  In a small shallow pie plate combine the cornmeal and flour. Dip a
  codcake into the flour mixture, then in the egg and milk mixture and
  finally dredge them in the remaining breadcrumbs. Repeat with the
  remainder of the codcakes. In a large skillet melt together the
  butter and the oil. Fry half of the codcakes in the skillet about 3-4
  minutes per side. MSN, the results should be fairly brown. Drain the
  fishcakes on paper towels. Repeat with the remainder of the cakes.
   Serve warm with the Jalapeno Tartar Sauce and fresh lemon or lime
  wedges. MSN= 2/3 cup of the mix = 4" patties.

      Title: FRESH ASPARAGUS SALAD WITH LEMON DIJON VINAIG
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Asparagus, tough ends
           -removed
      1 md Lemon (for both juice and
           -peel)
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      2 tb Corn or canola oil
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 ts Dijon mustard
      1 sl Bacon, cooked until crisp
           -and crumbled coarsely
      4    Dry-cured black olives,
           -pitted
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Bring a large pot of water to a boil and blanch the asparagus (cook
  until tender but still bright green, 4-5 minutes). Remove with tongs
  and immediately plunge into ice-cold water to stop the cooking and
  preserve the color. Drain completely and arrange the asparagus on two
  salad plates.
  
  Remove half the lemon peel and cut into extremely thin strips. Boil
  for 1-2 minutes; drain. Squeeze 3 tablespoons juice from the lemon.
  Put the juice and boiled peel in a jar. Add the oils, salt, pepper
  and Dijon mustard. Shake vigorously to combine. (This makes 3/4 cup
  dressing. Refrigerate the unused portion for future salads.)
  
  At serving time, spoon some vinaigrette over the asparagus. (Never let
  asparagus sit in vinegar- or lemon based dressings; it turns an ugly
  olive drab.) Sprinkle the crumbled bacon and pitted olives over the
  top, along with a grind of pepper.

      Title: FRESH ASPARAGUS WITH LEMON BUTTER SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Asparagus, Fresh
    1/4 lb Butter
      3 tb Lemon Juice, Concentrate
      1 tb Parsley, Chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Tabasco Sauce
 
  Select fresh asparagus for crispness and young tender pencil sized
  stalks are ideal. Wash asparagus under cold running water. Snap off
  the lower end of each stalk with your fingers. Let the stalk break
  where it wants to. This will leave only the tender portion of the
  asparagus. Young tender stalks can be cooked in a steamer for 5-7
  minutes, the more mature stalks for 7-10 minutes. DO NOT OVERCOOK
  asparagus. It will lose flavor and nutrients if overcooked. Prior to
  cooking the asparagus, prepare the lemon butter sauce. This is enough
  sauce for 1 to 1-1/2 pounds of asparagus. Combine the butter, lemon
  juice, parsley, salt and Tabasco Sauce in a small saucepan and heat
  until hot. DO NOT BOIL. Pour the heated sauce over the cooked
  asparagus and serve. From: Syd's Cookbook.

      Title: FRESH BASIL SAUCE
 Categories: Seasonings, Italian, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/4 c  White wine vinegar or
    1/4 c  Basil vinegar
    1/4 c  Dry white wine
      1 tb Shallot; finely chopped
    1/2 ts Whole black peppercorns
      1 tb Fresh basil; chopped
      1 c  Unsalted butter
      3    Egg yolks; at room temp.
           Salt; to taste
      1 ts Fresh basil (up to 2 ts.)
           -- chopped
 
  "This buttery egg sauce is fashioned after classical French
  bearnaise, but substitutes basil for tarragon."
  
  Boil together first 5 ingredients in a small heavy saucepan until
  liquid is reduced to about 2 tb. Remove from heat; set aside.
  
  In a clean saucepan, melt butter; remove from heat when it begins to
  bubble.  Meanwhile, place egg yolks in container of blender. Set a
  small sieve over opening and pour basil-shallot reduction through
  this and into the blender jar.  Press solids with back of a spoon to
  extract all juices, then discard solids.
  
  Place blender top on and blend briefly at high speed. Remove small
  inner cap from the lid.  With blender running at high speed, add hot
  butter in a thin, slow stream. Blend until mixture thickens and
  machine begins to sound clogged.  Add salt and chopped basil to taste.
  
  Serve warm.  (To keep ahead of time, place near a warm stove element
  or in a pan of warm water.)  Good over grilled hamburgers and baked
  potatoes; also delicious with green vegetables, poultry, fish and egg
  dishes.
  
  For Bearnaise Sauce:  Substitute tarragon vinegar for basil vinegar
  and chopped fresh tarragon for basil.
  
  Yield:  About one cup.

           -julienned (do not peel)
    1/2 ts Celery seed
 
  Roast the anaheim chiles, then peel, seed and dice them.
  
  Process the corn in a food processor until it resembles a puree,
  about 2 minutes.  Scrape down with a spatula and process for another
  minute.
  
  In a bowl, mix together the corn puree,the chopeed chiles, salt, and
  pepper.  Slowly add the flour, small amounts at a time, while
  stirring.
  
  In a medium saucepan, heat the clarified butter over high heat. Using
  a large cook's spoon or serving spoon, gently drop spoonfuls of the
  batter into the hot butter.  When the edges are brown after about 2
  minutes, turn the fritters over and cook another 2 minutes.  Remove
  the fritters and allow them to drain on paper towels.
  
  In another saucepan over medium high heat, melt the unsalted butter,
  add the apples and the celery seed, and saute about 3 minutes, until
  they begin to soften.  Serve hot with the fritters.
  
  *** NOTE *** To make clarified butter, melt butter over low heat,
  then set aside to cool. When the milk solids have separated fro mthe
  liquid, skim the top layer of froth from the butter with a spoon and
  discard. Pour off the clarified butter, discarding the residue on the
  bottom.
  
  Although Native Americans dry many foods for use throughout the year,
  they always prefer the fresh taste of foods recently harvested:  the
  corn is sweeter, the chiles spicier, and the apples are tart.  During
  the late summer, when theser fruits and vegetables are harvested in
  the Northern parts of Arizona and New Mexico, a dish such as this,
  which combines an array of different flavors, is a fall favorite.

  NOTE:  *cobs reserved and broken into 3-inch lengths
  
  Combine corn and 1 cup half and half in a blender or food processor
  and process in short bursts to finely chop corn. Add corn mixture to
  a saucepan along with remaining cream, corn cobs and vanilla bean.
  Bring to a simmer over moderate heat.
  
  While corn mixture is heating, beat together the egg yolks, sugar,
  honey, zest and chile in a bowl until well combined. Remove and
  discard cobs from corn-cream mixture and whisk mixture into egg yolk
  mixture in a slow steady stream. Remove vanilla bean, split it and
  scrape seeds into mixture. (Rinse vanilla bean and use to flavor
  sugar if desired!).
  
  Return mixture to pan and cook custard over low heat, stirring
  constantly, until it just begins to thicken (approximately 180
  degrees). Be careful not to boil or eggs will curdle. Strain through
  a fine mesh sieve, chill and then freeze in an ice cream freezer
  according to manufacturer's directions.

 Categories: Personal, Better
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------

MMMMM----------------------ANTIAGING CREAM---------------------------
      1 oz Glycerin
      1 oz Witch hazel
    1/2 oz Rose water
      3 tb Honey
      3 tb Wheat germ oil

MMMMM------------------SOOTHING CUCUMBER CREAM-----------------------
      1    Whole cucumber, unpeeled
    1/2 oz White paraffin
      2 oz Sweet almond oil
 
  ** This cream is soothing for simple cases of windburn, sunburn,
  insect bites, or poison ivy and it even calms the ravages of air
  pollution if you apply it right after clensing. As with the creation
  of any creams, remember the lessions learned from making mayonnaise,
  slowly, very slowly, add the oil, drop by drop to the wax.
  
  Antiaging Cream: Smooth a bit of this antiwrinkle prep every night
  around the tender skin of your face and neck. Combine ingreds in a
  class or ceramic bowl and gently whisk until thoroughly combined.
  Store in tightly sealed container at room temp. It should last for at
  least 1 mo which is about when you will want to make up a new batch.
  To Use: Massage into skin around eyes and mouth using a circular and
  upward motion. This motion will counteract the natural droop of
  gravity.
  
  Soothing Cucumber Cream: Cut cucumber into chunks and puree in food
  processor. Strain through strainer lined with cheesecloth. Melt wax in
  small bowl in the top of a glass or enamel double boiler over med
  heat. As soon as the wax is melted, slowly add oil, stirring gently.
  Add strained cucumber and blend thoroughly. Remove the pot from heat
  and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let mixtue cool very slowly to
  prevent crystals from forming in the wax. Stir mixture once or twice
  until cool. When completely cool and smooth, store in airtight glass
  container in refrigerator. Will keep 60 days. 4 oz Big Savings Typed

      Title: FRESH FIELDS' GUIDE TO CHILI PEPPERS
 Categories: Text, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Text file
 
  Habanero -  HHHOTTT!!!  Would you believe 50 times hotter than a
  jalapeno?
  
  Scotch Bonnet -  Almost as hot as a habanero, this pepper is used in
  Caribbean cooking.  It has a tropical, fruity flavor.
  
  Jalapeno -  Our most popular pepper.  Look for jalapenos that are deep
  green.
  
  Anaheim -  These long, green chilies are relatively mild (for a chili
  pepper, that is).  They are the variety most often used in packaged
  and prepared foods.
  
  Dried Peppers:
  
  Dried Ancho Chilies -  These are the sweetest of the chilies and are
  ideal for sauces and moles.
  
  Dried Habanero Chilies -  These are just as hot dried as fresh!
  
  Dried Chipotle Chilies - Also called Ahumado, these are smoked dried
  jalapeno chilies that are excellent in seasoning soup and salsa.
  
  Dried Japones Chilies -  These are small, very hot peppers grown in
  China and Japan.  Use them in your favorite stir fry.
  
  Dried Pastilla Chilies -  These mild to medium hot chilies have a rich
  flavor that is excellent when ground and used in sauces.

  paper. Prepare angel food cake mix as label directs, but spread
  batter evenly in prepared jelly-roll pan. Bake cake 20 minutes or
  until golden. Cover large wire rack with sheet of waxed paper. When
  cake is done, with small spatula, loosen it from sides of pan; invert
  onto waxed paper on rack. Lift off pan; peel off paper. Cool cake
  completely, then return to clean jelly-roll pan or large tray. Cover
  cake if not using right away. To serve: Spread top of cake with about
  half of chilled fruit sauce. Slice peaches and strawberries. Arrange
  peaches, strawberries, and blueberries on cake; brush fruit with
  remaining fruit sauce. This cake is absolutely delicious and looks

      Title: FRESH GINGER MUFFINS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      2 oz Unpeeled ginger root
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Lemon zest
           - with some white pith
      3 tb Sugar
      8 tb Butter; room temperature

      1 c  Buttermilk
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Baking soda
 
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 375F. Grease the muffin tins. Cut the unpeeled
  ginger until it is in tiny pieces; or hand chop into fine pieces.
  (You should have 1/4 cup; it is better to have too much ginger than
  too little.) Put the ginger and 1/4 cup sugar in a small skillet or
  pan and cook over medium heat until the sugar has melted and the
  mixture is hot. Don't walk away from the pan--this cooking takes only
  a couple of minutes. Remove from the stove and let the ginger mixture
  cool. Put the lemon zest and 3 tablespoons sugar in the food
  processor and process until the lemon peel is in small bits; or chop
  the lemon zest and pith by hand and then add the sugar. Add the lemon
  mixture to the ginger mixture. Stir and set aside. Put the butter in
  a mixing bowl and beat a second or two, add the remaining 1/2 cup
  sugar, and beat until smooth. Add the eggs and beat well. Add the
  buttermilk and mix until blended. Add the flour, salt and baking
  soda. Beat until smooth. Add the ginger-lemon mixture and mix well.
  Spoon the batter into the muffin tins so that each cup is 3/4 full.
  Bake 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm.

  remove from the heat. Skim the foam off the top of the mixture and
  pour into clean, sterilized jars. Seal with parrafin, if desired, and
  allow to set overnight.
  
  *** NOTE *** If the herb jelly does not set overnight, remove the
  parrafin and reheat the mixture over high heat. Bring to a hard
  rolling boil 2 minutes, repour into the jars, and reseal. Because you
  are working with herbs and not fruit, sometimes the pectin doesn't
  react the first time and needs to be reboiled.

      1    Or 2 lemons, well scrubbed
           -and
           Patted dry
    1/2 c  (1 stick) butter, at room
           Temperature
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      2 lg Eggs
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Plain yogurt or buttermilk
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
      2 tb Granulated sugar
 
  Heat oven to 375 F. Grease muffin cups or use foil or paper baking
  cups. Finely chop the ginger. Finely grate the lemon peel so you have
  2 tablespoons.
  
  In a large bowl, beat butter and the 1 cup sugar with a wooden spoon
  or electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time.
  Add ginger and lemon peel.
  
  Stir baking soda into yogurt or buttermilk; it will start to bubble
  and rise up.
  
  Fold flour into ginger mixture one third at a time, alternating with
  the yogurt. When well blended, scoop into muffin cups. Bake 18 to 20
  minutes, or until lightly browned and springy to the touch.
  
  While muffins bake, mix lemon juice and the 2 tablespoons sugar in a
  small dish. Stir until sugar dissolves.
  
  When muffins are baked, remove from oven and let cool 3 to 5 minutes
  in pan. Remove from pan and dip top and bottom into lemon juice and
  sugar mixture.
  
  Note: If you have a food processor use this method: Peel one lemon
  with a vegetable peeler. Put ginger, lemon peel, and the 1 cup sugar
  into the food processor, fitted with a steel blade. Process 1 to 2
  minutes, scraping sides once, until lemon peel and giner are very
  finely chopped. Add butter; process about 30 seconds until creamy.
  Add eggs, one at a time, processing briefly after each addition.
  Scrape mixture into a large bowl; if it looks curdled, don't worry.
  Add baking soda, yogurt, and flour and continue as above.

      Title: FRESH LOTUS ROOT SALAD
 Categories: Chinese, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Fresh lotus root
    1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger
      4 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb White vinegar
    1/2 tb Asian sesame oil
      1 tb Chopped fresh coriander
           Toasted black or white
           -sesame seeds for garnish
 
  If you haven't tried fresh lotus roots do yourselves a favor and pick
  up some from an Oriental market.  They look like nothing so much as
  strings of vegetable sausages a few inches long and about three
  inches in diameter. The flavor is somewhat reminiscent of a water
  chestnut as is the texture++very fresh, crisp and good. When sliced,
  they have an intriguing, lacy cross section that comes from air
  channels in the root. Lotus root is also available canned and it's
  not bad++not as good as fresh, but quite acceptable.  They can better
  than water chestnuts and retain more of the characteristics of the
  fresh root than do water chestnuts. Lotus roots make a nice addition
  to soups too.
  
  BTW, it's considered bad form by Asian grocers to break up the hands
  of roots.  They're not that expensive and you'll probably use all you
  buy anyway.
  
  Rinse lotus roots with cold water.  Trim and discard both ends of the
  bulb. With a vegetable peeler, pool the skin. Diagonally cut thee
  root into 1/8 inch thick slices; immediately plunge slices into
  acidulated water. Drain.
  
  Put lotus roots into a heat-proof bowl.  Pour enough boiling water to
  cover; let sit for 5 minutes.  Drain. Rinse with cold water. Pat dry.
  refrigerate until chilled.
  
  For the dressing; in bowl, combine thoroughly the ginger, sugar soy
  sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and coriander. Put lotus root slices into
  a shallow bowl; pour dressing over lotus roots. Arrange on individual
  salad plates, garnish with sesame seeds.  Serve chilled.
  
  Serves 8.

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground pork, browned and
           -fat drained
    1/2 lb Shrimp, shelled (save the
           -shells!)
      3 ea Firm tofu, fried and cut
           -into cubes
      1 lg Onion, sliced
      3 ea Cloves garlic, crushed
      1 lb Turnips, cut into strips
      1 lb Potatoes, cut into cubes
      2 lb Pole beans, cleaned and cut
           -crosswise
      1 bn Lettuce (not iceberg)
      2 tb Soy sauce
      4 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Fish sauce ("patis"),
           -optional
      2 tb Accent salt, optional
           Lumpia wrappers
 
  For the stock, boil the shrimp shells in 1 1/2 cups water. Saute the
  garlic, onions, ground port, shrimp, and tofu. Add the potatoes and
  1/2 cup stock. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the
  beans and cook for another 5 - 10 minutes. Then add turnips, soy
  sauce, vegetable oil, salt and pepper (to taste), and fish sauce.
  Continue to stir and cook for 5 more minutes. Drain and save the
  broth for the dipping sauce. Allow the mixture to cool. Separate the
  lumpia wrappers carefully. Line one end of the wrapper with a small
  piece of lettuce so that the lettuce pokes out a little bit - this is
  the top of the roll. Use 2 tbsp. of the mixture for filling (this
  will be a fatter roll than for fried lumpia) on top of the lettuce
  and roll the wrapper. Close the bottom end of the roll by folding it
  and securing it with a little water. Wrap each roll with wax paper.
  Makes 2 dozen, depending on size of roll. Spread garlic sauce (below)
  liberally over lumpia. FRESH LUMPIA

 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2    Eggs
 
  Place flour in work bowl of food processor fitted with steel blade.
  Add eggs and process until dough comes together and forms ball that
  rides around on top of blade. If mixture is too dry and fails to form
  ball, slowly add just enough water to bring ball together, no more
  than 1 tablespoon.
  
  Dough ball should be slightly sticky. If too sticky and soft, add
  flour 1 teaspoon at time until texture is correct.
  
  Knead dough by running processor. Ball with ride around on top of
  blade, becoming more and more smooth. When smooht enough, remove from
  processor. Wrap in plastic wrap. Let stand at least 45 minutes.
  
  Roll dough out in pasta machine. Divide in quarters and work with 1
  portion at time, keeping remainder wrapped in plastic wrap. Flatten
  dough, then run through machine on widest setting. Fold double and
  run through again, folded edge first. Repeat 2 or 3 times. Fold
  double again, and run through sideways. Repeat 2 or 3 more times.
  Dough will change from fairly sticky and possibly slightly dimpled on
  1 side to satiny and smooth. Sheet should be as wide as baking dish
  (if not, layer dish with 2 sheets rather than 1).
  
  Change pasta machine to next-narrower setting. Run dough through
  machine once. Repeat until next-to-last setting. Before rolling out
  at next-to-last setting, cut pasta sheet in half. After rolling out
  at next-to-last setting, lay pasta sheet on lightly floured dish
  towel and cover with another dish towel.
  
  Repeat until all dough has been rolled out.

      Title: FRESH ROSEMARY ONION FOCACCIA ABM
 Categories: Breads, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Water
    1/3 c  Olive Oil
    1/3 c  Rosemary Leaves
      2 ts Salt
      3 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Cornmeal
      1 tb Yeast
      1 lg Spanish Onions; cooked in
      2 tb Olive Oil

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      2 tb Olive Oil
           Coarse Salt
           Ground Pepper
 
  Place all dough ingredients except cooked onion in the machine,
  program for knead and first rise. Press start. Strain onions and
  return liquid. At end of final knead, add the onion (without liquid)
  to the machine. Restart and knead only until the onion is roughly
  mixed in. The dough will be wet and onion will remain in clumps,
  sticking out of the dough. Turn the dough out on a well-floured board
  and knead briefly by hand to form a ball. Oil a pizza pan or baking
  sheet. Place the dough on the prepared pan and pat into a 12" disk.
  Coat the top of the dough with the onion juices. Cover with plastic
  wrap and let it rise either at room temperature until doubled in
  bulk, or in the refrigerator overnight. A long cold rise in the
  refrigerator will result in a more flavorful bread with a heartier
  interior. Preheat the oven to 450oF. with the rack in the center
  position.
  
  Just before baking the dough, use your fingertips to gently make
  indentations in the surface. Drizzle on the oil and then sprinkle
  with salt and pepper. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce to oven to
  350oF. and bake for another 12 to 15 minutes, or until the focaccia
  is golden brown. Serve hot or at room temperature.

      Title: FRESH SALMON PATE
 Categories: Barry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Boned and skinned salmon
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground white pepper
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
    1/2 ts Ground mace or nutmeg
    1/2 ts Ground bay leaves
    1/2 lb Butter
           Fresh lemon juice
           Chopped parsley or chives
           -for decoration
 
  Check that as many bones as possible really have been removed, then
  put the salmon into a large saucepan of cold water with a pinch of
  salt and a squeeze of lemon juice.
  
  Bring it to the boil, then turn the heat down and poach gently for 10
  to 15 minutes - one large piece of salmon will take longer than a
  couple of smaller pieces.
  
  Turn off the heat and allow to cool in the water for another 10
  minutes. If the skin is still on, you will find it lifts away
  effortlessly at this point.
  
  Put the salmon into a big bowl and mash it with a fork, or use a food
  processor. gently melt the butter in a saucepan and add to it all the
  other seasonings - the ground bayleaves, white pepper, cloves, mace
  or nutmeg and the salt. Stir thoroughly and pour it into the salmon.
  If you are using a food processor, give it another quick whizz,
  otherwise stir with a fork until it is thoroughly amalgamated.
  
  If you want to serve the salmon pate in slices, spoon the mixture
  into a loaf shaped container lined with cling film, otherwise put it
  into a round bowl of souffle dish.
  
  Smooth the top and sprinkle with a little parsley or chives for a
  lovely contrasting colour, and chill in the fridge for at least four
  hours.
  
  Serve with lots of crusty french bread.

      Title: FRESH SPINACH PRESTO SAUCE
 Categories: Cookbook by, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        1 c  yellow onion -- chopped
      1/2 c  olive oil -- divided
        3    cloves garlic -- minced
        3 c  fresh spinach leaves --
  :          packed
        2 ts dried basil
      1/2 ts salt
      1/4 c  Parmesan cheese -- grated
  
  Saute the onion and garlic in about 4 tablespoons of the olive oil
  until onion is soft and transparent; remove from heat and cool
  slightly. Spoon the onion and oil mixture into a blender or food
  processor. Add spinach, basil and salt. Process until mixture is
  finely chopped. With motor running, pour the remaining 1/4 cup of
  olive oil in a slow but steady stream through the feeder hole. Blend
  to a coarse puree, then stop the motor, add cheese and process for
  just a moment more. Yields 1-1/4 cups sauce.
  
  She developed this sauce to use on fettuccini because her family
  doesn't like classic pesto. "...I found myself dipping into it
  serendipitously throughout the week. One night I placed dollops of it
  atop of our grilled chicken breasts. Another time it became the basis
  for a quick pasta salad. It even worked as a sandwich spread with
  sun-dried tomatoes, Swiss cheese, and pickled Greek pepperoncini. Try
  it as an accent for pork chops or fish filets too.
  
  "This is a delectable, speedy, make-ahead sauce. Refrigerated, it
  maintains good color and flavor for at least a week. It could
  probably go longer, but I haven't managed to leave a batch alone long
  enough to be sure." Source: Oregon food writer and artist: Jan

      Title: FRESH STRAWBERRY SMOOTHIES-NEW ORLEANS JAZZ &
 Categories: Beverages, Fruit
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
     30    Fresh medium-sized Louisiana
           Strawberries, hulled and
           Washed well.
      4 tb Honey (preferred) or sugar
      8 oz Water
           Crushed ice
 
  Terry Marks and Joe Gallo are both native New Orleanians. Joe's
  family was raised in Independence, Louisiana on their own strawberry
  farm. Terry and Joe own and operate GM Signs in Metairie as their
  primary business, but look forward every year to getting the
  concession trailer ready for the Jazz Fest. Joe's mother Frances and
  a host of Joe's aunts, uncles and other relatives and friends work
  for many hours before and during the Fest preparing the
  chocolate-dipped strawberries. At the Fest, Joe, Terry, their wives
  Dale Gallo and Linda Marks, and many friends and relatives work
  hauling ice, restocking supplies, making the Smoothies, and serving
  customers. In a Vitamix machine or blender, place strawberries, honey
  and water. Blend at high speed while adding crushed ice to achieve
  desired consistency. Smoothie should be stiff enough to hold a straw,
  but still be pourable. It takes a little practice to get it just
  right. This will yield 4 to 5 (8 oz.) drinks. Walt MM

      1 ea Head fresh dill; minced
      2 ea Garlic cloves; minced
 
  Combine gravy mix, (or cornstarch/bullion) onion, dill and garlic.
   NOTE: You need the sauce thickening capabilities because of the
  amount of moisture created by the squash and tomatoes as they cook.
  Do not add extra moisture as with prepared sauce, and make sure you
  bake it without covering the baking pan in order for excess moisture
  to evaporate during baking.
  
  Layer summer squash on bottom of baking dish.
  
  Sprinkle seasoning mixture over squash.
  
  Layer grated cheese over seasoning mixture.
  
  Top with layer of sliced tomatoes.
  
  Bake, uncovered at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours, or until squash is
  as tender as you prefer.

MMMMM-----------------ALL QUANTITIES APPROXIMATE----------------------
      8    To 16 Tomatilloes depending
           On size.
     12    Chiles (2_Serranos +
      2    _Jalapenos + 8_Piquins) I
           Typically use
           The serranos and jalapenos
           Green and the piquins red.
      4    Cloves Garlic
      1 sm Onion, really small, or half

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Cilantro
 
  Roast above ingredients in a[n oil-free] cast iron pan, turning
  occasionally.  Leave husks on tomatillos while you roast 'em. The
  husks will be nicely blackened, the skins translucent, and the fruits
  soft when they're done.  [Let me add: the goal is to blacken the skin
  while doing the least tomatillo-exploding that you can. That way they

  jars. Seal. Cool on rack to room temperature. Store in refrigerator

      1 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Butter
           Salt; to taste
      6 c  Vegetable broth

           -ripe tomatoes, 1 tb olive
           -oil & 2-3 clove garlic,chpd
      2 c  Arborio rice
    3/4 c  Dry white wine
      1 tb Parsley, fresh; chopped *
      1 tb Basil, fresh; chopped *
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese; grated

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Parmesan cheese
           Basil, fresh; slivered
           Pine nuts; toasted
 
  * use up to 2 tablespoons of chopped herbs
  
  In a large non-stick saute pan, saute the onion in the olive oil and
  butter, with a dash of salt, until it begins to turn golden. In
  separate skillets, heat the vegetable broth and the tomato sauce, and
  keep them both just below a simmer.
  
  If you are starting with fresh tomatoes: Scald and peel them, and
  chop them or process them in a blender for a few seconds. Heat a
  tablespoon of olive oil in a non-stick pan, saute the chopped garlic
  in it for 2 minutes, then add the tomatoes and cook them down for
  about 15 minutes.
  
  Add the rice to the sauteed onion and stir it gently in the pan for
  about 2 minutes. Pour in the white wine and stir as it is absorbed.
  
  Add a soup ladle of the heated broth and stir, keeping the mixture
  just at a simmer. Keep stirring until the broth is nearly all
  absorbed into the rice, then add a ladle of tomato sauce and the
  chopped herbs, and stir until that is nearly absorbed. Continue this
  way, alternating broth and sauce until the sauce is used up, then
  carry on the with broth until the rice is al dente. This process will
  take about 25 minutes, and at the end a creamy sauce will form around
  the rice grains that are tender but firm.
  
  At the moment the rice is no longer crunchy, stir in a last ladle of
  hot broth, and the grated Parmesan cheese, and serve the risotto at
  once. Scatter slivered basil and toasted pine nuts over each serving,
  and pass additional Parmesan.

  Hill and Barclay write: "This tomato sauce, made without the usual
  paste, is wonderful to keep on hand in the freezer for pasta,
  omelets, and grilled meats and poultry."
  
  Heat olive oil in large skillet over moderately high heat; saute
  onion and garlic until softened.  Add tomatoes gradually, keeping
  heat as high as possible without browning. Stir in herbs, wine and
  any reserved tomato juice; reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20
  minutes, or until vegetables are softened and fragrant. Add more wine
  or water if needed, to prevent sticking and maintain desired
  consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Yield: About 3 cups.

      8 tb Finely chopped fresh dill

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
      8 c  Cooked rice

  * Bouquet Garni - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
  sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
  thyme and 1 t fresh marjoram. Leave the string long enough to hang the
  garni in the pot and tie the string to the pot handle for easy
  removal. Drop the tomatoes into boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and
  peel. Chop coarsely and reserve.  In a large saucepan, heat 1 T of
  butter and oil. Add the onion and cook over low heat until lightly
  browned. Add the remaining butter. When the butter is melted, add the
  flour and cook until it is golden brown.  Be careful not to burn it!
  Add the chopped tomatoes stirring constantly.  Then add the boiling
  water, Bouquet Garni, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer the soup for
  35 minutes. Remove the soup from the heat. Remove the Bouquet. Cool
  the soup and puree it in the blender. If it seems too thick, thin it
  out with a little chicken stock or water. Serve the soup in
  individual bowls, each topped with 1 T sour cream and a sprinkling of
  dill. Notes: For a hearty soup, omit the sour cream and substitute
  cooked rice.  From "Seasonal Kitchen, a Celebration of Fresh Foods"

  chocolate or other ice cream flavors for the vanilla. It might not be
  the traditional way, but it'll still be good.. and different.

      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil

           -quartered lengthwise (see
           -recipe)
      1 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley
 
  Fresh tuna is readily available at all fish markets and in most
  supermarkets today. The freshest, best tuna has deep red flesh. If
  the tuna is turning dark around the edges, don't buy itQit's not
  fresh.
  
  1. Preheat oven to 350!F.
  
  2 Cut off about 1/4 inch from the top of each clove of garlic;
  discard. Place garlic cloves in a small ramekin. Drizzle with white
  wine and I teaspoon pure olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper,
  cover with foil and bake for 1 hour, or until garlic is soft. Remove
  and cool to room temperature.
  
  3. Sprinkle both sides of tuna with black pepper. Heat remaining 2
  tablespoons pure olive oil in a non stick skillet. Sear tuna over
  medium-high heat and cook for 3 minutes per side for medium rare.
  Remove from pan, cool and cut crosswise into 8 thin slices. Reserve.
  
  4 Slice the top third off each roll, lengthwise; reserve tops. Hollow
  out the center of each roll. Brush insides with the extra-virgin
  olive oil. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves from their skins and
  spread over the inside of each roll.
  
  5. To assemble sandwiches, lay 2 slices of tuna along bottom of each
  roll; cover with slice of onion. Next, lay string beans lengthwise.
  Top each with a slice of tomato and roasted pepper, pressing down on
  ingredients. Sprinkle evenly with black pepper and parsley. Cover
  rolls with reserved tops; press down again. To ensure that the
  sandwich is perfectly moist, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and
  refrigerate 2 to 3 hours before serving. From the files of Al Rice,

  In a large mixing bowl, combine turnips, celery, pimento, olives,
  salt, black pepper and mayonnaise. Toss to mix well; taste and adjust
  seasonings. Add pepper sauce and garlic powder, and toss to blend.
  Best made a day ahead. NOTE: The original recipe does not call for
  pepper sauce or garlic, and yields a light crisp salad without them.
  But, if you prefer a bit more flavor, the pepper sauce and garlic
  powder add zest without overpowering the delicious taste of the fresh
  turnip.

  gently to form rope 1/2-inch thick; moisten ends and press together
  to form bagels. Place bagels on floured cookie sheets. Let stand
  covered 20 minutes.
  
  Heat 1 gallon water to boiling in large saucepan; reduce heat to
  medium. Place 3 or 4 bagels in saucepan; simmer uncovered 7 minutes
  (no longer). Drain on towel. Repeat with remaining bagels.

  top. Cover and cook slowly for about 40 minutes until the chicken is

  this time shake the pan frequently and do not lift the lid except to
  stir the ingredients twice. Correct the seasoning if necessary and
  serve very hot with plain boiled potatoes.

      Title: FRICASSEE DE POULET A LA POITEVINE (CHICKEN I
 Categories: French, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 kg (2 lb) onions
      1    Chicken (1.5-2 kg [3-4 lb])
           Salt, black pepper
     25 g  (1 oz) butter
      2 tb Flour
 
  The regional recipes of France have evolved throughout time to
  complement the local wines.  Hence the rich recipes of Burgundy,
  Poitou and Vendee produce wines of lesser glory and their recipes, in
  consequence, are more homely-but none the less appetizing when served
  with the 'little' wines of the region.
  
  Peel the onions, quarter them and slice thickly.
  
  Wipe the chicken inside and out with a cloth wrung out in boiling
  water. Cut into 10 serving pieces:  2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings
  and 2 breasts halved. Season each piece on both sides. Melt the
  butter in a sauteuse or large frying pan over low heat and when
  foaming add the chicken and colour to the golden stage on both sides.
  Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon, cover and keep hot.  Add
  the onions to the fats in the pan, season, increase the heat to
  medium, mix well and colour to the golden stage, moving them around
  with a wooden spatula to prevent sticking and colouring too fast.
  
  Sprinkle with half the flour and mix in thoroughly before adding the
  remainder.  Cook for a few moments, stirring constantly, reduce the
  heat to low, add the vinegar, stir well and arrange the chicken on

  tender and the moisture from the onions has made the sauce. During
  this time shake the pan frequently and do not lift the lid except to

  Makes 6 servings.

  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Rinse the chicken pieces dry, pat dry and
  sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt the butter over low heat in a
  large covered casserole dish or Dutch oven on top of the stove. Add
  the chicken pieces and cook on all sides without browning, about 7
  minutes. The chicken should not be crowded, so perform this operation
  in batches, if necessary. Remove pieces to a plate as they are done.
  When all chicken is done, add the onions, carrots, celery, bay leaves
  and thyme and cook about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the
  vegetables and cook, stirring for 30 seconds. Add the stock, milk and
  nutmeg. Increase heat to high, cover and bring to a boil. Replace the
  thighs and drumsticks, cover and place casserole in the oven for 25
  minutes. Add the reserved breasts and cook for another 15 minutes.
  Remove the casserole from the oven, remove the chicken pieces from
  the casserole and set them aside. Strain the sauce through a fine
  sieve and discard onions, carrots, celery and herbs. Keep the chicken
  pieces warm in the turned-off oven while finishing the sauce. Place
  strained sauce in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook until
  stewing liquid is thick enough to cling to a wooden spoon. To serve,
  arrange the chicken in a serving casserole or on a deep serving
  platter and ladle the sauce over it. Accompany the fricassee with
  noodles or rice pilaf. Refrigerate the meat and sauce separately for
  up to 3 days. Freeze the meat and sauce separately in 2 batches for
  up to 3 months. Makes 2 Batches, Serving 3 to 4 Each

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Bacon; sliced
      2 lb Onions
      2 lb Apples; tart, chopped
      2 tb Sugar, brown
 
  Salt pork may be substituted for the bacon.
  
  Fry bacon slices in 12" skillet until brown and crisp. Set aside on a
  warm serving platter.
  
  While meat is frying, peel onions, leaving stems to hold for slicing.
  To prevent your eyes from watering, hold a slice of bread in your
  teeth while you slice the onions as thin as possible. Discard stems.
  
  Core apples and cut crosswise in circles about 1/4" thick. Apple
  skins help the slices hold their shape and add color to the dish, so
  don't peel unless skins are tough or scarred.
  
  Drain all but 1 tb fat from skillet, then add onion slices. Cook over
  medium-high heat about 3 minutes. Cover with apple slices in an even
  layer. Sprinkle brown sugar over all, cover skillet, & cook until
  tender, a few minutes more.  Stir only to prevent scorching. Remove
  to warm plate with bacon slices.
  
  This is a "country" dish, seldom mentioned in cookbooks but recalled
  by many oldtimers.  Some feel sugar is essential; others call it a
  "sin." If you share Almanzo's enthusiasm you might also like to try
  fried apples'n'onions with fried potatoes for breakfast sometime.
  
  Here is the recipe Fried Apples'n'Onions from the Little House
  Cookbook.

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 c  Mayonnaise
           Grated zest of 1 lemon
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Chopped dill pickle
      1 tb Spicy Creole mustard
      1 tb Drained capers (optional)
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce

MMMMM----------------------------FISH---------------------------------
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      4    Large eggs
      1 c  Yellow cornmeal
      3 tb OLd Bay Seasoning
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      2 lb Catfish filets
           Lemon wedges, for garnish
 
      Make the remoulade sauce: In a small bowl, stir together all the
  ingredients until well mixed. Cover, and refrigerate for at least one
  hour or overnight.
      Prepare the catfish: Get everything ready before starting your
  fish fry: Place the flour on a plate. Beat the eggs well in a medium
  bowl. In a large bowl, whisk the cornmeal, Old Bay Seasoning, salt,
  and garlic powder to combine. Heat the oil in a large skillet over
  medium heat until very hot but not smoking. Preheat the oven to 200.
      The procedure will go smoothest if you reserve one hand for
  dredging the catfish in the flour and dipping it in the eggs, and the
  other for coating in the seasoned cornmeal. In batches, dredge the
  catfish in flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the catfish in the
  eggs, coating on both sides. Then dredge the dipped catfish in the
  seasoned cornmeal, patting the coating so it will adhere. Slip the
  coated catfish into the oil, and cook over medium heat, turning once,
  until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes total. Using a
  slotted spatula, transfer the browned catfish to a paper towel-lined
  baking sheet to drain, and keep warm in the oven while continuing
  with the remaining catfish.
      Serve the catfish as soon as possible, with the remoulade sauce
  on the side. Garnish with the lemon wedges.

  Put a cup of flour seasoned with salt and pepper in a large, brown

  Chicken and Pan Gravy. This was how my grandmother made fried chicken
  and it was indisputably the BEST in the world! I do it exactly as she
  did, but still can't get it that good... This should make a nice,
  crispy batch of chicken.  If you cover while frying, it will probably

      Title: FRIED CHICKEN A L'ITALIENNE
 Categories: Italian, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Chicken, cut into 8 pieces
           Tomato Batter
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Oil
           Tomato Sauce
 
  Rather suspiciously, this dish was also know as fried chicken al la
  Mexicaine. The old-fashioned tomato sauce does not taste much like the
  tomato sauces we know today; it's tart and work better as a condiment
  on the side than as a sauce to be poured over (though it is exactly
  the sort of tomato sauce that was served on pasta 100 years ago).
  
  Serve with peas and mashed potatoes. From "The Original White House
  Cookbook" (1887), by Hugo Ziemann & Mrs. F.L. Gillette.
  
  Dip chicken pieces in Tomato Batter. In large skillet melt butter
  with oil. Add chicken pieces two at time and fry until brown (more

  Recipe by: Jim Maslanka <jmasl@FNBC.COM> Chicken: 2 whole chicken
  breasts, boned, skinned, and split; rinse and pat dry . Separate the
  tenderloins from each breast; you'll now have 8 pieces of chicken .
  Pound chicken flat to about 50% increase in size . Score meat with
  sharp knife in a 1/2 inch criss cross pattern
  
  Rub: . Toast dried peppers on a hot iron skillet; remove stem; slit
  and remove seeds . Place peppers in a pan; cover with water; bring to
  a boil; remove from heat; let stand for 1 hour. . Place all rub
  ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth; run mixture through
  a food mill (fine filter) if possible. Should be a thick paste.
  
  Coating: . Mix ingredients thoroughly.
  
  Preparation: . Lightly dust chicken meat on all sides with flour,
  allow to dry for 5 minutes. . With a butter knife, spread the ancho
  paste evenly on one side of the chicken pieces; rub into the scored
  pattern (should be enough paste to "hide" the chicken meat). .
  Sprinkle liberally with seasoned coating; pat it into the paste;
  allow to dry for 5 min. . Turn chicken pieces over and repeat the
  paste and coating process on other side of meat.
  
  . Pour 1 cup of olive oil into a hot iron skillet; add 1/4 stick of
  butter; reduce heat to medium. . Don't crowd the chicken in the pan
  (cook breasts first, followed by tenderloins); for each batch: cook,
  covered, for 5 minutes; turn the meat; cook for another 5 minutes. .
  Remove meat, place on a warming rack in a 300 degree oven. . Continue
  cooking remaining meat.
  
  I served this with a yellow corn and black bean salsa, cooked for
  about 5 minutes with onions, 1 tsp balsamic vinegar, and 1/4 cup
  chicken broth.

      Title: FRIED CHICKEN ROMAN STYLE (FROM ENGLAND)
 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Chicken cut into 6 serving
           Pieces
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 oz Butter
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 oz Parma ham or smoked ham in
           One piece, finely diced
      2 cl Garlic, finely crushed
      4    Sage leaves, crumbled
      4 oz Dry white wine (Frascati?)
      4 oz Dry marsala
      1 cn (14 oz) tomatoes, chopped
      1 oz Tomato puree
 
   Method ====== Heat the oil and butter in a wide, deep frying pan and
  briskly fry the chicken pieces, turning often, until golden brown all
  over. Pour off half the fat and add the pepper, the ham, garlic and
  sage leaves. Saute for a couple of minutes. Pour in the white wine
  and the marsala, bring to the boil and bubble gently for about a
  minute, then lower the heat and continue cooking over a medium heat
  until the wine has evaporated. Add the tomatoes to the pan with the
  tomato puree and stir well to blend in all the crispy bits and pan
  juices. Check seasoning - with the Parma ham you should not need salt
  ~ and continue cooking for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally
  to prevent burning, until the sauce has reduced by half. It should be
  thick and dark but not too plentiful. Transfer the chicken to a
  warmed earthenware serving dish and serve with a simple green
  vegetable or salad of mixed green leaves dressed with virgin olive
  oil and lemon juice. John Burden 2:\255/1

      4    Chicken legs with thighs
           -attached (about 2 1/2
           -pounds)
      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts White pepper

      3    Thin slices fresh ginger
           -root
      2 tb Rice wine
      3 c  Shredded iceberg lettuce
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Rice vinegar
      3 tb Chicken stock or broth
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Sesame oil
    1/3 c  Minced green onion, white
           -part only
      2 tb Minced pared fresh ginger
           -root
      2 tb Minced fresh parsley
      1 sm Egg white
      4 tb Cornstarch
      4 c  Vegetable oil
 
  This one is kinda unusual as it calls for frying up joined legs and
  thighs then cutting them into one inch bone-in slices after cooking.
  This is usually done with whole birds and I don't see why you
  couldn't use a whole chicken in this recipe.  You'll need a Chinese
  cleaver or a hefty chef's knife for the chopping.
  
  Three of the contributing chefs who created original recipes for the
  book are Japanese.  I understand that Chinese food is the favorite
  'gaijin' cuisine in Japan and Chinese places abound. Just an
  interesting tidbit...
  
  1.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; rub to coat evenly. Place
  chicken in non aluminum baking pan. Pound 2 onions and the sliced
  ginger root lightly with flat side of cleaver; chop coarsely and
  scatter over chicken.  Sprinkle chicken with rice wine.  Marinate at
  room temperature, turning chicken once, for 30 minutes.
  
  2.  Arrange lettuce on large serving platter. Refrigerate covered.
  
  3.  Mix sugar, vinegar, stock, soy sauce and sesame oil in small
  saucepan. Stir in minced onion, ginger and parsley.
  
  4.  Whisk egg white in small bowl until foamy and double in volume.
  Whisk in 2 tablespoons cornstarch. Reserve batter.
  
  5.  Heat wok over high heat for 20 seconds; add vegetable oil and
  heat to 350F.
  
  6.  Meanwhile, drain chicken; discard marinade.  Pat chicken dry with
  paper toweling; dust with 2 tablespoons cornstarch. Spread batter on
  areas of chicken not covered with skin, coating evenly.
  
  7.  Fry 2 chicken pieces at a time, turning once, until crispy and
  cooked through, 7 to 9 minutes.  (To test for doneness, pierce
  thickest part of drumstick to the bone with tip of knife; juices
  should run clear.) Drain chicken on paper toweling, keep warm in a
  200F oven. Repeat, frying remaining 2 chicken pieces.
  
  8.  Heat stock mixture over medium heat to simmering. Reduce heat to
  low; simmer for 1 minute.  Keep dressing hot.
  
  9.  Cut warm chicken into 1/2-inch wide slices; use a meat mallet or
  hammer to pound cleaver or sturdy chef's knife through bones.
  Reassemble chicken slices and place on bed of lettuce. Pour hot
  dressing over chicken. Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      1 tb Chopped lemon grass
      2 tb Chopped shallots
      1 tb Chopped garlic
      1 tb Yellow curry powder
 
  Mix together the corn, egg, curry paste, rice flour, soy sauce and 1
  teaspoon salt.  Shape the mixture with your hands to form circular
  cakes about 1 inch in diameter.
  
  Dip the cakes in the wheat flour and then fry immediately in the very
  hot oil.  (Do not fry more than 6 to 8 cakes at a time or they will
  not cook properly.)
  
  To make the sauce, bring to a boil the vinegar, water sugar, salt and
  chili.  Let it cool.
  
  Pound the peanuts and add to the cooled mixture. Lastly, add the
  cucumber.
  
  From "Discover Thai Cooking".  Pierre Chaslin, Piyatep Canungmai, Luca
  Invernizzi Tettoni Times Editions, Singapore, 1987.
  
  NOTE:  These little guys are tasty!  Scoop up some of the sauce on
  each one and wolf 'em down.  I've used plain curry powder instead of
  the yellow curry paste with good results, but here's the recipe for
  the paste if you want to go to the effort:
  
  Place the cumin and coriander seeds in a pan without adding any oil.
  Dry fry them, stirring, over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes until
  they are slightly browned, and give off a roasted aroma.
  
  Coarsely chop the chilies and soak in water for 10 minutes. Drain.
  Pound all the ingredients together to produce a fine paste which goes
  well with beef and pork.
  
  From the same book.  You can work out your frustrations pounding the
  spice mix in a mortar and pestle or you can use a food processor if
  you're feeling particularly harmonious...  Make a lot of the paste
  and save it for use in other curries.

      Title: FRIED CORNMEAL HUSHPUPPY
 Categories: Wildgame, Side dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Cornmeal
      1 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  *Option 1 or 2 egg(s) *Option subst buttermilk for milk *Option
  chopped shallots *Option subst beer for milk Add ingredients to make
  a batter. Heat deep frying oil to 400 degrees. Dip or roll batter
  into quail-egg sized balls and drop into hot oil. Cooking time is
  short, usually just 4 or 5 minutes. Too cool oil will cause slow
  cooking and greasy, soggy hushpuppies. Too hot oil will result in
  crisp brown coat with soft uncooked center. Suggestions: Some people
  add crumbled-up crisp bacon bits. Recipe date: 11/29/87

  1 1/4 c  Stone ground yellow cornmeal
      1 c  Cold water
      3 c  Hot water
      1 ts Salt

  in a large saucepan over high heat and gradually whisk in the
  cornmeal mixture. Stir and whisk until it boils. Cover, lower heat,
  and simmer for 5 minutes. The mixture will be very thick.  Pour into
  an oiled 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan and refrigerate overnight.

  teaspoons of oil or bacon fat.  Dredge 3 or 4 slices in the flour and
  fry them over low heat until golden brown on both sides. Continue to
  cook remaining mush, adding oil to the skillet as needed. Serve with
  either maple syrup or Tomato Gravy and plan on 3 to 4 slices per

    1/2 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 c  Dried bread crumbs (very fin

    1/2 c  Milk
      1    Egg
           Vegetable oil for frying
           Powdered sugar is optional
 
   Combine seasoning mix ingerdients is a small bowl, mixing thoroughly.
  Sprinkle the vegetables evenly with about 1/2 tsp of the mix. Place
  the flour in a small bowl and the breadcrumbs in another. Add 1 tsp
  of the seasoning mix to the flour and one tsp to the breadcrumbs,
  mixing each well. (Use any leftover mix to season other vegetables
  before cooking. In a seperate small bowl combine the milk and egg
  until well blended. Heat 1 inch oil in a 2 qt. saucepan or deep fryer
  to 350 degrees. Just before frying, dredge the chopped vegetables in
  the seasoned flour, shaking off excess. Work quickly so flour doesn't
  get too moist; it's best to use your hands for this, but a slotted
  spoon will do. Then coat well with the milk mixture, then quickly
  with the breadcrumbs, shaking off excess. Place the vegetables in hot
  oil until dark golden brown, about 2-3 minutes, making sure to
  seperate the vegetable pieces as you drop them into the oil. Adjust
  heat as necessary to keep at 350 degrees. Drain and serve
  immediately. Sprinle lightly with powdered sugar (If desired) Source:

 Categories: Sandwiches, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Eggplant
           Salt
      6 oz Mozzarella cheese
           (not grated)
    1/2 ts Yeast
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
           (105-115 degrees)
      2 c  Plain flour
           Pepper to taste
  4 1/2 tb Oil
      1 lg Egg white
           Oil for frying
 
  Slice the eggplant into 1/4" rounds.  Sprinkle with salt and let
  drain in a colandar for about an hour. Slice the mozzarella into thin
  slices and trim to the shape of the eggplant slices. Sprinkle the
  yeast over the warm water abd stir until is dissolved. Whisk in 1 1/2
  cups flour and the pepper until smooth. Keep at room temp for 30 min.
  Rinse and pat dry the eggplant slices.  Fry them in batches using 1 T
  oil per batch over medium heat about 2 min per side. Remove to paper
  towels to drain while you finish the other slices. Place a cheese
  slice between each two eggplant slices (like a sandwich). Press
  firmly together and dip in the remaining flour to coat both sides.
  Beat the egg white until stiff (but not dry) peaks form. Fold into
  the yeast mixture. Heat oil (about 1 inch deep) in a large frying
  pan. Dip 1 eggplant sandwich into the batter at a time and place in
  the hot oil. Fry 4-6 at a time for 1-2 minutes per side until light
  brown. Place on paper towels to drain oil until all are done. Serve
  hot. These are great with a horseradish type dressing on top!
  Depending on the size of the eggplant, this could make 6-12
  sandwiches. Walt MM

      Title: FRIED EMPANADAS WITH BEEF OR CHICKEN FILLING
 Categories: Poultry, Meats
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 kg Plain flour
    250 g  Butter, lard or margarine
      1    Egg
    400 ml Salted water
           Beef filling:
    150 g  Butter, lard or margarine
      2 tb Oil
    750 g  Minced beef
      8    Or 10 green (spring) onions
      1 tb Paprika
           Salt and pepper
      4    Hard boiled eggs, chopped
    250 g  Green olives
      1 ts Ground chilli
    1/4 c  Tomato puree
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Mixed spices
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Beef stock
           Chicken filling:
    500 g  Minced chicken
      3 tb To 4 tb oil
    200 g  Red capsicum, finely chopped
    300 g  Onions, finely chopped
      4 tb Tomato puree
      3    Hard-boiled eggs, chopped
 
  Dough: Oil or a mixture of oil and solid vegetable shortening for deep
  frying.
  
  To make dough: Sift the flour, add the melted shortening and the egg.
  Add the salted water bit by bit and mix to a firm dough. Knead for 10
  minutes if making by hand, 4-5 minutes if using an electric mixer
  with a dough hook, or 1-2 minutes if using a food processor with a
  dough hook. Leave it to rest for 15 to 30 minutes.
  
  To make the beef filling: Heat the oil and shortening in a frying pan
  and saute the green onions, finely chopped. Add the meat and stir
  until it is cooked. Stir in the tomato puree and remaining
  ingredients, cook for a few minutes more. Leave until completely cold
  before assem- bling empanadas.
  
  To make the chicken filling: Heat the oil and fry the onions, then
  add the capsicum and dry until soft. Add the minced chicken and stir
  until it has all changed colour. Season to taste, add the tomato
  puree, mix well and simmer for a further 3 minutes. Leave until
  completely cold before assembling empanadas.
  
  Assembly and cooking: Roll out the dough about 3 mm thick and, using a
  saucer or something similar as a guide, cut into 24-30 circles about
  14 cms in diameter. Divide whichever filling mixture you are using
  between the circles, putting it on one side of the circle only.
  Moisten the outer rim of the dough with water and fold over into a
  semi-circle. Curve the ends of the folded side together a little to
  form a crescent, then secure the joined edges by fold- ing them over
  each other in small sections to form a "rope" effect (if this sounds
  too confusing, just press together and decorate with a fork in the
  usual way). Heat about 6-8 cm deep frying oil to very hot and deep
  fry the empanadas one or two at a time just until golden. Remove from
  the oil immediately and drain well on kitchen paper. Serve very hot
  
  Halve the filling ingredients or double the dough if making both beef
  and chicken empanadas. Empanadas often include raisins or sultanas
  which create an interesting flavour contrast with the meat. A handful
  can be added to either of these recipes if you like.

      Title: FRIED FISH WITH BEER BATTER
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb White fish fillets
           Oil for deep frying
      1    Egg
      1 c  Lager beer
      2 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/4 c  Flour
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  Put oil in dutch oven or other deep pot to a depth of at least 3".
  Set over medium-high flame. Cut fillets into pieces about 2"x4". In a
  bowl, mix egg, beer and 2 TBL oil together. Stir in flour and spices.
  Mix until batter is smooth; it should be a little runny. When oil is
  hot (350-360F degrees), dip fish into batter with tongs or fingers,
  allowing excess batter to drip back into the bowl. Gently place fish
  in the oil and cook until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.
   Do not crowd fish; cook in batches. Drain on paper towels and serve
  immediately. HINTS Use dark beer for stronger flavor. Don't skimp on
  oil, and use a large pot, not a skillet. Use a skimmer between
  batches to remove burned bits of batter. Pat fish dry before dipping
  into the batter.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Fresh Anchovies or Whitebait
      1 c  All-purpose Flour
      5 tb Cold Water
      1 pn Salt
           Oil for Frying

MMMMM------------------------GARLIC SAUCE-----------------------------
      4 sl Bread, crusts trimmed
           (soaked in water for 10 min)
      4 cl Garlic,
           (peeled and roughly chopped)
      2 tb Lemon Juice
  4 1/2 tb Olive Oil
  1 1/2 tb Water (optional)
           Salt and Pepper
      2 ts Fresh Parsley, chopped
           Lemon Wedges for garnish
 
  1) Sift the flour into a deep bowl with the salt. Gradually stir in
  the
     water in the amount needed to make a very thick batter.
  
  2) Heat enough oil for frying in a large, deep pan. A deep-sided
  saute pan
     is ideal.
  
  3) Take 3 fish at a time and dip them into the batter together. Press
     their tails together firmly to make a fan shape.
  
  4) Lower them carefully into the oil. Fry in several batches until
  crisp
     and golden. Continue in the same way with all the remaining fish.
  
  5) Meanwhile, squeeze out the bread and put in a food processor with
  the
     garlic and lemon juice. With the processor running, add the oil in
  a
     thin steady stream. Add water if the mixture is too thick and dry.
  Add
     salt and pepper and stir in parsley by hand. When all the fish are
     cooked, sprinkle lightly with salt and arrange on serving plates
  with
     some of the garlic sauce and lemon wedges.

  garlic, sugar, salt, and 1 tablespoon Nuoc mam sauce in a blender or
  food processor until a very fine paste results.  Rub the paste over
  the frogs' legs, cover and refrigerate again for 30 minutes. 3. Soak
  the vermicelli in warm wate for 30 minutes. Drain and cut into 2 inch
  lengths. 4. Heat the oil in a wok over moderate heat. Add the onion
  and saute until soft, then add the frogs' legs and brown well,
  turning them over from time to time. This should take 3 minutes.  Add
  the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and
  simmer for 15 minutes. 5. Uncover the wok and add the coconut cream.
  Add the cornstarch and the remainng Nuoc Mam sauce. Stir as the sauce
  thickens and cook for another 15 minutes. 6. Add the vermicelli and
  bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat. Sprinkle with black pepper
  and garnish with cilantro sprigs. 7. Serve immediately with rice or
  French bread or rice noodles. It is advisable to offfer an
  alternative to frogs; legs since there are a few cynics who do not
  believe that frogs' legs taste very much like chicken.

      Title: FRIED GREEN TOMATOES & PASTA
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Green tomatoes (about 1
           -md per serving
           Bread crumbs
           REAL parmesan or romano
           Cheese -- grated. (The
           Adventu
           Real yummy very-virgin olive
           Oil
           Garlic cloves
           Angel hair pasta (please,
           Please make your
           Cream, eggs, milk -- or
           Whatever your die
 
  1.  Slice the tomatoes about  1/2 cm thick. (Vary this according to
  your success at frying the suckers!) Dip in cream, then in a mixture
  of bread crumbs and cheese -- about 50% each.
  
  2.  Heat about 50-65 ml olive oil in a large skillet or omelet pan
  until hot, but not smoking. NOTE TO THE NOVICE: Olive oil smokes
  easily! Saute' garlic until LIGHTLY browned. Ifyou overdo the garlic,
  or cook at too high a temperature, it will taste YUCKY! Remove the
  (oh, yeah....peeled and pureed) garlic from the oil and discard. Fry
  the tomato slices until crusty and lightly browned on each side. The
  tomatoes should be softened, but not mushy. You will probably find it
  necessary to make more batches of garlic oil from time to time, as
  you fry up the slices of green tomato. This is good.
  
  3.  You will finally toss all the (cooked) pasta with the remaining
  garlic-ky oil (there should be plenty of this!). If there is some
  cream left over, a LITTLE of this should go in too. Top with the
  fried tomato slices and a generous helping of shredded cheese and a
  little bit of bread crumbs.
  
  Author's Notes: This recipe was made for me and my family by my uncle,
  Larry Ross, former advertising directory of Food & Wine and author of
  Nanny's Texas Table cookbook. The point is, this man is brilliant,
  and I'm proud to claim him as an uncle. Foodwise, that is. I could
  eat at his place for years. It's a little loose, and I've had more
  and less success with it at varying times, but this is the general
  idea. Most recently, I made it for my long-time girlfriend with a
  salmon mousse made with cream cheese topped with capers and lemon,
  and we ended up eating bites of the mousse with the green
  tomato/pasta. (Actually, we ended up doing something quite different,
  but culiNARily speaking....)
  
  I also like to add some grated black pepper -- you should really
  invest in some very, very fresh peppercorns from a good source, if
  possible. The difference is major -- trust me! Also, I mix in a few
  drops of Tabasco for flavor ONLY when tossing with the garlic oil --
  be sparing, and toss WELL. I am SOLELY responsible for any
  aphrodisiac effects this recipe may incite! Please send checks or
  money orders only! Be careful!

      Title: FRIED LEEKS WITH TARRAGON
 Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Leeks, about 1-in thick,
           -white parts only
      1    Egg
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Finely chopped parsley
      1 ts Tarragon
           Flour; for dredging
           Oil for frying
           -canola, lt. olive or peanut
           Tarragon vinegar
 
  TRIM THE LEEKS: Cut off the roots but leave enough so that the leaves
  remain joined at the base. Slice them in half lengthwise down to the
  base but not through it, and rinse them well. Steam them over boiling
  water until they are tender when pierced with a knife, about 10
  minutes, then set on a towel to cool and drain dry. Beat the egg on a
  plate and season with salt and pepper. Add the parsley and half the
  tarragon. Dip the leeks into the egg and slosh them around so that
  they are well covered, then dip them in flour to coat. Heat enough
  oil in a heavy pan to cover the bottom generously. When it is hot
  enough to sizzle a drop of water, add the leeks. Fry them, turning
  them frequently until they're nicely browned all over. Set them on a
  towel to drain briefly. Serve with the remaining tarragon sprinkled
  over the top and a cruet of vinegar on the side.

      Title: FRIED MELT
 Categories: Pork, Reinactment, Main dish, Innards
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Fresh pork melt (spleen)
           Flour
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper to taste
           Brown lard
 
  Cut melts into 1 1/2-inch cubes after thoroughly rinsing.  Roll in
  flour to coat well.  Melt lard in a cast iron skillet until it begins
  to smoke. Dump in the meat. Stir constantly but gently until the
  flour is browned in the hot lard.  Add salt and pepper.  Continue
  cooking for a few minutes until melt is cooked (much like liver).
  Serve hot.
  
  NOTE:  The spleen is much like the liver in taste, but a bit more
  delicate. It also has a much lighter and finer texture without
  gristle or strings. If you like liver, you will love melts.  It is
  also great for campfire cooking.

      1    Vanilla bean
  5 1/2 tb Granulated sugar
      1    Egg
  4 1/2 tb All-purpose flour
  4 1/2 tb Cornstarch
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      3    Eggs, beaten
           2-3 TBSP vegetable oil for
           Frying
           Ground cinnamon and powdered
           Sugar for dusting
 
  In a large pot with heavy bottom, heat the milk with the vanilla bean
  just until it starts to boil. Remove from the heat and set aside. In
  a medium bowl, beat the sugar and 1 egg with a wooden spoon until
  well blended. Add the 4 1/2 TBSP flour and the cornstarch; mix well.
  Remove the vanilla bean from the milk and bring to a boil. Remove
  from the heat and slowly add the milk to the flour mixture, stirring
  all the while. Pour the mixture back into the pot and bring to a boil
  again; stir constantly as you let it boil until it begins to thicken
  a bit (about 6 to 8 minutes). WATCH CAREFULLY SO IT DOES NOT BURN.
  Pour into a small greased baking dish or metal try. The mixture
  should be about 3/4 inch deep. Cool in the refrigerator. Cut into
  3-inch squares. Put 1 cup flour in a shallow bowl and the 3 eggs in
  another. Pass the squares through the beaten eggs; gently fry on both
  sides in vegetable oil until golden. Place in the middle of a metal
  dish, sprinkle with cinnamon and powdered sugar and serve warm. (This

      Title: FRIED MOZZARELLA CHEESE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Mozzarella cheese
    1/2 c  Flour
      3 lg Eggs
      1 c  Bread crumbs
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Cumin, ground
      1 pn Salt and pepper
      8 oz Marinara sauce,
           -chilled
           Vegetable oil
 
  Cut the mozzarella into sticks a bit more than about 1/4 inch thick
  and about 1 1/2 inches long. Coat the sticks with flour, shaking off
  excess. Combine the bread crumbs and seasonings in a flat dish. Beat
  the eggs and place in a separate bowl.
  
  Coat the sticks by dipping them in the egg and then in the bread
  crumbs. The coating on the first stick should be fairly dry when you
  finish the last stick. Repeat with another dip in the egg and then in
  the bread crumbs.
  
  Deep-fry the coated sticks in oil for about 3 to 4 minutes until the
  coating is cooked. Fry in batches, keeping the finished ones warm in
  the oven. Serve with chilled marinara sauce or salsa.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fried mozzarella sticks with marinara -- Use your imagination when
  choosing spices. The spices listed here are just a suggestion.
  
  *  Be careful when frying, as some sticks split open when they are
  done, leaving lots of cheese in your frying oil. You may need more
  egg or bread crumbs, depending on how many sticks you have and how
  thick you coat them.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (frying skill required).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: FRIED MULTIGRAIN RICE
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Rice
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 c  Uncle Ben's Multigrain
           -(approx. measure, enough
           -for 2)
      1 ts Olive oil
      6    Mushrooms, sliced
    1/4    Yellow bell pepper, diced
           -small
    1/4    Red bell pepper, diced
           -small
    1/2 c  Carrots, sliced thin and/or
           -spinach, chopped
      1    Clove Garlic, mashed to
           -pulp
      1 tb Instant India
 
  Rice: Ignore package directions. Cook in rice cooker same as white
  rice. One time I reduced water to cut cooking time close to
  directions; it came out tough.
  
  Other: While rice is cooking, saute mushrooms, peppers and carrots for
  15-20 minutes. Add garlic and spinach toward the end. If necessary,
  deglaze pan with beverage of choice (Seagram's Margarita cooler works
  <g>). Add Instant India then cooked rice. Stir-fry for a minute or
  two.
  
  Variations: Peppers aren't essential. I happened to have them & they
  add color interest. Most people would use half an onion, and maybe
  some green onion tops for color. Bean sprouts, tofu and green peas
  would be good additions. Soy sauce is traditional. Too salty and
  unnecessary -- this rice is plenty brown enough. Instant India was a
  stroke of genius. 'Indianized' fried rice is better than oriental.
  The trick is don't use so much that it tastes like Curried Rice.
  Lacking Instant India you could fake it with curry powder and finely
  diced onions.

  Cut the potatoes into 3/4"x3/4"x1/8" pieces. Coarsly dice the onion.
  Crush the garlic and chop the dill fine. Split the oil between two
  seperate frying pans. Slowly fry the potatoes in one and starting it
  slightly later, saute the onions in the other. The potatoes should be
  just crisp on the outside, moist and flufy on the inside and the
  onions should be clear with the edges just starting to turn brown.
  When both are done, add the garlic to the onions, and cook for only
  30 seconds or a minute, no more. Add the onions and garlic with the
  fresh dill to the potatoes. Carefully combine them so the onions and
  dill are evenly distributed and the dill just 'wilts'. Serve
  immediately.

      Cut off and discard the top half-inch of the onions. Peel them
  but do not cut off the root end. Place each onion, root end up, on a
  cutting board. With a sharp, pointed knife, make vertical cuts all
  around the onion about a quarter inch apart.
  
      Start the cut a quarter-inch from the root for small onions or a
  half-inch from the root for very large ones. Make sure the knife goes
  into the center of the onion.
  
      Place all the onions in a large bowl of cold water, add ice cubes,
  cover and refrigerate several hours or overnight. The onions will
  open up like mums. Drain upside-down when ready to proceed. In a
  large bowl, mix together thoroughly the flour, baking powder and
  spices. In another bowl, beat together the eggs and milk.
  
      Dip the onions one by one into the egg mixture, opening the
  petals with your fingers; let the excess drip off, and place in flour.
   Work the flour mixture into the center gently with fingertips. Shake
  off excess flour and repeat egg dip and flouring, shaking off the
  excess thoroughly.
  
      Half-fill a deep fryer or large, deep, heavy pot with oil. (The
  author of this recipe used the bottom of her pressure cooker -- a
  small electric fryer will NOT do.)
  
      Heat the oil to 360F or until a small piece of dry bread turns
  deep gold in 15 seconds.  Fry the onions without crowding them -- one
  at a time for large ones ~- keeping them submerged with a spatula or
  by placing the frying basket on top of them.  Plunge them in root end
  up and turn them over once.
  
      To serve at once, fry large onions for about six or seven minutes,
  small ones for five minutes, or until deep gold. Drain upside-down on
  paper towels; then invert on a serving plate. Keep warm in a low oven
  while frying the others.  Remove the centers of large onions with a
  very sharp knife.  Small onions may be left whole or the center can
  be scooped out with a melon-ball cutter.  If serving the next day,
  fry the onions until pale gold; do not fry completely. Let cool. When
  ready to serve, reheat the oil to 380F and fry the onions just long
  enough to heat and brown, about 15 seconds.  Drain and serve. To get
  the same taste without making mums, simply cut onions ver- tically to
  make "petals" or crosswise and separate into rings. This can be done
  ahead and the petals or rings kept in ice water. Egg, flour and fry
  as above.

      Title: FRIED PORK CHOPS
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8    Pork chops; 3/4 inch thick
           -  about 4 pounds  -
           Salt
           Black pepper; freshly ground
      2 c  All-purpose flour
           Vegetable oil
           Paprika
 
  Recipe by: Sylvia Woods Preparation Time: 1:00 1) Trim the excess fat
  from the edges of the pork chops. Sprinkle them generously with salt
  and pepper.
  
  2)  Season the flour generously with salt and pepper. Dredge the pork
  chop in flour until coated on all sides. Shake off any excess flour.
  Pour enough vegetable oil into a heavy deep skillet (cast-iron is
  perfect) to fill it to 1 inch.  Heat over medium heat to 375oF. (A
  small cube of bread dropped in the oil will brown in about 30
  seconds.)
  
  3)  Add only as many of the pork chops to the skillet as will fit
  without touching.  Cook  them, turning them once, until cooked
  through (no trace of pink remaining in the center) and deep golden
  brown, about 12 minutes. Use a long-handled fork or tongs to prevent
  getting splattered.
  
  4)  Remove the pork chops from the skillet to drain. Sprinkle them
  with paprika and serve hot.

      8 oz Cooked Pork - boned, cut
           -into 1-inch squares
    1/2 bn Scallions - cleaned, cut in
           -half
    1/4 ts Ginger - ground
      1    Egg Yolk
      2 tb Soy Sauce
      1 tb Sesame Oil
      2 ts Dry Sherry
    1/2 ts Lemon Pepper
  1 1/2 c  Flour - all purpose
      6 tb Water
      1 ds MSG
           HOT GARLIC SAUCE:
      4    Clove Garlic
    1/2 ts Szechwan Hot Oil
      1 ts Vinegar
      1 ts Sherry
      3 tb Soy Sauce
 
  Using knife blade, coarsely chop pork and scallions in food processor,
  using short bursts. Add ginger, egg yolk, soy sauce, sesame oil, dry
  sherry and lemon pepper. Process a few short bursts to mix. Set this
  pork mixture on plate. Rinse and dry processor bowl and blade.
  
  Place flour and MSG in processor bowl. Using knife blade, process
  continuously while adding water all at once. Let processor run until
  a ball of dough forms in the bowl, or 20 seconds, whichever comes
  first. Remove dough and knead until elastic. Using half of dough,
  roll out on lightly floured board to 1/16-inch thick. Cut into 2-inch
  circles using biscuit cutter.
  
  Place a rounded teaspoon of pork mixture in center of each dough
  circle. Fold circle over filling, creating a "half moon" turnover.
  Press edges together lightly with fingers. Place filled dumplings on
  oiled plate.
  
  In 3-quart saucepan bring 2 quarts of water to boil. Drop dumplings in
  boiling water. Allow to boil one minute AFTER the dumpling returns to
  surface of water. Drain well; replace dump- lings on oiled plate to
  cool slightly. Meanwhile, heat 1/2 cup cooking oil in skillet over
  medium to medium-high heat. Add dumplings; fry, turning often, until
  lightly brown. Drain on paper towels.
  
  Process garlic sauce ingredients using knife blade until smooth.
  Serve hot dumplings with garlic sauce. May also be served with
  Chinese mustard and/or hoisin sauce.

  continuously while adding water all at once. Let processor run until
  a ball of dough forms in the bowl, or 20 seconds, whichever comes
  first. Remove dough and knead until elastic. Using half of dough,
  roll out on lightly floured board to 1/16-inch thick. Cut into 2-inch
  circles using biscuit cutter.

  Press edges together lightly with fingers. Place filled dumplings on
  oiled plate.
    In 3-quart saucepan bring 2 quarts of water to boil. Drop dumplings
  in boiling water. Allow to boil one minute AFTER the dumpling returns
  to surface of water. Drain well; replace dump- lings on oiled plate
  to cool slightly. Meanwhile, heat 1/2 cup cooking oil in skillet over
  medium to medium-high heat. Add dumplings; fry, turning often, until
  lightly brown. Drain on paper towels.
    Process garlic sauce ingredients using knife blade until smooth.
  Serve hot dumplings with garlic sauce. May also be served with
  Chinese mustard and/or hoisin sauce.

           -in diameter.
     24    Raw medium shrimp, peeled
           -with tail section
           -attached, deveined
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes a
  recipe for Fried Shrimp Rolls!!!  These triangular little goodies are
  great when served alongside Cha Gio. These are *really* good! Prepare
  the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.
  
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile. Work with
  only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a
  barely damp cloth to prevent curling.
  
  Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water. Remove and spread
  flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it
  out without touching the other round. The rice papers will become
  pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Place 1 shrimp in
  the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.
  Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press
  into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it
  is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely
  and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold
  the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle. The completed
  roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers
  in the same manner.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will
  stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning
  often until crisp and golden brown. Drain the rolls on paper towels.
  Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and
  coriander leaves.
  
  NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F
  oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.
  
  Yield: 24 shrimp rolls.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        4 lg soft-shell crabs, -- cleaned
  :          and rinsed
      1/2 c  Crystal Hot Sauce
        1 c  Crawfish mashed potatoes
      1/2 c  flour
        1 c  dried fine bread crumbs
  :          Essence
        2    eggs, beaten
        2 TB milk
        1 c  sauteed spinach (saute with
  :          olive oil,
  :          garlic, shallots, salt and
  :          pepper)
        1 c  Tasso Hollandaise Sauce, --
  :          hot, recipe follows
        2 TB chopped chives
  
  Preheat the fryer. Marinate the soft-shells in the hot sauce for 20
  minutes. Remove the soft-shells from the sauce. Stuff each soft-shell
  with about 1/4 cup of the Crawfish Mash Potatoes. **Place the
  stuffing in the soft pocket above the body of the soft-shell. Season
  the flour and bread crumbs with Essence. In a small mixing bowl,
  whisk the eggs and milk together. Season the mixture with Essence.
  Dredge the soft-shells in the flour. Dip the soft-shells in the egg
  wash, letting any excess drip off. Dredge the soft-shells in the
  bread crumbs, coating each side completely. Hold the body of the crab
  with the claw and legs hanging down over the hot oil and carefully
  drop it in. Fry until golden brown, flipping the crabs with tongs 2-3
  times to brown evenly. The crabs will float to the surface of the oil
  when they are cooked. Remove from the fryer and drain on paper-lined
  plate. Season the crabs with Essence. Mound the spinach in the center
  of the plate. Lay the crabs on top of the spinach. Spoon the
  Hollandaise over the crabs and around the plate. Garnish with chives
  and peppers.

 Categories: Philippine, Appetizers
      Yield: 30 Rolls
 
      3 c  Oil
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 lb Lean pork, ground
    1/2 lb Shrimp, shelled, deveined,
           -minced
    3/4 c  Minced water chestnuts
      2    Carrots, minced
      1 c  Minced celery
    1/2 c  Green onions, cut very fine
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Salt (optional)
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
           Spring roll wrappers, 8" in
           -diameter
           Sweet and Sour sauce
 
  In a wok or pan, heat 2 tb oil. Add garlic and stir until fragrant,
  about 5 seconds. Add the pork and shrimp and stir-fry for 1 minute.
  Add the water chestnuts, carrots, celery, and green onions. Stir-fry
  for approximately 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but
  still crunchy. Add the soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Stir. Remove from
  heat. Drain excess moisture from pan.
  
  To assemble the rolls, place about 1/3 c of the filling on the lower
  third of the wrapper. Fold the portion of the wrapper nearest you
  over the filling until just covered. Turn the wrapper again to
  enclose the filling securely. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with
  water or a mixture of cornstarch and water. Fold over the corners and
  press down firmly to seal, making an envelope. Moisten the flap of
  the envelope with water and turn, rolling firmly into a 1-inch
  cylinder. Seal firmly. Set aside, seam side down. Repeat until all
  the filling has been used.
  
  Heat oil in a wok to 375 degrees. Place 4 or 5 rolls at a time in the
  hot oil. Deep-fry until crisp and golden. Remove with a skimmer and
  drain on paper towels. Serve hot with Sweet and Sour sauce.
  
  Rolls may be prepared ahead of time and frozen, then fried when
  needed.

      6    Dried Chinese mushrooms
      1 tb Dried tree ear mushrooms
      6    Water chestnuts or 1/2
           -small jicama, peeled and
           -chopped
      4 oz Fresh or canned lump

      2 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      3    Eggs

MMMMM-------------------ASSEMBLING AND FRYING------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     80 sm Rounds of rice paper (banh
           -trang), each 6 1/2 inches
           -in diameter
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  This is another version of the superlative Cha Gio (also called
  Nems). The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first
  one. Boil the noodles. Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water
  until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain. Remove the stems from the
  mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid. Mince the mushrooms.
  Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a
  large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must
  be handled with care. (The water is used to soften the sheets for
  handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep
  golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with
  only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets
  covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,
  immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat
  on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice
  paper will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Press into a
  compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the
  filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F. Working in batches,
  add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or let them
  touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat for 10 to
  12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp. Remove the rolls
  with tongs and drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a low oven while
  frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in
  this recipe.
  
  To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few
  strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the
  Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham. If served as an
  hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a main
  course.
  
  NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the
  noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the
  individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground
  roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.
  
  As a quick and easy appetizer, Cha Gio can be served with just Nuoc
  Cham.
  
  Yield: about 80 spring rolls.

      2    Thinly Sliced Shallots
      1 tb Chopped Green Thai Chili
           - Peppers
      2 tb Fresh Lime Juice
 
  The South is known for its abundance of seafood and supplies much of
  the seafood of Thailand.  This is one of the many easy but delicious
  recipes for simply prepared fish. Sun-dried mackerel is available
  already prepared, but its flavor may be too strong for Western
  palates. Other fish may be substituted if desired.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Rinse the mackerel steaks and dry them thoroughly
  with paper towels, removing as much moisture as possible.
  
  Heat the oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. Carefully lay the
  mackerel steaks onto the oil and fry for 5 minutes on each side, or
  until the outside of the fish is golden brown and the inside is hot.
  
  Remove the steaks to a serving dish and scatter the shallots and chili
  peppers on top.  Drizzle with lime juice and serve immediately.

      Title: FRIED TOFU
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      7 oz Firm Chinese tofu
           Oil for deep-frying
 
  Deep-fried tofu is used everywhere in Southeast Asia as a hot
  appetizer with a dipping sauce  or as a meat substitute. The first
  step of pressing the tofu may not be necessary if your tofu is firm
  enough; just drain it thoroughly. Most Japanese-style tofu will have
  to be pressed.
  
  1. Drain tofu cakes well. Wrap in a clean kitchen towel or several
  thicknesses of paper towel, place in a plate set on a sheet pan, and
  invert another plate on top. Place a 1-pound weight (canned food, a
  cookbook, etc.) on the top plate. Let stand 30 minutes, unwrap, and
  drain. The tofu will have exuded a lot of liquid. The recipe may be
  prepared ahead of time to this point and refrigerated.
  
  2. Slice pressed tofu into squares, triangles, or other shapes about
  1/8 inch thick. Heat oil to 350 degrees F in a wok or other deep pan.
  Fry tofu pieces a few at a time until puffy and golden brown, 6 to 8
  minutes.
  
  Serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer.

      1 lg Leek, white part only,
           -chopped
      6    Water chestnuts, or
    1/2 sm Jicama, peeled and chopped
      1 lb Firm bean curd (tofu),
           -crumbled
      1 c  Fresh bean sprouts, coarsely
           -chopped
      6    Garlic cloves, minced
      3 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      2    Eggs
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper

MMMMM--------------------ASSEMBLY AND FRYING-------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     40 sm Rounds of rice papers (banh
           -trang), 6 1/2 inches in
           -diameter
           Peanut oil for frying
 
  The book notes that true Buddhist vegetarians would not use garlic or
  fish sauce and would limit the dips to plain soy or plum sauce.
  Unless you are in this category, Peanut Sauce (Nuoc Leo) and Nuoc
  Cham are great dips as well.
  
  Prepare the Vegetable Platter, noodles and dipping sauce. Set aside.
  
  Soak the noodles in warm water and the mushrooms in hot water for 30
  minutes; drain.  Cut the noodles into 1/2-inch lengths. Remove and
  discard the stems from the mushrooms; squeeze to extract most of the
  soaking liquid.  Mince all of the mushrooms.
  
  Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl; blend
  well with your hands.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a large bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.
  
  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with only 4 sheets at a time,
  keeping the remaining sheets covered with a barely damp cloth to
  prevent curling.
  
  Immerse the rice paper, one sheet at a time, into the sweetened warm
  water. Quickly withdraw it and lay it flat on a dry towel. Do this
  with 4 sheets without letting them touch each other. The rice paper
  will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold over the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion. Press it into a
  compact rectangle.  Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side.  Roll from the bottom to the top to completely
  enclose the filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used. (The
  rolls can be prepared 1 day in advance.  Wrap and refrigerate.)
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible use 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 inches
  of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F. Working in batches, add
  some of the rolls without letting them touch, or they will stick
  together. Fry for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and
  crisp. Remove the rolls from the oil with tongs and drain on paper
  towels. Keep warm in a low oven until all of th rolls are cooked.
  
  To serve, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with some
  noodles and selected items from the Vegetable Platter and dips the
  package in the dipping sauce.
  
  NOTE:  The fried rolls can be frozen, then thawed and reheated in a
  350F oven just to crisp and heat through.
  
  Yield: 40 rolls.

      Title: FRIED WHOLE FISH NONYA STYLE (IKAN GORENG TAU
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
  1 1/2 lb Whole Snapper, Rockfish,
           -Porgy, or similar fish
           Salt
      1 md Onion or 1/4 pound shallots,
           -chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
      1    Stalk lemongrass, thinly
           -sliced
    1/2 ts Shrimp paste (optional)
      3    Fresh red or green chiles,
           -seeds and veins removed,
           -chopped, or:
    1/2 ts Chili powder
      2 sl Fresh galangal or 1 teaspoon
           -ground
    1/3 c  (approximately) cornstarch
           Oil, for deep frying
      2 tb Yellow bean sauce, mashed
    1/3 c  Tamarind Water
      1 pn Sugar
           Fresh Basil for garnish
 
  1. Prepare fish as directed below. Pat dry with paper towels, sprinkle
  lightly with salt, and set aside.
  
  2. In a mortar, food processor, or blender, combine onion, garlic,
  lemongrass, shrimp paste (if used), chiles, and galangal and process
  to a paste.
  
  3. Pat fish dry again and dust liberally with cornstarch, rubbing it
  into cuts in sides.
  
  4. Fill a wok or deep skillet with oil to a depth of at least 2 inches
  (allow room for oil to rise when fish is added). Heat oil to 375
  degrees F. Carefully add fish to oil, placing it on its side. Ladle
  oil over any exposed part of fish. Fry fish on both sides, turning
  once with slotted spoons or Chinese wire skimmer, until a skewer
  easily penetrates thickest part. Lift fish out of oil and let drain
  over pan, then transfer to warm serving platter.
  
  5. Turn off heat under frying oil, allow to cool, and reserve for
  frying fish another time. in another skillet or wok, heat 2
  tablespoons oil over medium heat (some of the frying oil can be used
  for this step). Add seasoning paste and cook, stirring, until quite
  fragrant. Add yellow bean sauce, cook another few seconds, and add
  Tamarind Water and sugar. Cook sauce until slightly thickened.
  
  6. Blot away any accumulated oil from fish platter and pour sauce over
  fish. Garnish with sprigs of coriander, if desired.
  
  Serves 4 with other dishes.
  
  Like poultry, fish retains its flavor and moisture better if cooked
  whole with the bones.  To prepare a whole fish for frying or
  steaming, follow these steps.
  
  1. Have fish cleaned and scaled, with head and tail left on. Cut open
  bell cavity, if this was not done in cleaning. Pull away any bits of
  gills and internal organs. Look for two strips of red tissue lying
  alongside backbone; if present, cut them open wit tip of knife. Rinse
  cavity well under running water until no trace of bloody tissue
  remains.
  
  2. Score both sides of fish with diagonal cuts almost to the bone, 1
  to 2 inches apart.  This speeds the cooking time and allows the
  seasonings to penetrate the fish faster. if you want to serve a
  steamed or fried fish @(swimming" on the platter (belly side down),
  cut back from cavity toward tail on one side of bones, extending the
  cavity toward the tail. Spread the rib cage open and arrange the fish
  upright on the steaming plate, bending the tail to fit, if necessary.

      Title: FRIED WON TONS
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Won ton skins
    1/2 lb Fresh ground pork
    1/2 lb Fresh prawns
      4    Dried mushrooms, soaked for
           -2 hours
      8    Water chestnuts, finely
           -chopped
      2    Stalks green onions, finely
           -chopped
      2 sm Eggs, beaten
    1/4 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Here are three won ton related recipes++fried won tons, won ton soup
  and a dip for the fried won tons. I have recipes for won ton dough
  too, if you want them. Personally, I find the won ton skins available
  in markets to be just fine and a lot less work!
  
  Yield: About 60 to 70.
  
  Shell and devein prawns.  Mince fine.  Stem mushrooms and mince caps.
  Mix with prawns, pork, water chestnuts, green onions, half of the
  beaten eggs and all of the seasonings.
  
  WRAPPING:
  
  Place won ton squares on working surface so corners face up, down,
  left and right.  Place 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each skin.
  
  Dip a little of the beaten egg onto the bottom corner, bring top
  corner to meet bottom corner.  Press to seal. Moisten left corner and
  bring right corner to meet it. Press to seal. [This should give you a
  little bundle that looks kinda like a nurses hat. S.C.]
  
  FRYING:
  
  Heat 4 cups oil in wok.  Fry wrapped won ton until golden (about 2
  minutes).  Turn over once.  Drain and serve hot.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES:
  
  Deep fry won ton, cool and freeze.  To reheat, preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Place frozen won ton onto cookie sheets and heat for 12 to 15 minutes.
  
  COMMENTS:
  
  You may substitute ground turkey for meat in won ton filling.
  
  However since turkey is drier and more bland than pork, add a few more
  water chestnuts and 1/4 tsp. monosodium glutamate to enhance flavor
  and texture.

           Very coarsely chopped
      1 md Red onion,
           Sliced very thin
      1 c  Grated Parmesan
           Or
           Romano cheese, grated
           Vegetable oil for frying
      1 c  Flour
      1    Egg
    3/4 c  Milk (or more if needed)
      2 ts Garlic salt
           Dash of black pepper
 
  Mix together the flour, egg, milk and seasonings and whisk together.
  The batter should be the consistency of a medium thick pancake
  batter. Pour enough oil into a heavy fry pan to a depth of about 1/2"
  and heat to high. Dip the slices of zucchini in the batter to fully
  cover each slice and drop gently into the hot oil. Fry on each side
  to a golden brown, drain for a few minutes on a paper towel and set
  in a baking dish in layers. In between each layer sprinkle some
  Parmesan cheese, spread a few rings of the onion slices and sprinkle
  a little of the basil leaves. Cover with foil as you fry the
  remaining zucchini to keep warm and lightly steam. Serve immediately.

    3/8 c  Cooking Oil
      4    Eggs
      1 c  Chopped Nuts
      1    Portion Fruit
 
  In the one gallon jar, combine the pineapple, 1 cup sugar and 2
  tablespoons of brandy. Let ingredients sit in jar for 2 weeks,
  stirring daily. At the end of two weeks, add the maraschino cherries,
  1 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of brandy. Let the mixture sit for
  two more weeks, stirring daily. During the forth week add the canned
  peaches, 1 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons of brandy. Let sit another two
  weeks, stirring daily. Seperate the liquid from the fruit. The liquid
  is your starter and you can use the fruit on ice cream or cake. Now
  you are ready to prepare the fruit for two cakes.
  
  DO NOT refrigerate the liquid. In a large gallon jar, put 1 1/2 cups
  of the starter, 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 large can (28 Oz.) sliced
  peaches. Mix well and cover jar with a paper towel. Do not
  refrigerate or screw lid on jar. Stir every day for 10 days. Next,
  add 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 can (16 oz.) crushed pineapple. Stir
  everyday for 10 days. Add 2 1/2 cups sugar and 1 can (16 oz.) fruit
  cocktail. Slice contents of 1 jar (10 oz.) maraschino cherries and
  add with juice. Stir every day for 10 days.
  
  On baking day, drain the fruit and divide it into two equal parts.
  Save the juice and use it as starter for friends. You will have
  enough for five starters (approximately 2 cups each). DO NOT
  refrigerate the liquid because it will stop the fermenting action.
  For each cake you will need: To each cake mix, add pudding mix, oil,
  and eggs. Beat until smooth and fold in fruit and nuts, batter will
  be thick. Pour mixture into a greased tube pan, then bake at 350
  degrees for 50 to 60 minutes. Turn cake out of pan while hot. When
  cooled, the cake freezes well. The choices of flavored cake mixes and
  pudding mixes is yours and coconut may be substituted for nuts.

  peaches with the juice; cut each slice into 4 pieces. Add 2 1/2 cups
  sugar. Stir. Cover jar loosely and keep at room temperature. Stir
  every day for 10 days. All the sugar may not dissolve for several
  days. Don't cover airtight. Day 10. Add can of pineapple tidbits with
  juice and 2 1/2 cups sugar. Stir. Continue as before, stirring every
  day for 10 more days. Your starter has changed color and your fruit
  will foam when stirred. Day 20. Add 3 6-oz jars of maraschino
  cherries, drained. Cut each cherry in half. Add 2 1/2 cups sugar.
  Stir.  Continue stirring daily for 10 days. These are the last ten

  31. You will now bake your cakes.  Preheat oven to 300~. Grease and
  flour your pans.  Drain fruit into a large bowl. Pour juice into 3
  pint jars. Into a large bowl put 1 box cake mix, 1 box instant
  vanilla pudding mix, 4 eggs, 2/3 cup oil and 1/2 the drained fruit.
  Mix with a spoon only until well mixed. Then stir in 1 cup each of
  raisins, walnuts, pecans and coconut. Pour into prepared pans. Bake
  until straw inserted in center comes out clean. Makes 2 tube pans or
  12 one pound loaves or 4 loaves, 9 1/2x5 1/2x3-inch. Bake one tube
  pan at a time for approximately 60-90 minutes. Bake large loaves for
  60-90 minutes or until a straw inserted in center comes out clean.

      Title: FRIJOLES (SOUTH AMERICAN BEANS)
 Categories: Columbian, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Got another care package from Down Under, courtesy Mark Herron. The
  following series of recipes are from the Raw Materials column by Meryl
  Constance who writes for the Sydney Morning Herald. The three columns
  this time covered basil, veal and strawberries (remember them? ;-}).
  Pay attention now++there's some good-looking stuff here...
  
  This recipe comes from Antioquia in Colombia but variations on the
  theme are made all over South and Central America. In Colombia, it is
  served with rice and a number of side dishes, including crisp pork
  crackling, bananas, avocados and white corncakes. Stretched in this
  way, the quantities given here would easily serve eight.
  
  Into a large pot 2 cups of red kidney beans (not pre-soaked). Add 5
  cups of a mixture made from the liquid drained from a large tin of
  peeled tomatoes (the tomatoes themselves are used later) and your
  choice of stock.
  
  Do not add salt it is said to prevent the beans softening properly.
  Cover the pot and put the beans to cook over a low heat. South
  American practice is to add a tablespoon of oil when the beans begin
  to wrinkle but Raw Materials omits this with no ill-effects. Continue
  cooking until tender++about 2 to
        3    hours.
  
  Meanwhile, finely chop 2 large onions and 4 cloves of garlic and fry
  gently in a little oil.  Add 500 g minced meat (usually beef but take
  your choice) and fry very slowly until brown. Add the tinned
  tomatoes, a chopped green capsicum, 2 or 3 bay leaves, 2 teaspoons
  cumin, half a bunch of basil (chopped), 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper,
  pepper and salt.
  
  Tip the contents of the frying pan into the beans and simmer slowly
  till well blended.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: FRIJOLES BORRACHOS
 Categories: Beans, Tex-mex, Alcohol
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Pinto beans
      6 c  ;water or more as needed
     12 oz Beer
      2 ts Bacon drippings or
           Peanut oil
      1 lg Onion; chopped
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      2    Fresh jalapenos or
      1    To 2 serranos; chopped
      2    Pickled jalapenos; chopped
      1 ts Chili powder
      1 ts Salt; optional
 
  Pick through the beans and rinse them, watching for any gravel or
  grit. Soak the beans in water, enough to cover them by several
  inches, preferably overnight.
  
  Drain the beans, and add them to a stockpot or a large, heavy
  saucepan. Cover them with the water and beer. Simmer the beans,
  uncovered, over low heat.
  
  After 1 hour, stir the beans up from the bottom and check the liquid
  level. If there is not at least an inch more water than beans, add
  enough hot water to bring it to that level. Simmer the beans another
  30 minutes, then check them again, adding water as needed.
  
  When the beans are well softened, add the remaining ingredients, and
  continue simmering.  Cook at least 15 more minutes, keeping the level
  of the water just above the beans. The beans are done when they are
  soft and creamy but not mushy, with each bean retaining its shape.
  There should be extra liquid at the completion of the cooking time,
  although the beans should not be soupy.  If you want the liquid a
  little thicker, squash a few of the beans in the bottom of the pot
  with a potato or bean masher.
  
  Serve the beans immediately, or cover them and keep them warm for as
  long as 1 hour.  Or let them cool, and refrigerate or freeze them for
  later use.

  way up the pot. Bring water to a boil and add 1 large quartered onion
  and 3-4 slices of bacon. During the cooking process, the onion will
  become mush. This and the bacon add real flavor to the beans.
  
  Cook over low heat for 3-4 hours until the beans are very soft and
  tender. Beans should just bubble, not boil, during the cooking
  process. During the first 90 minutes, stir and check frequently. The
  beans absorb a large amount of water and you will have to add some
  periodically to prevent burning.
  
  Add salt during the last 30 minutes.  Finished beans should have the
  consistency of bean soup, which I guess this is.
  
  PREPARE FRIJOLES REFRITOS:  Heat oil in a medium skillet. Add drained
  cooked pinto beans to the skillet and mash up into a paste. (I use an
  old hand potato masher but a perforated metal cooking spoon also
  works well).
  
  Saute the beans over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring
  frequently to prevent burning and adding a little bean broth as
  necessary for proper consistency. The finished beans should be like
  thick library paste in texture.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tex-Mex style pinto beans are known in Mexico as "Frijoles En
  Olla," or beans in the pot.  This is the basis for refried beans
  (Frijoles Refrito), but we also like it as well as a side dish.
  Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes, plus cooking time of frijoles en olla.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      1 lb (500 grams) dried,
           -black-eyed beans (see
           -cook's notes)
           Salt to taste
      4 fl Ounces (125 milliters)
           -vegetable oil
      4 lg Onions, diced
     10 ea Ounces (315 grams)
           -tomatoes, blanched, peeled
           -and diced (see cook's

  Optional: 2 to 3 red chiles (hot peppers), diced (optional) 1/2 pound
  (250 grams) smoked or fried fish, boned, skinned and cut in small
  chunks 4 ounces (125 grams) dried prawns (shrimp); see cook's notes
  Cook's notes: Black-eyed beans may take up to 1 hour to cook. One can
  (14 ounces) diced tomatoes with their liquid can be substituted for
  the fresh tomatoes. Dried shrimp are available in Asian markets;
  small peeled fresh shrimp can be substituted ++ just add them during
  the last 5 minutes of cooking. To prevent scorching, we added 1/2 cup
  water when adding the cooked beans to the onion mixture. Chopped
  fresh cilantro sprinkled over the finished dish is suggested.
  Preliminaries: Soak the black-eyed beans overnight in plenty of
  water. Procedure: Rinse the beans with fresh water several times then
  boil them in a large saucepan, with plenty of salted water. Cook
  30-40 minutes or until the beans are soft but not mushy. Drain and
  set them aside. In a separate large cooking pot, heat the oil. Fry
  the onions until golden, add the tomatoes, turmeric and chiles (hot
  peppers) and stir well to prevent burning. Cook about 3 minutes on
  medium heat, stirring all the time. Add the fish and prawns (shrimp)
  and stir. Lower the heat and cook 3 more minutes. Stir in the cooked
  beans and simmer 10-15 minutes. Presentation: Serve with grilled or
  fried plantains and boiled "arroz blanco" (white rice). Yield: Makes

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Beans, cooked (3-1/2 to 4
           -cups with broth)
           A 10 inch frying pan
      6 tb Melted lard or pork

    1/4    Onion, finely chopped
      2 oz Queso fresco, crumbled (I

           -Jack)
     12    Totopos (fried tortillas, or
           -tortilla chips)
           Some romaine lettuce leaves
      6    Radish roses
 
  Heat the lard and fry the onion, without browning, until it is soft.
  
  Add 1 cup of the beans and their broth to the pan and mash them well
  over a very high flame. (With a bean masher or wooden potato masher)
  Add the rest of the beans gradually, mashing them all the time, until
  you have a course puree.
  
  When the puree begins to dry out and sizzle at the edges, it will
  start to come away from the surface of the pan. As you let it
  continue cooking, tip the pan from side to side. The puree will form
  itself into a loose roll. This will take from 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Tip the roll, rather like folding an omelet, onto the serving dish and
  garnish with the cheese.  Spike it with the crisp triangles of
  tortillas. Decorate.

 Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads
      Yield: 20 Friselle
 
  1 1/4 ts Dried yeast
  1 3/4 c  Warm water
    2/3 c  Biga Pugliese or durum flour
           -- biga
  3 3/4 c  Durum or wholewheat flour
  2 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Stir the yeast into 1/2 c warm water & let proof for 10 minutes. Stir
  in the rest of the water & the biga. Mix until the starter is broken
  up & well mixed.  Add the salt & the flour, 1 c at a time, mixing
  until the dough comes together.  Add more water if necessary to
  prevent the dough coming away from the bottom of the bowl. Knead on a
  very lightly floured board until the dough comes together. Set in an
  oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap & let rise until doubled, about 1
  1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces. Shape each
  one into a cylinder 8" long & as fat as a thumb by roling it on a
  lightly floured work surface with the palms of your hands.  The dough
  will be springy & elastic. As you roll each one, cover the others.
  Set the rolls onto an oiled baking sheet & connect the ends, forming
  rings, about 4" in diameter. Pat the tops so they are level, cover
  with a towel & let rise until they are puffy & doubled, about 1 hour.
  Preheat oven to 400F.  Bring a large pot of boiling water to a boil.
  Put the friselle, two or three at a time, into the boiling water.
  Turn them over to submerge both sides, but leave them for only 1 or 2
  minutes in all. Remove carefully & drain on paper towels. Set the
  friselle on oiled baking sheets & bake for 20 minutes until golden &
  toasty. Remove from the oven, let them cool slightly & then cut in
  half horizontally. Set them cut side up on the baking sheets. Reduce
  the heat to 350F & return the friselle to the oven for 15 minutes,
  until crisp & crunchy. Use for bruschetta.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lb Assorted mushrooms *
      3 tb To 5 tb olive oil
      3    Or 4 cloves garlic, chopped
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      1 ts Chopped fresh mint
      1 c  Chopped, well flavored
           -tomatoes **
      6    Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
 
  * Include at least some specialty mushrooms, such as portobello or
  crimini ** Pomi brand is excellent if fresh ones are not available
  
  This mushroom frittata comes from Luca Citi of Cafe Citi in Kenwood.
  
  Slice mushrooms and saute in a few tablespoons of olive oil, then
  season with garlic, salt and pepper, parsley and mint. Add tomatoes
  to the pan and cook down over high heat until there is nearly no
  liquid left. Let cool.
  
  Mix eggs with cheese, then add mushroom/tomato mixture. Heat
  remaining oil in heavy, nonstick frying pan, then pour in
  egg/cheese/mushroom mixture and cook slowly over medium low heat,
  letting the egg cook on the bottom, lifting up the edges with a
  spatula to let the runny egg move to the bottom and cook
  
  When the mixture is partially set and the bottom has browned, either
  invert the frittata onto a plate and then flip back into the pan,
  cooking over medium heat until it too is browned and set, or place
  under the broiler to broil until golden brown and cooked through.
  Serve either hot or cool.
  
  Serves 6 as a first course or lunch dish.

 Categories: Pasta, Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 ts Olive oil;
      4 sl Prosciutto or ham; diced
           -about 1/4 lb
      6 lg Eggs;
      3 tb Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese;
        x  Salt & pepper to taste;
    1/4 c  Basil or parsley; chopped
      2 c  Cooked spaghetti;
  1 1/2 c  Mozzarella or other cheese;
           -cubed (about 6 oz)
    1/4 c  Olive oil;
      4 tb Butter;
 
  In a frying pan, saute the prosciutto or ham in the olive oil until
  crispy. Drain on brown paper. (I used paper towels) In a large bowl,
  beat the eggs. Add the Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper, and
  basil or parsley. Add the spaghetti and mix well, then stir in the
  mozzarella cheese and proscuitto. In a 9-inch frying pan, heat 2T of
  the butter and 2T of the olive oil. Add the spaghetti mixture and
  smooth the top with a spatula. Cook over medium-low heat until the
  frittata is browned on the bottom and set. Invert a plate larger than
  the frying pan over the pan and turn out the frittata. Heat the
  remaining butter and olive oil in the pan, and return the frittata to
  the pan to brown the other side. Shake the pan occasionally to keep
  the frittata from sticking.  Invert a serving plate over the frying
  pan and carefully turn out the frittata. Serve at room temperature,
  cut in wedges. (like a pie)

      Title: FROGMORE STEW
 Categories: Seafood, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Uncooked Shrimp in shell
      4 x  Ears corn on the cob
      4 x  Medium potatoes
      2 lb Sausage (kilbasa, etc.)
           Liquid shrimp & crab boil
           Lemon
      2 x  Medium onions (optional)
 
  Fill a large stew pot about 1/2 full of water.
   squeese lemon juice into pot (throw in lemon rind just for the heck
  of it).  Add as much of the shrimp and crab boil as you think is wise
  (I usually use the whole bottle but my wife can barely stand 2/3 rds
  of a bottle).  Cut potatoes into large chunks and add potatoes and
  corn on the cob.  Cook for about 10 minutes and add cut up onions.
  cook untill the corn and potatoes are done, then add shrimp and
  sausage (cut into "wheels") and cook untill shrimp are done (about 3
  to 4 minutes longer). This is a very hot "stew" and should be served
  with something to cut the heat. I enjoy slaw and some good bread. Hot
  mustard goes well with the sausage and tarter sauce goes well with
  the shrimp. A six pack of your favorate beverage might also be a good
  idea. Hope you enjoy 01/14 09:36 pm Rob Elliotte from Gastonia,NC

 Categories: Puddings, Christmas
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 c  Dried fruits (mixed),
           -finely chopped
      1 ts Orange rind, grated
      2 tb Cocoa
    1/2 c  Brandy or masala
      2 ts Gelatine

  saucepan. Over medium heat, bring almost to a boil, stirring
  occasionally. Cool, stirring occasionally.
  
  Mix gelatine and boiling water; simmer in a small pan for a few
  seconds, until evenly melted. Blend into fruit, chill. Fold the fruit
  into the softened ice cream, blending evenly. Pack into foil lined
  bowl, cover with foil and freeze overnight or longer.

  NOTES:
  
  *  A southern-hemisphere Christmas plum pudding -- We here in the
  Southern Hemisphere have a summer Christmas so we have adapted some
  of the more traditional festive fare to local conditions.  Here is
  one example. It is very easy, and it can be made up to a week ahead
  of using. Yield: Serves 8-10.
  
  *  The original recipe called for the use of a microwave to do the
  heating and cooking. This works well for melting the gelatine but is
  a bit of a nuisance otherwise.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate (timing matters).
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, overnight freezing.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: FROZEN CRANBERRY SOUFFLE WITH SPUN SUGAR CRAN
 Categories: Christmas, Holiday, Desserts
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           -Gourmet Magazine 12/92
           --For the cranberry
           -mixture:
  2 1/2 c  Cranberries, picked over
    2/3 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Water
           --For the Italian
           -Meringue:
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Water
      4 lg Egg whites (I used extra
           -large )
  2 1/2 c  Well chilled heavy cream
           --For the spun sugar
           -wreath:
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Cranberries, picked over
           Mint sprigs for garnish
 
   Make the cranberry mixture: In a heavy saucepan combine the
  cranberries, the sugar and the water and bring the mixture to a boil,
  stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Simmer the mixture, stirring
  occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until it is thickened, and let cool
  completely. (I cooked mine a bit longer).
  
   Make the Italian Meringue:  In a small heavy saucepan, combine the
  sugar and the water and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until
  the sugar is dissolved. Boil the syrup, washing down any sugar
  crystals clinging to the side of the pan with a brush dipped in cold
  water, until it registers 248 degrees F. on a candy thermometer and
  remove the pan from the heat. While the syrup is boiling, in the
  large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with a pinch of
  salt until they hold soft peaks, and with the motor running, add the
  hot syrup in a stream, beating and beat the meringue at medium speed
  for 8 minutes, or until it cools to room temperature.
  
   Fold the cranberry mixture into the meringue gently but throughly. In
  another bowl, with cleaned beaters, beat the cream until it just holds
  stiff peaks and fold it into the cranberry mixture gently but
  thoroughly. Spoon the souffle into a 2.5 qt. freezer proof glass
  serving bowl (8 inch diameter), smoothing the top, and freeze the
  souffle, its surface covered with plastic wrap, overnight. the
  souffle may be made 3 days in advance and kept covered and frozen.
  
   Make the spun sugar wreath: In a small heay saucepan combine the corn
  syrup and the sugar , bring the mixture to a boil over moderate heat,
  stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and boil the syrup until it is
  golden caramel and registers 320 degrees F. on a candy thermometer.
  While the syrup is boiling, oil lightly a 12 inch square sheet of
  foul and on it arrange the cranberries in a 6 inch wide wreath shape.
  Remove the pan from the heat and let the syrup cool for 30 seconds.
  Dip a fork into the syrup and drizzle the syrup over the cranberries,
  repeating this procedure until the cranberries are covered and wreath
  is formed. (If the syrup becomes too thick to drizzle from a fork,
  reheat over moderate heat until it is the right consistency.) Let the
  wreath cool completely. The wreath may be made 2 hours in advance-
  preferably not on a damp day - and kept in a cool, dry place.
  
   Pry the wreath gently from the foil, arrange it on the souffle and
  garnish it with the mint sprigs.
  
   The following recipe is from the December issue of Gourmet Magazine.
  I made this as a dessert for Christmas - but I omitted the spun sugar
  wreath! I did not wish to wait until a couple of hours before dinner
  on Christmas day to make a spun sugar wreath! Instead, I decorated
  the souffle with candied violets.
  
   Also, please note that the recipe gives no suggestion on how long
  before serving from the freezer! If properly frozen, the souffle is
  hard as a rock! I took mine out of the freezer about an hour and a
  half before I planned to serve it - and in reality, it was more. I
  did not leave the souffe in my hot kitchen, but rather in a not quite
  as hot pantry and it was still well frozen, but I was able to cut
  into it to serve! You will have to judge this for yourself as it will
  depend on the the temperature of the room, etc. The souffle will not
  break down, so you won't have to worry about that! By the way, if
  there are any leftovers, the souffle is equally good the next day,
  but of course it is no longer a frozen souffle!

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Milk
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ds Salt
      1 tb Butter
      2    Eggs
      1 cn Milk, condensed
      2 ts Vanilla
 
  Combine milk, flour, sugar, salt, and butter, and cook until slightly
  thickened.  Beat eggs and add slowly to hot custard, beating briskly.
  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly for a few more minutes.
  Remove from heat and add condensed milk and vanilla.  Stir well.
  
  NOTE [from the contributor]:  This is just the right amount for my
  half-gallon freezer.  This was my mother's recipe, and she used to
  call it "Daisy's low-cal custard." The nice thing about it is that
  you usually have all the ingredients on hand. Of course, you can add
  fresh fruits if you like, but I usually make it plain and let people
  use whatever topping they choose.
  
  This recipe is from "The National Recovery Act All-Dessert Cookbook"
  put out by Radio 85, KOA, in Denver. The book is a collection of
  recipes from listeners, I suppose, of this powerful station.  This
  one is from Marcia Wilcoxon of Albion, NE.

      Yield: 1 Batch
 
 
  One cup of sugar to 5 cups of sliced or cut up figs give the best
  results. First chill figs to make them easy to peel (if you wish to
  peel them). Slice and mix with sugar thoroughly and then quick
  freeze. If you would rather use sugar syrup for freezing figs, use 1
  quart of water to 1 cup sugar in making syrup.  Chill before pouring
  over figs. Leave 1 to 1-1/2" head space for fruits packed in syrup.

      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 c  Unsweetened frozen raspberri
           - pureed
      1 ts Lemon rind, or orange rind
      2 tb Frozen apple juice concentr
      2 c  Plain lowfat yogurt

  Vary the fruit juice and fruit puree combinations to develop your own
  creative desserts according to the seasons. It takes almost two cups
  of fruit to make one cup of puree. Bananas can be mashed with a fork;
  other fruits do better in a blender or a Soften gelatin in cold water
  for 2-3 minutes.  Combine gelatin, lemon juice, fruit puree, grated
  rind or seasoning, fruit juice concentrate and yogurt and mix
  thoroughly. Freeze until crystals begin to form around the edges.
  Beat egg whites until stiff. Break up the yogurt mix with a spoon and
  beat with an electric mixer until smooth.  Fold in beaten egg whites.
  Freeze until firm. About 30 minutes before serving, remove from
  freezer to refrigerator to allow dessert to soften. Scoop into
  stemmed dessert dishes for a festive presentation. Note: If desired,
  use 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, cinnamon or cardamom in place of
  lemon or orange rind. Honey may be used in place of the juice
  concentrate. Nutrition (per serving): 93 calories Total Fat 2 g (16%

      Title: FROZEN FRUIT SORBET
 Categories: Digest, July, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 cn Fruit
 
  Hi, Patti and all!  Yes, I am the original poster of the "frozen
  fruit in a can" sorbet.  (For those of you newbies who missed it:
  Take a can of fruit in its juice [peaches, pineapple, etc.], freeze
  it, open can and dump or push* contents into food processor and
  process til smooth. That's it!) Since Patti brought up the can
  freezing question again: aluminum drink cans and steel fruit cans are
  not the same! The drink cans are made of light, flimsy aluminum with
  a pre-planned weak spot - the opening. (I bet that's where yours
  burst, Patti. That's where mine always have!) Steel fruit cans are
  much sturdier and I'VE never had one burst in the freezer. YMMV. :-)
  
  *open both ends of can and use one end as a plunger to push out the
  contents.

      Title: FROZEN GRAND MARNIER SOUFFLé W/HOT CHOCOLATE
 Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           GRAND MARNIER SOUFFLÉ:
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Water
      6    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Icing sugar
      2 ts Pure vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Grand Marnier or other
           -orange liqueur
      3 c  Whipping cream
           HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE:
      8 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
           -chocolate
      1 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Grand Marnier
 
  Combine the granulated sugar and water together in a heavy saucepan.
  Cook, stirring until the mixture comes to a boil. Continue to cook,
  without stirring, until the mixture reaches 240øF on a candy
  thermometer (and is at the soft ball stage when a bit of the syrup is
  dropped into a glass of cold water - about 5 to 7 minutes).
  
  Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks with the icing sugar until light and
  fluffy (use a mixmaster or hand mixer for the best results).
  
  Slowly drip the sugar syrup into the egg-yolk mixture, beating
  constantly. Continue to beat the mixture until it is completely cool
  and very light.
  
  Stir in the vanilla and 1/2 cup Grand Marnier.
  
  Whip the cream until it is light and forms soft peaks. Gently fold
  into the Grand Marnier base.  Pour the mixture into a 10 inch
  springform pan and cover with plastic wrap. Freeze immediately. When
  frozen, wrap well if you are planning to keep it for longer than two
  days.
  
  To make the sauce, melt the chocolate and the cream in the top of a
  double boiler.  Beat well until combined thoroughly.
  
  Stir in 2 tbsp. Grand Marnier and serve hot.  (The sauce may be
  prepared ahead, but it will solidify when refrigerated, so warm it
  again before serving.)
  
  Before serving, place the frozen soufflé (if frozen solid) in the
  refrigerator for 30 minutes to make slicing easier. Run a knife
  around the inside edge of the springform pan and then unsnap the pan.
  Serve in wedges and pass the chocolate sauce separately.

      Title: FROZEN ORANGE TRUFFLE SOUFFLES
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Unflavored gelatin envelope
    1/2 c  Orange juice, fresh
      5    Eggs; separated, room temp.
    1/2 c  Superfine sugar
      1 ts Grated orange zest
      3 tb Orange liqueur (see note)
      1 c  Heavy cream; chilled
      6    Chocolate Truffles
           Strips of orange zest (opt.)
           Whipped cream (for garnish)
 
  Note: Grand Marnier or Orange Curacao are suggested orange liqueurs.
  Wrap parchement paper or aluminum foil collars around six 2/3-cup
  souffle dishes and fasten with tape or string. In a small bowl,
  sprinkle the gelatin over the orange juice and set aside until
  softened. Place the bowl in a pan of hot water and stir occasionally
  until the gelatin dissolves, about 3 minutes.  Set aside in the hot
  water. In a double boiler, beat the egg yolks and sugar over barely
  simmering water until the mixture is light-colored, creamy and warm
  to the touch, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and continue to
  beat until the mixture cools, thickens and forms a ribbon when the
  beater is lifted, about 3 minutes. Stir in the orange zest and
  liqueur.  Scrape into a large bowl and set aside. Beat the cream
  until it is doubled in volume and forms soft peaks. Beat the egg
  whites until they form soft peaks. Stir the gelatin mixture into the
  beaten egg yolks. Place the bowl in a larger bowl half-filled with
  ice and water and stir with a rubber spatula until the mixture begins
  to thicken and mound, 2 to 4 minutes, depending on the type of bowl
  used (metal chills faster than glass or ceramic). Immediately remove
  from the ice water and fold in the whipped cream. About one-third at
  a time, fold in the egg whites until no streaks of white remain; do
  not overmix. Spoon 1/2 cup of the mousse mixture into each souffle
  dish and place a truffle in the center. Divide the remaining mousse
  amoung the dishes to bury the truffles. Smooth the tops, cover
  loosely with waxed paper and place on a tray in the refrigerator
  until set and chilled, about 2 1/2 hours.  Before serving, remove the
  paper collars. Decorate the tops with whipped cream and strips of
  orange zest, if desired. Serve chilled.

  Set oven at 250 degrees.  Grease and flour 2 large baking sheets.
  Trace 4 circles in flour, each 6 inches in diameter. Spread thin
  layer of Swiss Meringue within each circle.  Sprinkle 1 layer with
  sliced almonds. Bake meringue layers in a 200 degree oven 30-40
  minutes, or as slowly as possible, until they are completely crisp
  and dry, but still white.
  
  Combine about 2 1/3 cups of whipped cream with sweetened berries that
  have first been well drained, folding carefully together. Working as
  quickly as possible to prevent meringue from softening, sandwich
  layers with whipped cream mixture.  Place the almond-studded layer on
  top. Place in the freezer for 2-3 hours, or until cake is frozen.
  
  Spread most of remaining whipped cream around sides. With a star
  tube, make a border of rosettes around top of torte with the last of
  the whipped cream.  Place again in freezer. When sides and border are
  frozen, the torte can be wrapped for freezer storage and kept up to 6
  weeks. Serve frozen.

      Title: FROZEN STRAWBERRY DAIQUIRI MIX
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Lime juice
           Which is juice from 2 medium
           Limes
    1/4 c  Water
      1 qt Fresh strawberries -- washed
           And hulled
 
  Combine sugar, lime juice and water in a bowl. Stir to mix, and then
  let stand until sugar is almost completely dissolved, about 15
  minutes (mixture will be thick) In a blender or food processor,
  combine the sugar and lime juice with the berries. Blend until
  smooth, pack into freezer containers, and freeze. The mixture will
  harden to the consistency of a very firm sherbet, so you will be able
  to scoop portions from the main batch, then reseal its container.  An
  alternative method for packing would be to pour the mixture into ice
  cube trays and freeze until firm, then unmold and pack into
  resealable freezer bags. Yields about 4-2/3 cups. For each strawberry
  daiquiri: In blender jar, combine 3 tablespoons rum (light or dark),
  1/4 cup Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri Mix (2 average-sized cubes that
  have been frozen in ice cube trays) and about 3/4 cup of ice cubes (7
  or 8 average sized cubes). Blend until smooth. Most blender jars can
  handle up to 4 servings. For a non-alcoholic frozen drink, replace
  the rum with unsweetened pineapple juice. For a Strawberry Pina
  Colada: In blender jar, combine 3 tablespoons rum (light or dark),
  1/4 cup Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri Mix, 3 tablespoons unsweetened
  pineapple juice, 1 tablespoon coconut cream, and about 3/4 cup of ice
  cubes. For a non-alcoholic version, omit the rum. Source: Oregon food

      Title: FROZEN YOGURT
 Categories: Yogurt
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Yogurt cheese
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 tb Vanilla
      4    Egg whites
      1 c  Fresh strawberries, thinly
           -sliced
 
  One cup of yogurt makes about 1/2 cup of yogurt cheese. But scientists
  don't know how much calcium is lost straining off the whey, so 1/2 cup
  yogurt cheese could contain nearly a cup serving's worth of calcium.
  The calcium in this recipe is figured according to this formula.
  
  It's easiest to make yogurt cheese from yogurt containing pectin.
  These recipes have been analysed using non-fat yogurt. Low-fat yogurt
  may be preferable to some taste buds.
  
  To strain, place a colander lined with cheesecloth in a bowl. If the
  colander has legs, it can stand right in the bowl. If it doesn't,
  rest it on the bowl edge so there is room for the whey to drain off.
  Weight the yogurt down with empty glass jars. Straining takes at
  least six hours. Don't stop until the remaining cheese is about the
  consistency of cream cheese.
  
  Mix yogurt cheese, sugar and vanilla. Whip egg whites until stiff,
  fold into yogurt cheese-sugar mix. Fold fruit into mixture. For best
  results let the mix stand overmight in refrigerator. Freeze according
  to ice cream maker instructions.

      6 tb Butter
      1 pn Salt
           Zest of 1/2 lemon, grated
      1    Whole egg
      1    Egg yolk
      3 c  Farmer cheese
      3 tb Sour cream
      1 tb Powdered sugar
  1 1/2 c  Cake flour
     12    Plums (OR 12 apricots, OR 18
           -large strawberries)
     24    Cubes sugar (optional)
           For plum dumplings:
      3 tb Finely ground poppy seeds
           -(you can use mortar and
           -pestle)
      1 tb Powdered sugar
           For apricot dumplings:
      3 tb Farmer cheese
      1 tb Powdered sugar
           For Strawberry dumplings:
      5 tb Toasted plain bread crumbs
      1 tb Powdered sugar
 
  1.  In a bowl, combine the butter, salt, and lemon zest. Whip until
  fluffy. Add the whole egg, and egg yolk, and continue to beat to
  blend. Beat in the farmer cheese, sour cream, and powdered sugar. Add
  the flour slowly and beat until smooth. Allow the dough to rest for
  30 minutes at room temperature.
  
  2.  Cut the plums or apricots in half and remove the pits, if
  necessary. If the fruit isn't sweet, place 1 cube of sugar in the
  hollow of each half.
  
  3.  On a marble pastry board, roll out dough 1/2 inch thick. Using a
  pastry wheel, cut the dough into a grid of 5-inch squares. If you're
  using strawberries, make
       18    (3-inch) squares.
  
  4.  Place a piece of fruit, cut side down, on each circle of dough
  and pull the pastry up around the fruit. Seal by pinching the pastry
  together.
  
  The dumplings can be prepared up to 3 hours ahead to this point.
  Refrigerate until ready to boil.
  
  5.  Bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil.  Add 8 dumplings and
  simmer until they rise to the top, approximately 15 minutes. Remove
  with a slotted spoon. Keep warm on a covered plate. Repeat with the
  remaining dumplings.
  
  6.  To serve: Plum dumplings:  Sprinkle with poppy seeds and powdered
  sugar
  
  Apricot dumplings:  Sprinkle with farmer cheese, pressed through a
  sieve, and the powdered sugar
  
  Strawberry dumplings:  Roll in the toasted plain bread crumbs and
  sprinkle with the powdered sugar.
  
  ((Note:  My mother used to make these with whole pitted apricots and
  whole pitted plums, always with a sugar cube in the center, and
  always rolling the finished product in the toasted bread crumbs, and
  the sprinkling the dumplings with sugar.  Karin))

   Substitute fructose in recipes calling for sugar. Since it is a
  natural sweetener there should be appreciable change in blood sugar
  levels.
   Fructose does not break down in cooking like some artificial
  sweeteners.
   General rule of thumb is to use 1/3 less fructose thatn the amount of
  sugar called for. It can be used in all diets,but diabetics should
  check with their doctors if there's any doubt about using it.

  all at once in case you don't need it all. This is a little different
  than the usual coleslaw, but very good and easy to prepare. Prepare
  ingredients ahead of time, then put salad together whenever you wish.

MMMMM----------------------APRICOT FILLING---------------------------
      1 x  Recipe BASIC FILLING (above)
      3 c  APRICOTS, dried; lightly
           -packed (Three 6 oz. bags)
      1 ts ORANGE PEEL; grated
           -(instead of lemon peel)

MMMMM------------------------DATE FILLING-----------------------------
      1 x  Recipe BASIC FILLING (above)
      1 lb DATES, pitted;
      2 ts LEMON PEEL; grated (instead
           -of the 1 tsp called for)
 
  Using a food processor or a food chopper fitted with a medium blade,
  grind together the dried fruit and nuts. Turn into a medium-size pan
  and add the sugar, water, lemon or orange peel, lemon juice and
  spices (if called for). Place over medium heat and cook, stirring
  until mixture boils and becomes very thick (5 to 8 minutes). Mine
  never did really "boil", it was more like dry frying. Let cool
  completely. Divide the cookie dough into 2 equal portions;
  refrigerate 1/2 until ready to use. On a floured surface, roll out
  1/2 of the dough to a straight-edged 9 x 15-inch rectangle, cut
  lengthwise into three strips. This wasn't that easy to do, that is,
  until I figured out that my board was exactly 15-inches wide. I
  rolled the dough the width of the board and measured 9-inches across
  using my long ruler. I held the ruler against the sides and used my
  fingers to press the dough into it. This is the hardest part of
  making these cookies. Divide cooked fruit filling into 6 equal
  portions (for the apricots it worked out to 1/2 cup per portion) and
  evenly distribute one portion down center of each strip, bringing it
  out to the ends. Using a long spatula, lift sides of each dough strip
  over filling, overlapping edges slightly on top. ****Original Posters
  Notes: I found this was hard to do so I cut each strip in half, then
  draped the dough over the filling--it never did overlap but that's
  OK. Press together lightly. Cut strips in half crosswise (I did that
  earlier on); lift and invert onto greased baking sheets (seam side
  should be down. Brush off excess flour with a pastry brush.
  Refrigerate for about 15 minutes or until the balance of the cookies
  are made. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or
  until browned. Let cool on baking sheets on a rack for about 10
  minutes; then cut each strip crosswise into 4 pieces. Transfer
  cookies to racks and let cool completely. Store covered. The cookies
  keep well, becoming softer and more flavorful after they have stood
  at least 1 day. MAKES 4 DOZEN Food & Wine RT [*] Category 4, Topic 3

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Fruit bats, well washed but
           -neither skinned nor
           -eviscerated,
           Water
      1 tb Finely sliced fresh ginger,
      1 lg Onion, quartered,
 
  I knew if we were patient, this would become available. For all of
  you who have been waiting patiently to make your fruit bats into
  fruit bat soup, here's a recipe.
  
  The following is a genuine recipe from Micronesia. Fruit bats, or
  flying foxes, are furry, fruit and nectar eating bats about the size
  of small rabbits. The make very affectionate pets.
  
  Sea salt to taste, Chopped scallions, Soy sauce and/or coconut cream.
  
  1.  Place the bats in a large kettle and add water to cover, the
  ginger, onion, and salt.  Bring to the boil and cook for 40 minutes.
  Strain broth into a second kettle.
  
  2.  Take the bats, skin them and discard the skin. Remove meat from
  the bones and return meat, and any of the viscera you fancy, to the
  broth. Heat.
  
  3.  Serve liberally sprinkled with scallions and further seasoned
  with soy sauce and/or coconut cream.
  
  Yield: 4 servings.

  NOTE:  A final word about the Jean Hewitt cookbook. It is now out of
  print so I don't feel too bad about swiping a recipe from it. Despite
  the above it is an excellent cookbook made up from recipes sent in by
  readers to the New York Times, and tested by Ms Hewitt herself. It
  comes from the days when "Natural Foods" did not just mean salt free
  veggie fare, (although there are plenty of first rate, mostly simple
  vegetarian recipes included). If you can get hold of a copy from a
  public library, say, I recommend it.

      Title: FRUIT CAKE (AN OLD GERMAN RECIPE)
 Categories: Cakes, German
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      2 c  Of sugar
      1 c  Butter or shortening*
      2    Eggs, slightly beaten
  1 1/2 c  Applesauce (unsweetened
           -and unseasoned)
      1 ts Vanilla
      4 c  Flour
      1 ts Soda
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Cloves
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 lb Fairly coarse nut meats
      1 lb Raisins **
      2 lb Gumdrops ***
 
  *   Reserve 1 Tbsp butter for frying nut meats ** Bleached small white
  raisins are better than puffed, seeded. *** Gum drops cut more evenly
  if scissors are first dipped into hot water. Use only a few green as
  their flavor is so strong, and NO BLACK.
  
  Cream sugar and butter. Add slightly beaten eggs. Add applesause and
  vanilla. Sift next 6 dry ingredients and reserve 1 cup. Add dry
  ingredients (except for the 1 cup) and mix well. Fry nut meats, heat
  well but do not brown, stir constantly.
  
  Flour nut meats, chopped gum drops and raisins in the reserved flour
  mixture. This is best done by placing all ingredients into a strong
  paper bag and shaking vigorously. Mix with batter.
  
  Line cake pans* with waxed paper. Do not fill pans more than 2/3 full.
  
  Bake in SLOW oven (275 degress) until done. Baking time depends upon
  size of cake. 8 1/2 X 4 inch load requires about 2 hrs. DO NOT
  OVERBAKE. Cake should be farely moist when done.
  
  Remove waxed paper immediately after removing cake from oven after
  baking.
  
  Immediately rewrap COMPLETELY in fresh waxed paper or cellophane.
  This will seal in moisture. (Paper in which cake is baked will become
  set on cake and difficult to remove later when cold.)
  
  *This recipe makes approximately one 8 1/2 X 4 inch loaf cake and one
  8 inch square cake. Cake should keep an indefinite length of time.

      Title: FRUIT CAKE PREPARATION
 Categories: Info/tips, Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  See instructions below
 
  PREPARING PANS: *************** Before you start preparing batter,
  prepare pans. Except when otherwise directed, line greased pans with
  heavy brown paper, so edges don't get too brown or dry and cakes can
  removed from pans easily; grease paper with shortening before pouring
  in batter until batter almost fills the pan.
  
  BAKING: ******* To help keep cake moist, place pan of water in oven
  below cake. Place cake on middle rack of oven. Be sure heat can
  circulate around each pan. Tester inserted in center of cake should
  come out clean but may be sticky with fruit. If top of cake gets too
  brown before it's done, lay foil loosely over top.
  
  STORING: ******** Ripening is a mellowing process in which flavors
  mingle. Ripening takes from 3 to 8 weeks; the more fruit, the longer
  it takes. To speed it up, before baking, mix fruit and nuts with
  spirit and let sit overnight. After baking, make skewer holes in cake
  and pour in a small amount of heated brandy or other spirit. Wrap
  cooled cakes in cheesecloth moistened with brandy, sherry, rum or
  whisky. Wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap, then foil. Place in
  airtight tin and store in refrigerator or in cool, dark place,
  moistening cheesecloth every 2 weeks, if necessary. After cake
  ripens, it can be frozen for up to one year. Thaw in refrigerator for
  24 hours.

  I'm not at all good with desserts. My favorite thing after a big meal
  is fruit. I know, you`re going to say "how boring!"Just give me a
  chance. I have some tricks in my apron pocket! I`ll give you just a
  few ideas now.
  
  GRAPES...why not run them under cold water, dust with regular sugar
  and put them in the freezer for an hour? They won`t last long enough
  on your table to defrost. Try mixing a bowl of different colored
  grapes.
  
  PEACHES....Take about 1 peach per person, especially in the
  winter.(These Chili fruits look great, but their flavor is missing
  something.) Slice them in wedges, sprinkle with cinnamon, add a tbls
  of some liqueur, any flavor and cover and cook in the microwave for
  5-7 min. Serve as you would applesauce with a pork roast. It`s great
  with any roast. You can also make a mixture of fruits for this, pear,
  nectarine,plums...use your immagination. STRAWBERRIES.....The season
  is coming soon and I want you all prepared for this one. It`s the
  best. I can`t tell you how much to make for how many people, because
  no matter how much you make it will NEVER be enough. Wash strawberrys
  well, THEN take off the top or any bruises. (you don`t want to wash
  away any flavor) cut each one in half or thirds if you must. Place in
  a large bowl that has a secure cover or a large jar. Add a few tbls
  sugar and the juice of a fresh lemon or two. Fill your container 2/3
  nearly covering berries.Place the cover on and shake gently. Place in
  refrig for at least 6 hour turning and shaking every hour or so. You
  need not serve anything else with this, just make sure to provide
  juice glasses and a ladle when the berries are done. Then just sit
  back and relax.

      Title: FRUIT JELLIES
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 pt Strained fresh raspberry
           -juice
      1 lb Loaf sugar
      1 oz Powdered gelatin
           Colouring if necessary
      2 tb Cold water
     10    Drops lemon juice
 
  Raspberry Jellies Prepare raspberry juice by crushing the fruit,
  warming it in a bowl over hot water until the juice flows freely and
  then straining through muslin. Soak the gelatine in the cold water.
  Dissolve the sugar in the juice and boil up to 240 F or the soft ball
  stage. Add the lemon juice and gelatine. Re-heat to 240 F and pour
  into a tin previously rinsed in cold water.  If the colour is pale
  add a few drops of cochineal before the end, but fresh fruit should
  give a brilliant colour. When set, loosen the sides with a hot knife
  and stand the pan on a cloth wrung out of boiling water.  Turn the
  jelly out on to a board. Cut into cubes and roll in very fine
  confectioner's sugar. Stand the sweets in a warm place overnight so
  that the sugar crystals adhers. Blackcurrant Jujubes 1/2 pint pure
  strained blackcurrant syrup 1 oz granulated sugar 1 tablespoon pure
  glycerine 6 tablespoon glucose 1 oz powdered gelatine Soften the
  gelatine in a little water. Dissolve the sugar and glucose in the
  juice - very slowly, over gentle heat.  Add glycerine and bring to
  boiling point. Remove from heat, add gelatine and stir until
  dissolved. Re-heat but do not boil. Rinse a 6" sandwich tin with cold
  water; pour the jelly mixture in. Proceed as in second paragraph of
  directions for Raspberry Jellies. This is a very good sweet for
  irritated throats. Fruit Jellies All juicy fruits in season make
  delicious sweets.  Proceed as for Raspberry Jellies, using colouring
  when necessary to enhance the natural tint. Redcurrants, gooseberries
  ~ both green and red - blackberries, hips and pineapples are just a
  few to be tried.  Fresh pineapple must be well cooked if used with
  gelatine, as it contains a natural digestant which dissolves
  gelatine. Two methods of Crystallising: CRYSTALLISING CANDIED FRUIT
  (This is the chapter that the author said to use for crystallising
  the jellies. I assume where it says fruit you would substitute
  jellies.) A sparkling finish is much sought after in this class of
  sugar work, so here are two recipes-one very simple, the other
  correct and of lasting quality. SIMPLE CRYSTALLISING Dip each fruit
  very quickly into boiling water-just in and out-drain it on
  blotting-paper or butter muslin. Have ready sufficient sieved
  granulated sugar spread upon a sheet of paper to accommodate the
  fruits. Roll them gently about in the sugar until completely coated.
  Leave in a dry, warm situation for some hours to reduce any moisture.
  They will have a satisfying appearance, glistening in the light.
  ADVANCED CRYSTALLISING A crystallising tray is much to be desired for
  this purpose, but to improvise, a baking tray, deep and able to
  accommodate two wire cake racks on top of each other, will serve very
  well. Carefully measure how much liquid will be required to cover the
  fruits when they rest in the tin. Place one rack in the baking tin,
  arrange the fruits upon it so that they do not touch each other or
  the side of the pan. Place the second rack feet upwards upon the
  fruits, holding them gently in place. Cut a piece of greaseproof
  paper the exact size of the interior of your saucepan. Fold it across
  and across, then nip the centre point out leaving a hole about 1" in
  diameter. Make a syrup by dissolving 2 pounds of granulated sugar in
  1 pint (20 ounces) of water. This is your basic recipe- increase it
  proportionately if the amount will not cover the fruits in the tin.
  They must be entirely immersed. Bring the syrup to a boil and strain
  it through muslin wrung out in hot water. Return the syrup to the
  saucepan, bringing it up rapidly to 220-225 F, remembering that the
  higher temperature gives larger crystals, and is good for imposing
  fruits, while 220 F gives finer crystals suitable for cherries,
  grapes and nuts. Put the pan where it won't be jarred in the slighest
  degree, covering the actural syrup with the prepared circle of paper.
  Steam will escape through the central hole. Agitation of the pan will
  result in a "grainy" syrup, so tread warily. When slightly cool-about
  15 minutes-tilt the saucepan so that the syrup flows gently around
  and over the fruits held down by the wire cake rack. Cover with a
  cloth and leave for at least 12 hours. Then, if you have a
  crystallising tray, draw off the liquid. Otherwise, gently lift your
  tray of fruits from the baking tin.  In eigher case place the fruits
  in a warm cupboard to thoroughly dry off once more. They should be
  covered with shimmering crystals of a size to suit your taste,
  according to the original temperature of the syrup. You will be left
  with a quantity of syrup which cannot be used again for
  crystallising. It can, however be used to make delicious toffee or to
  sweeten stewed fruits. Used with apples in lieu of sugar, it gives a
  unique flavour to an Apple Cake.

      Title: FRUIT KETCHUP
 Categories: Canning
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     15 lg Tomatoes; skins removed
      3    Apples; peeled/ cored
      3    Pears; peeled/ cored
      3    Peaches; skinned
      3 c  White sugar
  2 1/2 c  White vinegar
      3    Onions; chopped
  1 1/2 tb Pickling salt
      1 lg Green pepper; chopped
    1/2    Celery bunch; chopped
      1 ts Pickling spice *
 
  * Do not put in cheesecloth. Just sprinkle over ingredients. Simmer
  approximately 2 hours or until thick. Yield Approximately 6-8 pint.
  
  To Make a thicker ketchup, I used the following: 20 Tomatoes (instead
  of 15); 4 Large Apples (instead of 3); 4 Pears (instead of 3); 5
  Peaches (instead of 3); 3-1\4 Cups Sugar instead of 3 cups; Same
  amount of vinegar as above; 4 Large onions (instead of 3); 2 tbsp
  pickling salt; 3 Large peppers (instead of one)--I used 2 green and 1
  red for variety; 3\4 Head of Celery; 1 tbsp of pickling spice.
  
  If you prefer a firmer fruit, you would add celery, peppers, onions,
  sugar, vinegar and spices and cook slightly longer before adding
  fruit--especially if fruit is very ripe. Simmer at least 2 hours
  until thick: Yield: 7 QuartsJM.
  
  LAST SEASON I MADE ALMOST 20 QUARTS OF THIS--WE JUST LOVE IT. Sherilyn
  Palmer. Although the second part of this recipe is my own variation,
  this recipe is truly an authentic French Canadian pickle made in most
  parts of Quebec, Canada. Therefore, most French Canadian cooks will
  have a slightly different version of this recipe. From Sherilyn
