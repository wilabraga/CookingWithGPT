      Title: CHICKEN WITH GARLIC
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Chickens or chicken breasts
      2 sm Heads garlic
           Water
    1/4 c  Chopped Italian parsley
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1 lg Lemon; juiced
 
  If using whole chickens, halve chickens and bone completely except
  for wing joint.  If only using breasts, bone completely. Place the
  heads of garlic in water to cover in a small saucepan and bring to a
  boil. Drain. Peel the garlic and cut each clove into paper-thin
  slices. Toss in a bowl with the parsley, and season to taste with
  salt and pepper. Loosen the chicken skin and stuff about 2 teaspoons
  garlic mixture between the skin and the meat. Reserve remaining
  garlic mixture. Set chicken aside. Prepare hot coals in a grill.
  When the coals are ready, grill the chicken 5 to 7 minutes on each
  side, or until the flesh is no longer pink. Do not overcook the
  chicken or it will become dry. Heat the butter in a skillet, add the
  reserved garlic mixture, and saute a few seconds. Add the lemon juice
  and adjust seasonings.  Heat through. Place the chicken on a large
  heated platter and spoon the garlic sauce over it.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH HAM & PROVALONE CHEESE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Whole chicken breasts
      9    Slices cured Polish ham
  2 1/2 tb Seedless raspberry jam
  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice
      3 c  Water
  1 1/2 lb Broccoli
      7    Slices provalone cheese
 
  Use vegetable oil or cooking spray to lightly grease a large baking
  dish. (I used a 9x12" cake tin.)  Remove the broccoli heads from the
  stems. Trim the stems, slice and chop coarsely like celery. Put the
  rice and the chopped broccoli stems in the bottom of the baking dish.
  Spread the ham slices with raspberry jam and wrap them (raspberry
  side down) around all sides of each chicken breast. Arrange the
  chicken breasts down the center of the dish, break the broccoli head
  into pieces and place around the chicken.  Add 3 c. water.
  
  Cover and bake 45 min. at 350'F.  Remove dish from oven (to check
  chicken for doneness, cut into it with a knife or fork -- meat should
  be white, juices should run clear), cover chicken breasts with slices
  of cheese and put additional pieces of cheese over the rice and
  broccoli, then return to oven and bake uncovered another 5-10 min.
  until cheese is melted. It will look & smell wonderful!  Split
  chicken breasts to serve 4-6.
  
  I suppose this is similar to chicken cordon bleu (?), but it seemed
  much easier than stuffing deboned chicken breasts, and the rice and
  broccoli are delicious cooked this way.  I didn't add salt, pepper,
  or other seasonings because the ham I used was so delicious and
  strongly flavored; use your judgement. Asparagus and/or mushrooms
  would probably be good substitutes for the broccoli.  I liked the
  subtle flavor added by the raspberry jam, which was not too sweet;
  probably you could substitute another jam or a small amount of honey.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH MANDARINES & POMEGRANATE
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2    Mandarines
      1    Chicken
           Sprigs thyme
      3    Mandarines, juice only
           Pomegranate, juice only
      1    Pomegranate, quartered,
           -seeds reserved
      1 tb Butter, softened
      1 tb Flour
 
  This very seasonal dish - both mandarines and pomegranates are well
  into their seasons now - is simple but unusual.
  
  Segment 2 mandarines, being careful to remove as much pith as
  possible, and if possible remove the seeds.
  
  Remove the fatty pads from the cavity of a chicken and put the
  chicken in an ovenproof dish, preferably a glass chicken roaster to
  maximise final moistness. Surround the chicken with the mandarine
  segments and a few sprigs of thyme. Halve and juice 3 more mandarines
  and pour the juice over the chicken. Juice half a pomegranate and
  add. Season. Roast in a 190 C oven for about an hour or until the
  juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with
  a skewer. If not using a glass roaster with a lid, baste at intervals
  during cooking.
  
  Meanwhile cut another pomegranate into quarters and twist each wedge
  to help free the seeds. Coax them out and reserve. Work together a
  tablespoon of softened butter and a tablespoon of plain flour (to
  make a buerre manie).
  
  When the chicken is cooked, remove it and the mandarine segments to a
  serving dish and keep warm.
  
  Skim the sauce if necessary, then simmer it and add the beurre manie
  in small pieces, whisking all the time until it is sufficiently
  thickened. Taste the sauce for seasoning and pour over the chicken
  and mandarines. Scatter the pomegranate seeds over the mandarine
  segments and serve.

  little lemon juice and chopped green onions in a bowl.
  
  To make the chicken stock, simply boil some chicken in water until
  the meat is falling off the bones.  Remove the chicken and the liquid
  left is the stock.  To make this soup extra low fat, chill the broth
  and skim off the fat that solidifies on top.
  
  THis is a very simple but very delicious soup.

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 c  Cognac (leftover marinade
           -- sauce from chicken)
    1/2 ts Peppercorns, green
    1/2 ts Peppercorns, pink

           -- (carrots, turnips,
           -- string beans or
           -- zucchini)
 
  For the Chicken: ================
  
       To bone the chicken, producing two servings (or globi) per
  chicken, begin by cutting down along the breast bone, scraping along
  the bone to keep the meat intact. Disjoint the wing and continue
  boning along the wishbone.
  
       Turn the chicken over and cut along the back bone, carving out
  the meat from the bone.  Disjoint the thigh and continue to remove
  the entire half of the chicken with the skin intact.
  
       Cut off the wing at the first joint leaving only the shoulder
  bone attached to the carcass.  Scrape the meat off of this remaining
  wing bone to remove the bone, leaving meat and skin attached to the
  half chicken.
  
       Remove the thigh bone, leaving meat attached to the chicken
  half. Cut around the knob end of the leg, releasing the skin and the
  tendons. Press the leg meat and skin firmly toward the thigh so that
  1 1/2 to 2 inches of the leg bone is exposed.  Cut the knob off the
  end of the leg bone.
  
       Repeat the process with the second half of the chicken.
  
       Marinate the chicken meat for one hour in cognac, thyme and bay
  leaf.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH PORT~ CREAM & MUSHROOMS
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Whole chicken (3 lb)
      1 lb Fresh mushrooms
    1/2 tb Butter
    1/2 ts Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 tb Cornstarch; blended with
      1 tb - of the cream
      1 tb Minced shallots
    1/3 c  Port wine
           -Madeira may be substituted
      1 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Cognac or a good brandy
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Truss the chicken, then dry the outside
  thoroughly and rub with 1 tablespoon butter all over the skin. TO
  BROWN THE CHICKEN: Set the chicken on a rack, breast side up in the
  roasting pan, place in the oven for 5 minutes. Turn on its left side
  and baste quickly with butter, return to the oven for another 5
  minutes. Turn on its right side for another 5 minutes, basting as
  before. TO ROAST THE CHICKEN: Leave the chicken on its right side.
  Reduce oven temperature to 350F. Leave it for a total of 15-20
  minutes, basting it at least every 10 minutes. Salt the chicken, turn
  it on its other side, and cook another 15-20 minutes, basting at
  least every 20 minutes. Turn the chicken breast up and continue
  basting every 10 minutes during the last few minutes it is roasting.
  TO TELL IF THE CHICKEN IS DONE: Prick the thickest part of the
  drumstick with a fork. If the juices come out clear yellow, it is
  done. If not, roast another 5 minutes and test again. As a final
  check, lift the chicken and drain the juices from its vent into the
  pan; if the last few drops are clear yellow, it is definitely done.
  Put the chicken on a warm platter, remove the trussing string, and
  let it sit at least 5-10 minutes before carving so that the juices
  will not retreat into the tissues. It can wait a good 30 minutes with
  foil over it. As the chicken roasts, wipe the mushrooms clean with a
  paper towel, cut off the ends and slice them; if small, leave whole.
  Bring 1/4 cup water to a boil with 1/2 tablespoon butter, lemon juice
  and salt. Add mushrooms, cover and cook for 8 minutes. Separate the
  cooking liquid and save it. Pour the cream and cornstarch and cream
  mixture into the mushrooms. Simmer for 2 minutes. Taste and correct
  seasoning and hold. When the chicken is done, remove it to its
  platter and remove all but 2 table- spoons of fat from the pan. Stir
  in the shallots and saute for 1 minute. Add the port and mushroom
  juices and reduce rapidly while deglazing the pan (scraping up the
  coagulated juices) until the liquid has reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add
  the mushrooms and cream. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, allowing the liquid
  to thicken slightly. Taste and correct seasoning; add more lemon
  juice to taste. Butter the inside of a casserole with butter; rapidly
  carve the chicken into serving pieces and sprinkle lightly with salt.
  Arrange it in the casserole for serving. Warm the cognac carefully,
  do not let it catch on fire. Set the chicken over moderate heat until
  you hear it begin to sizzle; pour the cognac over it and ignite it
  carefully with a match. Shake the casserole slowly till the flames
  have subsided. Pour the mushroom mixture over the casserole, basting
  the chicken. Cover and let it steep for 5 minutes. Do not allow the
  sauce to boil. Serve immediately.

 Categories: Seasonings, Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Roasting chicken
      5    Fresh rosemary sprigs
      1 tb Butter; melted
      1 tb Oil
    1/2 c  White wine
    3/4 c  Chicken stock

           Rosemary sprigs; for garnish
 
  Preheat oven to 400 F.
  
  Put 2 whole rosemary sprigs into cavity of chicken. Truss (skewer or
  tie with string) chicken to secure wings and legs. Brush all over
  with half the butter and oil. Reserve remainder for basting. Separate
  rosemary leaves from remaining stems and place into tucks of wings
  and legs, and on top of breast.  Place chicken, breast side up, in a
  roasting pan.
  
  Roast 30 minutes in preheated oven.  Tip pan to let juices flow out
  from chicken cavity; baste.  Turn heat down to 350 degrees; roast 35
  to 40 minutes longer or until juices run clear. Remove chicken from
  pan to heatproof platter and keep warm.
  
  Place pan on top of stove.  Spoon off surface fat. Bring to a boil,
  scraping up chicken bits from bottom of pan. Deglaze by adding wine
  and stock and continuing to scrape up bits. Cook, over high heat,
  until reduced by half.  Pick out any rosemary leaves. Add whipping
  cream and reduce over high heat until of desired consistency. (The
  longer it cooks, the more flavorful and thick).  Season with salt and
  pepper.
  
  Serve sauce with chicken, garnished with more rosemary sprigs.
  
  A simple but satisfying dish.  Good with rice, glazed carrots and
  steamed broccoli.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH WATER CHESTNUTS
 Categories: Poultry, Chinese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Boneless chicken breasts
           - skinned
      1    Egg white
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 lb Water chestnuts, fresh
           - or canned (drained weight)
    1/2 c  Peanut oil
      1 tb Finely chopped garlic
      2 ts Finely chopped ginger
      1 tb Chili bean sauce
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      2 ts Rice wine or dry sherry
      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Sesame oil
 
  CUT THE CHICKEN into 1/2-inch cubes. Combine it with the egg white,
  salt and cornstarch in a small bowl and put the mixture into the
  refrigerator for about 20 minutes. If you are using fresh water
  chestnuts, peel them. If you are using canned water chestnuts, drain
  them well and rinse in cold water. Coarsely chop the water chestnuts.
  Heat a wok or large saute pan until it is hot and add the oil. When
  it is moderately hot, add the chicken cubes and stir to keep them
  from sticking. When the chicken pieces turn white, about 2 minutes,
  quickly drain the chicken and all the oil into a stainless steel
  colander set in a bowl. Clean the wok and reheat. Return 2
  tablespoons of oil to the wok, add the garlic and ginger, and
  stir-fry for 30 seconds. Then add the water chestnuts, chili bean
  sauce, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar and salt and continue to stir-fry
  for 1 minute. Return the chicken to the wok and continue to cook for
  another 2 minutes. Add the sesame oil, give the mixture a final stir,
  and serve at once.

      Title: CHICKEN YA YA
 Categories: Cajun, Low-cal, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    2 1/2-3 lb chicken skinned a
    1/2 ts Red pepper
    1/2 ts Paprika
      1 c  Finely chopped onions
    1/2 c  Finely chopped celery
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 tb Low sodium Worcesterschire
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Chili powder
      1 tb Reduced calorie margarine
    1/2 c  Finely chopped bell pepper
      1    6 oz can orange juice
      2 tb Honey
      1 ts Grated orange peel
    1/4 ts Hot sauce
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the chicken halves in an
  eight inch baking dish sprayed with vegetable cooking spray. Combine
  the salt, red pepper, chili powder and paprika; mix well and sprinkle
  over the chicken;  set aside.
  
  In a medium skillet over high heat, melt the margarine. Add the
  onions, bell pepper and celery; saute, stirring constantly for five
  minutes. Add all the remaining ingredients. Cook, constantly
  stirring, for five more minutes, or until thge sauce thickens, then
  remove from the heat and pour over the chicken. Cover with aluminum
  foil and bake for 30 minutes. Turn the chicken over and baste with
  the sauce.  Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes longer, or until the
  chicken is tender, basting often.
  
  note:  Rather than use margarine to saute the vegetables, I have used
  Pam, spraying both the vegetables and the pan. Works just as well.
  Also, for a little spicier dish, try using Chinese red pepper instead
  of the ground red and use a Tbsp of hot sauce. I also usually leave
  out the ginger.

  barely done... add the remaining ingredients, cover and simmer for an

 Categories: Cyberealm, Ww, Poultry, Mom's best, Kooknet
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     15 oz Boneless chicken breasts
      1 tb + 1 tsp olive oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      2 cl Garlic, minced
      1 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
      1 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Chopped parsley
  1 1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 ts Chicken seasoning(I added)
      1 oz (2 T) dry sherry
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 c  Nonfat sour cream
 
  1. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces. In a large nonstick
  skillet, over medium high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until
  hot but not smoking. Add the chicken and cook, stirring until
  browned, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and cover
  loosely to keep warm.
  
  2. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil to the skillet. Add the onion
  and garlic, and cook, stirring until the onion begins to brown (3-5
  minutes). Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, until the flour is no
  longer visible, about 30 seconds.
  
  3. Add the mushrooms, chicken broth, parsley, sherry, thyme, and
  pepper, and bring to a boil, stirring, until the mixture has
  thickened slightly. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook until
  heated through, about 1 minute.
  
  4. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sour cream.
  
  NOTE: You can make this ahead of time, reserving the addition of the
  sour cream just before you serve it. I served this over cooked egg
  noodles, with French bread and chunky applesauce, and it was GREAT!

      Title: CHICKKEN A LA MYRNA
 Categories: Main dish, Chicken, Casserole
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -GRAMMIE'S KITCHEN
      1    Chicken; cut up
      1 c  Cream of mushroom soup
      1 pk Onion soup mix
    1/2 c  Dry sherry
      1 cn Mushrooms; (small) or fresh
 
  MIX EVERYTHING TOGETHER and pour over the chicken. Bake at 350
  degrees for about an hour.  You can do almost anything to this recipe
  that you like. I.E., leave out the mushrooms, use fresh, change the
  cream of soup to another flavor, use another wine or leave out . You
  can also use chicken parts and take off the skin. If you use the same
  concoction over a pot roast it will taste completely different. Cover
  the pot roast when you bake;  chicken bakes uncovered.  ( Forgot to
  say that) Anyway enjoy,
  
  This recipe was given to me about 25 years ago by Auntie Myrna
  Waltzer. We first had it at her house. Its great for quick meals and
  for camping. You can use this with the foil technique over a fire.
  Change the flavor of the soup and you change  the dish.

  Heat chickpeas in their liquid and drain. Place in a bowl. Combine all
  ingredients for chickpea dressing and pour over chickpeas while they
  are still warm. Mix well. Cool, cover and set aside. Combine all
  ingredients for green bean dressing. Wash and trim beans, and cut
  into 3/4-inch long pieces. Steam or boil beans until just tender.
  Drain thoroughly. Shake them in a colander until they look very dry.
  Put beans in a separate bowl from chickpeas and pour bean dressing
  over them. Let sit for 5 minutes. Combine the two beans and mix well.
  It's best to let the chickpeas sit in their dressing for several
  hours before mixing them with the green beans so the chickpeas can
  absorb the flavors. Serve cold or at room temperature.

      Title: CHICKPEA CASSOULET WITH TOMATOES & CHARD
 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Onion diced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 pn Red pepper
      2 ts Chopped fresh thyme(1/2 tsp
           Dried)
    1/2 ts Paprika
        x  Pinch saffron threads
           (optional)
      1    15 oz can chickpeas
      2 c  Chopped tomatoes
        x  Freshly ground pepper
      1 bn Chard, leaves only
      1    Box 12 oz spaghetti
    1/2 c  Grated soy cheese
 
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Cook pasta al dente, drain. Saute onion
  garlic, crushed red pepper, herbs, paprika, and saffron (if desired).
  Cook over medium high heat, stirring frequently until onions are soft
  about 8 min. Add chickpeas, 1/2 cup of their liquid and tomatoes.
  Season with pepper. Lower heat and simmer 15 min. If pan becomes dry,
  add a little water to keep it moist.  Steam chard until bright green
  and tender. Remove, chop coarsely, season with pepper and if desired
  salt. Put pasta in casserole, add chickpea-tomato mixture, chard and
  cheese. Toss until well mixed. Cover with foil and bake until warmed
  through, about 20 min. Serve with additional grated cheese if
  desired. Makes 4 to 6 servings (I find it to be more).  Here in Fl.
  it's hard to find chard, so I usually use fresh or frozen spinach.
  Kale would work just as well. You can also prepare this ahead of
  time, then pop into oven and heat for 20 min.
  
  The nutritional info. below will not be accurate because I eliminated
  the oil and real cheese. Per serving: 595 cal; 24g protein; 18g fat;

      Title: CHICKPEA SALAD <T>
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    20 oz cans chickpeas or 4
           1/2 c home-cooked chickpeas
      6    Scallions, trimmed and
           Finely sliced
      2 tb Lemon juice [juice of
           One lemon]
    3/4    To 1 tsp salt
    1/4 ts Finely ground black pepper
      2 tb Minced Chinese (or other)
           Parsley [I used cilantro]
      1    Fresh hot green chili (or
           Green pepper), minced [I
           Used 2 jalapenos]
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  Pour contents of chickpea cans or home-cooked chickpeas into a
  saucepan. Bring to a boil. Drain, discarding liquid. [You can skip
  this step if you've just cooked your chickpeas].
  
  Now that summer's heat is keeping our range-top and oven use to a
  minimum, I thought you might enjoy this salad from Madhur Jaffrey's
  _World of the East Vegetarian Cooking_. It sounds spicier than it
  really is.
  
  In a serving bowl, combine chickpeas with the other ingredients. Mix
  well and set aside, unrefrigerated, for 1 hour. Mix again. Serve cold
  or at room temperature.

 Categories: Salsas, Appetizers, Condiments, Soup/stews
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
    1/2 lb (about 1 1/4 C) dried
           -chickpeas, or 2 1/2 C
           -canned
  2 1/4 ts Salt, plus more to taste
    1/4 ts Cumin seeds or 1/2 t
           -ground cumin
      1    Clove garlic, peeled
      2 ts Extra-virgin olive oil

           -coarsely chopped
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 sm Bunch arugula
 
  1. Pick over dried chickpeas. Rinse and soak overnight in cold water
  with 1 t salt. Drain and rinse. Place chickpeas in a medium saucepan
  and cover by several inches with fresh water. Bring to a boil and
  skim off any foam. Turn heat down to medium and simmer until tender,
  35 to 45 minutes. Ten minutes before chickpeas are done, add 3/4 t
  salt. Remove from heat; let cool in cooking liquid for about 1 hour.
  
  2. If using cumin seeds, toast in a dry pan over medium-low heat
  until they release their aroma, about 2 minutes. Let cool and grind
  to a powder in a spice grinder. Set aside.
  
  3. Chop together 1/2 t salt, the garlic, and 1/2 t olive oil to form a
  paste. Add chiles; chop to combine. Transfer to a small bowl and add
  remaining oil.
  
  4. Drain soaked chickpeas. If using canned chickpeas, rinse.) Combine
  with 1 t chile mixture, or to taste. Add olives, cumin, lemon juice,
  and salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve. The
  salsa can be made 1 day ahead (return to room temperature before

      Title: CHICKPEA SNACKS   (TAKES 2-3 DAYS)
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 ts Salt
      2 ts Onion powder
      2 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Dry mustard
      1 ts Turmeric
    3/4 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Cayenne
      1 pk Artificial sweetner
           (1-gram)
    1/2 lb Dried chickpeas
      5 c  Water
      1 c  Apple juice
      1 c  Vegetable stock
 
  Combine 1 TABLESPOON ONLY of the seasoning mix with the artificial
  sweetener and set aside.
  
  Place the chickpeas and water in a container, add the rest of the
  UNsweetened seasoning mix, and soak overnight in the refrigerator.
  The peas will be more than double in volume, so make sure the pot is
  big enough to hold them.
  
  The next day: Place chickpeas and the (seasoned) soaking water in a 5
  quart pot over high heat. Add apple juice and cook 20 minutes. Add
  vegetable stock and cook until peas are just tender, 40 minutes.
  Remove from heat, drain peas in colander, rinse well, and drain.
  
  Sprinkle peas evenly with reserved sweetened seasoning mix.
  
  Now you can cook them one of two ways. 1. Use a food dehydrator.
  Spread evenly around the trays and dehydrate until peas are dry and
  crunchy, about 20-22 hours. 2. Use an oven. Spread peas on cookie
  sheets or sheet pans and cook at 150 degrees until dry and crunchy,
  about 20-22 hours.
  
  COMMENTS: I didn't have white pepper so used 1 teaspoon black pepper
  total. I tried this recipe both with and without the artificial
  sweetner and it's better *with* it.  Regular sugar doesn't work at
  all. Did not have a dehydrator, dryed them in the oven.  It took 15
  hours one time, 20 hours another.  Must have been the number of times
  I opened the oven door. You have to move the pans from one shelf to
  another and turn them every couple of hours or they won't dry evenly.
  I did not stir the peas.
  
  Maybe Santa will bring me a dehydrator?  Anybody out there in low fat
  land with a brand recommendation? Enjoy!

  tray. Remove any shells or discolored seeds. Bake 5-7 mins, until
  seeds smell nutty and darken slightly. Grind in food processor until
  coarsely chopped. Add chickpeas and process until well mixed. Keep
  mix in food processor. In heavy pot, combine couscous, tomato juice

  balls to form patties about 2 inches wide and
      1/2    inch thick. Brush croquettes with olive oil and place on
  lightly oiled baking tray. Bake 15 mins, turn croquettes over, brush
  with oil and bake another 10-12 mins. You can bake croquettes ahead
  of time, refrigerate and reheat before serving. Serve with Sauce

 Categories: Indian, Instant ind, Vegetarian
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    8oz can of tomato sauce
      2 ts Instant India
    1/4 ts Mashed garlic
    1/4 c  Raisons
      1    16oz can drained garbanzo
           -beans
      1    Piece sliced seitan
 
  Microwaved covered for 10 minutes.
  
  Added: 1 large zucchini, sliced into large triangular wedges.
  
  Microwaved covered for a further 8 minutes.
  
  Served with some yogurt cheese (non-fat yogurt drained for 24 hours
  until reduced to half it's bulk) mixed in, which gives it a creamy
  sauce.
  
  Note that seitan is *not* an authentic Indian ingredient--they would
  use panir, a solid whey cheese curded with yogurt and lemon, but I've
  found that seitan blends nicely with Indian food and of course has
  very little fat.

      Title: CHILAU
 Categories: Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    500 g  Rice, basmati
      4 tb Salt
      4 tb Butter
 
  Wash the rice well in a colander then put it in a bowl with 2 tb salt
  and lukewarm water to cover. Stir and let it soak overnight if you
  can, or at least for 1 hour. The longer the better.
  
  Fill a large saucepan with plenty of water, add 2 tb salt and bring
  to the boil. Sprinkle the drained rice in gradually and let it boil
  vigourly for about 4 to 8 minutes. The time depends upon the batch of
  rice but is ready when if you bit on a grain of rice you consider it
  to be slightly underdone, slightly harder than you would like to eat
  it. Drain quickly and rinse in lukewarm water.
  
  Put 2 tb butter and let it melt in the bottom of a pan, add all the
  rice and stir. Cover with 2 more tb of butter. Stretch a clean cloth
  over the top of the pan, put the lid on the top and lift the corners
  of the cloth up over it.
  
  Leave the rice to steam for 20 to 30 minutes over a very low flame. It
  should be cooked and separate. The crisp, brown, golden crust that
  forms at the bottom is considered a delicacy to be offered firs to
  guest. It is called 'dig'. Remove it with a spatula and serve
  separately.

                               JUICE OVERLOAD
  
  Like many parents, you may consider "natural" fruit juice a healthy
  snack, and if you have a picky eater, you may be tempted to give
  him/her lots of juice to supplement their diet. But young children
  who drink large amounts of fruit juice, apple juice in particular,
  are at risk for severe nutritional deficiencies that can interfere
  with normal growth, according to researchers at the Maimonides
  Medical Center in New York City. Drinking juice throughout the day
  will decrease a child's appetite, making eating problems even worse.
  Juices with lots of fructose and sorbitol sugars can cause diarrhea,
  bloating, and cramps when not fully digested. And kids who constantly
  guzzle juice from a bottle are susceptible to cavity-causing
  bacteria. It's best to give young children real fruits and vegetables
  or water, which is essential for a balanced diet and won't interfere
  with their appetites. If you decide to serve juice, wait until your
  child is a year old and serve it only in a cup as a beverage with a
  meal - not as a snack. Toddlers should drink no more than four to
  eight ounces of juice a day. Older kids should be limited to one or
  two cups daily, each with a meal. *By Jeffrey L. Brown, M.D.,

  Recipe by: The Cuisines of Mexico by Diana Kennedy ISBN 0-06-012344-3
  I had always thought of chile con queso as a Texas dish until I went
  to Chihuahua. It is eaten thereas a vegetable with broiled meats, and
  it is also sered as an appetizer with hot tortillas. The light green
  Anaheim chile with which it is made is grown extensively in the north
  of Mexico and southwestern United States. It is used a great deal in
  the cooking of Chihuahau and Sonora.
  
  Two of the best Mexican cheeses come from Chihuahua--the queso
  Chihuahua made by the Mennonites, living there in settlements, and
  the queso asadero, a very creamy, slightly acidy cheese that is
  layered like the mozzarella. It is always used cooked, and gives the
  lovely creamy stringiness that the mexicans hold in high esteem. It
  is curious that in some parts of the State they use a wild plant to
  coagulate the milk instead of the more usual rennet. I have not yet
  been able to find out what this is--possibly a type of thistle that I
  have seen mentioned in the same connection in an old Spanish cookbook.
  
  Roast and peel the chiles and cut them into rajas (strips) without
  removing the seeds.
  
  Heat the oil and cook the onion, without browning, until it is soft.
  
  Slice the tomato thinly and add it with the rajas to the onions in
  the pan. Cover and cook over a medium flame for about 8 minutes.
  
  Add the milk and water and let the mixture cook for a few minutes
  more.
  
  Just before serving, cut the cheese into thin slices and add, with the
  salt, to the chile mixture. Serve as soon as the cheese melts.

 Categories: Poultry, Spices, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5    Jalapeno chiles, stems and
           -seeds removed, chopped
      1 c  Diced onion
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine

           -Smith apples
      2 c  1/2-inch bread cubes
    1/2 c  Pinon nuts
    1/3 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
 
  Info:  from December 1992 "Chile Pepper Spicy World Cuisine" magazine

  Roast duck with stuffing is as easy to prepare as a turkey or a
  chicken, though it is doubtful that the Conquistadors at the first
  Thanksgiving took the time to stuff the ducks before roasting. In
  these days of lean and no fat meals, many people refuse to consider
  duck becuase it is perceived as being extremely fatty. Several simple
  steps, however, can greatly reduce the fat content. First, if the
  skin is pricked before cooking, much of the fat will drain off.
  Secondly, removing the skin before serving will lower the fat content
  even further.
  
  (1) 4-1/2 to 5 pound duck, remove giblets and neck from inside wash
  and pat dry ground red chile powder
  
  Sprinkle the inside cavity of the duck with salt.
  
  Saute the chiles and onion in the margarine until soft.
  
  Combine the mixture with the apples, bread cubes, nuts, and cilantro,
  and toss gently to mix. Fill the neck and body cavities loosely with
  stuffing. Skewer the neck shut and cover the opening of the body
  cavity with aluminum foil and tie the legs together. To be safe, do
  not stuff until you are ready to cook.
  
  Place the duck on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. With sharp fork,
  prick the skin at 1-inch intervals, being careful not to prick the
  meat or it will dry out. This is to allow the duck to continuously
  self-baste so you can put it in the oven and forget it.
  
  Dust the duck with the chile powder.  Bake in slow oven, 325 degrees
  F., about 3 hours or to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F.

  Spelling The word "chile" is both an adjective and a noun referring
  to the plant and pod of a hot pepper, as in "chile pepper" (singular)
  and "hot chilies" (plural). On the other hand, "chili" or "chilli" is
  a stew-like mixture. "Chili powder" is a spice blend used to make
  chili; it usually contains a combination of dried ground New Mexican,
  Anaheim or Cayenne chile peppers, as well as garlic, cumin and other
  spices.

  To roast chile peppers: Cut a slit near the stem of each chile pepper.
  
  Skewer chile peppers and sear over an open flame, 6" to 10" from
  heat. Turn chilies, until blistered all over (if not removing skin)
  or until slightly burned, but not blackened (if removing skin), about
  8 minutes. Or place chilies on a grilling rack or baking sheet and
  broil in oven 4" from heat for about 8 minutes.
  
  If not removing skin, cool, chop and use immediately.
  
  If removing skin, place chilies in an airtight container or paper
  bag. Seal and let sweat for 20 minutes. When cool enough to handle,
  remove chilies one by one and slip off skins or peel with a paring
  knife.
  
  To prepare chilies for stuffing: Roast and peel chile peppers as
  directed above. Cut a circle around the stem and detach the core with
  the seeds. Carefully scrape out any remaining seeds.
  
  To remove some of the heat from a chile pepper: Wash the chile and
  cut it lengthwise. Remove the seeds and ribs, where heat-producing
  capsium is most concentrated.
  
  Soak the chile flesh in an equal mixture of cold water and vinegar
  before using.
  
  To remove some of the heat from a chile papper recipe: For simmering
  dishes, cut a few slits in a whole chile, skewer it on a toothpick
  and add it to the dish while cooking. Remove and discard the chile
  before serving.

  Recipe by: The Cuisines of Mexico by Diana Kennedy ISBN 0-06-012344-3
  This dish consists of large chiles or bell peppers stuffed with meat
  or cheese, coated with a light batter, and fried. They are served in
  a light tomato broth.
  
  There is alays an exclamation of pleasure and surprise when a cazuela
  of golden, puffy chiles rellenos sitting in their tomato broth is
  presented at the table. If you have eaten those sad, flabby little
  things that usually turn up in so-called Mexican restaurants in the
  United States as authentic chiles rellenos, you have a great surprise
  in store. Here is yet another prime example of the fine feeling the
  Mexicans have for texture in their food: you bite through the
  slightly crisp, rich chile poblano to experience the crunch of the
  almonds and little bits of crystallized fruits in the pork filling.
  Then there is the savory broth to cut the richness of the batter.
  
  Chiles poblanos are imported in great quantities to large centers of
  Mexican population here in the States but very few find their way to
  the East. (Maybe this was true in 1972 when this book was published,
  but these days they are readily available here in Cambridge. To me,
  bell peppers are no substitute.) I am afraid the bell pepper is about
  the only suitable substitute for appearance and size--you can always
  spike them with a little chile serrano.
  
  Assembling the chiles may seem like a long laborious task, but it is
  no more complicated and time consuming than most worthwhile dishes,
  and this dish is certainly worthwhile.
  
  Prepare the picadillo:
  
  Cut the meat into large cubes. Put them into the pan with the onion,
  garlic, and salt and cover with cold water. Bring the meat to a boil,
  lower the flame and let it simmer until just tender--about 40 to 45
  minutes. Do not overcook. Leave the meat to cool off in the broth.
  
  Strain the meat, reserving the broth, then shred or chop it finely
  and set it aside. Let the broth get completely cold and skim off the
  fat. Reserve the fat.
  
  Melt the lard and cook the onion and garlic, without browning, until
  they are soft.
  
  Add the meat and let it ook until it begins to brown.
  
  Crush the spices roughly and add them, with the rest of the
  ingredients to the meat mixture. Cook the mixture a few moments
  longer.
  
  Mash the tomatoes a little and add them to the mixture in the pan.
  Continue cooking the mixture over a high flame for about 10 minutes,
  stirring it from time to time so that it does not stick. It should be
  almost dry.
  
  Prepare the tomato broth:
  
  Blend the tomatoes, with the juice extracted from their seeds, with
  the onion and garlic until smooth.
  
  Melt the lard and fry the tomato puree over a high flame for about 3
  minutes, stirring to prevent sticking. Add the rest of the
  ingredients and cook them over a high flame for about 5 minutes,
  stirring.
  
  Add the pork broth and continue cooking the broth over a medium flame
  for about 15 minutes. By that time it will be well seasoned and
  reduced somewhat--but still a broth rather than a thick sauce. Add
  salt as necessary.

      Title: CHILE-FRIED SQUID (SAMBAL CUMI-CUMI)
 Categories: Indonesian, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Squid
    1/2 c  Diced onion
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      3    Or 4 semi-hot fresh red
           -chiles, minced, or 1
           -teaspoon sambal ulek
    1/2 ts Kosher salt
      2 tb Oil
      1 ts Paprika, if needed
      2 tb Tamarind Water or lemon
           -juice
 
  In its most authentic form, this sambal is bright red with chile and
  quite hot.  If you prefer it a little milder, use fresh chiles that
  are not too hot, such as the milder strain of jalapenos now on the
  market; otherwise, use less chile and make up the color difference
  with paprika.
  
  [Personally, I'd use crushed and soaked annatto seeds. They add red
  color without the paprika taste.  S.C.]
  
  1.  Clean squid.  Remove purplish outer skin and cut sacs into rings.
  
  2.  To prepare in a mortar:  Pound onion, garlic, chiles, and salt
  together to a coarse paste.  To prepare in a blender or food
  processor: Grind together with oil.
  
  3.  In a wok or skillet, heat oil over low heat and add paste. (If
  oil was used in grinding paste, add paste to dry pan.) Cook slowly
  until quite fragrant and oil is well stained with red. Add paprika if
  necessary to enhance color.
  
  4.  Turn heat to medium-high, add squid and Tamarind Water, and cook
  just until squid is done (about 2 minutes). Serve hot or at room
  temperature.
  
  Serves 4 to 6 with other dishes.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      8 lg Chinese leaves
    400 g  Canned sweetcorn; drained
      4    Milk (4-5 tbs)
      2    Eggs, beaten
      2 tb Finely chopped fresh herbs
           - (e.g. marjoram, basil,
           - coriander, etc.)
           Pepper to taste
 
  Serves 3-4
  
  This recipe was given to me by a friend who lived in Chile for several
  years, and it has become a firm favourite. A sweetcorn paste tasting
  of fresh herbs is poached inside a wrapping of Chinese leaves. A
  delicious supper dish. Serve on rice or with noodles.
  
  Steam the Chinese leaves for a minute or two until supple but not too
  soft. Liquidize all the rest of the ingredients together to a paste.
  Divide the mixture into eight and put spoonfuls into the centre of
  each leaf. Wrap up like a spring-roll, with the ends folded in, and
  secure with a wooden cocktail stick. Steam over hot water for 20-25
  minutes until the filling is set.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea HINTS AND TIPS FOR CHILES
 
  In these recipes, the chiles and tomatoes can be toasted by holding
  them over an open flame and charring the peel on all sides, or they
  can be roasted, by placing them under a broiler and turning
  occasionally until charred all over.  In either case, the peppers are
  wrapped in moist cloth or place in a wet bag for a while before
  peeling the skins off. The tomatoes can be peeled as soon as they are
  cool enough to handle. Salsa cruda means Raw Sauces. These are all
  uncooked and based on chiles and tomatoes.

           -sour cream

MMMMM-----------------------CREMA (2 CUPS----------------------------
      2 c  Heavy cream
    1/4 c  Buttermilk
 
  CHILE RELLENOS: Combine the grated manchego, panela and a§ejo cheeses
  in a bowl and reserve.
  
  Working on a towel-lined counter, spread open 1 chile at a time. Mold
  1/2 cup of the cheese mixture in your hands to form a compact
  torpedo-shaped log and place inside the chile. Roll the flesh to
  entirely enclose the cheese, using the towel to help shape a tight
  roll. Place on a platter and stuff the remaining chiles. (They can
  now be reserved for up to 2 days, well covered, in the refrigerator.)
  
  Preheat oven to 350¯F.
  
  Spread the flour on a platter. Beat the eggs with the salt and pepper
  in a bowl wide enough for dipping.
  
  Heat the oil in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat
  until hot. Dip 3 chiles at a time in the flouor, patting off the
  excess so just a fine even coating remains. Then place in the eggs.
  
  Test the oil by dropping in a bit of egg.  If it sizzles immediately
  and rises to the surface, the oil is ready. Drop the chiles, 1 at a
  time, into the oil, putting an extra dollop of egg batter on each.
  Fry 3 at a time until golden brown all over, about 1 1/2 minutes per
  side.
  
  Drain on paper towels. Reheat oil and repeat with remaining chiles.
  
  CREMA: Whisk the cream and buttermilk together. Cover and set in a
  warm place (a gas oven with just the heat from the pilot light is
  fine) for 8 hours.
  
  Crema may be kept in the refrigerator as long as a week.
  
  NOTE: Manchego Cheese: There are two kinds of manchego used in mexican
  cooking - and neither is the high-priced Spanish variety sold in
  upscale cheese shops. There is a hard variety (called viejo) and a
  soft, semifirm, golden one that is an excellent melter. The soft one
  is used most often for cooking. Monterey Jack or muenster can be
  substituted.
  
  Anejo Cheese: Also known as Cotija, is a salty, crumbly white cheese,
  similar to feta in appearance. Romano or washed and dried feta are
  good substitutes.
  
  Panela Cheese: is a mild, milky-tasting, fresh white cheese often
  sold in rounds. A ricotta, farmer's or dry cottage cheese can be
  substituted.
  
  The reason Mary Sue and Susan like to use one part manchego, one part
  panella and one-half part anejo is because they give a greater
  texture and flavor than just one cheese, but is not a hard-and-fast
  rule. They both say to go right ahead and use whatever you happen to
  have in the kitchen, or experiment and come up with you own cheese
  mix.
  
  Serves 6 as an appetizer, 3 as an entree.

      4 lg Eggs
           Flour For Coating Chilies
      4 tb Flour

           Pepper, To Taste
           Oregano, To Taste
 
  * This is enough sauce for six to eight chiles.
  
  Cut the cheese into pieces about 1/2 inch square and 2-1/2 inches
  long. Stuff each chile with one piece of the cheese. Roll each chile
  in flour until well coated. Make a batter by beating the whites of
  the four eggs until they are stiff.  It is very important to use a
  clean mixing bowl and beaters to ensure having a nice stiff batter,
  this sounds unimportant but it will make the difference between OK
  and Great final product. Beat the yolks lightly, fold the yolks into
  the whites and then fold in the four T of flour. Drop the stuffed and
  floured chiles into the batter one at a time.  Pick up each with a
  spoon and transfer to a saucer; then slide from saucer into about
  1-1/2 inches of moderately hot oil in your largest frying pan.  This
  is also important since it will help keep the batter on the chile and
  make for a nice presentation. Baste with hot oil or they may turtle
  before you want them too. Fry until golden brown on each side. I do
  four or five at a time.  Drain the chiles on absorbent paper towels
  and let them stand. Don't worry if the nice puffy coating deflates,
  it will puff up again when heated in the thin sauce before serving.
  Prepare thin sauce by cooking onion and garlic until wilted, in oil.
  Add tomatoes and press through a strainer.  Press canned tomatoes
  through a strainer and combine with onion and garlic. Put in a pot
  and bring to a boil. Season to taste with salt, pepper and oregano.
  At serving time, heat the chiles in the boiling thin sauce for about
  five minutes and they are ready to serve with some of the reserved
  sauce. If you enjoy Chile Rellanos in a restaurant and would like to
  fix them at home give this recipe a try.

      2 lg Banana chilies or New
           -Mexican or yellow wax hot
           -chilies
      3 lg Shallots, peeled and halved
      5    Cloves garlic, peeled
      2    Medium-sized ripe tomatoes
           -(1/2 lb.)
      1 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1 tb Fresh lime juice

  are very hot, you may want to seed them. Dry-frying, a method of
  roasting, is simply frying without fat.
  
  Heat a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Add whole chilies and
  dry-fry for about 4 minutes, pressing down with a wooden spoon and
  turning occasionally. Add shallots and garlic to the skillet and
  continue to dry-fry, turning occasionally. for about 5 minutes, or
  until the chili skins are blackened. Transfer the mixture to a bowl
  and cool. Add tomatoes to the skillet and dry-fry for about 5
  minutes, turning occasionally, or until the skins are blackened. Let
  cool.
  
  Remove stems from the chilies and cut in half lengthwise. (Do not
  remove skins.) Remove seeds if you prefer less heat. Core the
  tomatoes and cut into quarters. (Do not remove skins.) Place chilies,
  tomatoes, shallots and garlic in a food processor and, pulsing,
  process until the mixture is coarsely chopped and salsa-like in
  texture (not pureed). Alternatively, chop vegetables finely with a
  knife. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and stir in cilantro,
  fish sauce and lime juice. (The dip can be prepared up to 3 days
  ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.)
  
  Makes 1 1/4 cups.

      2 tb Chopped suet or veg. oil

      4 tb Chili powder
    1/4 c  Masa
      1 c  Water
      1 tb Paprika
 
  The only way I do beer chili is make a regular pot, extra hot, and
  drink a bunch of beers with it. Very satisfactory that way.
  
  Let it be noted that I disagree with many of the particulars of the
  recipe below, but it's a good example of a beer chili.
  
  Brown beef and onion in fat. Add peppers, tomato, beer, stock, cumin,
  garlic, pepper, and half the chili powder. Simmer until meat is done,
  about 2 hr. Make a paste of the masa and water. Stir this quickly
  into the chili. Add the paprika and the rest of the chili powder.
  Cook 15 min. Remove Jalapenos and serve.

 Categories: Hamburger
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground beef
      1 md Ripe tomato, seeded and cut
           -into 1/4" dice
    1/2 c  Pitted black olives, chopped
      1 ts Finely minced garlic
    1/2 ts Dijon-style mustard
      1 tb Chili powder
    1/4 ts Dried basil
    1/4 ts Dried oregano
           Finely grated zest of 1
           -lemon
      2 tb Chopped fresh dill or
           -parsley
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper,
           -to taste
      4    Toasted hamburger buns
    1/3 c  Sour cream, for garnish(opt)
      3    Scallions (3" of green left
           -on), thinly sliced (for
           -garnish), (opt)
 
  While gorund turkey and ground lamb give new excitement to burgers,
  beef is still the meat of choice for Chili Burgers. (Use a light
  touch when mixing beef with other ingredients. If you overmix, the
  burgers will be too dense in texture.) Fresh lemon zest and dill add
  a bright flavor to the robust chili spices. Garnishes are optional,
  but it's fun to serve burgers with all of your favorite chili
  toppings.
  
  1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.
  
  2. Place beef in a bowl and mix well with the tomato, olives, garlic,
  mustard, chili powder, basil, oregano, lemon zest and dill. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper. Gently form the mixture into 4 patties.
  
  3. Grill the burgers over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 4
  minutes per side for rare meat.
  
  4. Serve immediately on buns. If desired, top with sour cream, sliced
  scallions and grated Monterey Jack cheese.

      2    16oz cans S&W Chili Makin's
           (or any other premade, ff,
           Veg chili)
      9 oz Ff, grated cheese
      6 oz Bag ff, baked corn chips
 
  Simply layer the chili, then chips, then cheese. (Usually good for two
  layers :)  Heat in oven at 350 or 375 until cheese is melted and
  chili is warm. Serve with additional corn chips if desired.
  
  (Since so many ppl seem to be confirmed SAD and/or m**t eaters, I
  often add one box/package prepared Heartline Meatless Meats to the
  chili before layering. It has fooled everyone to date with no
  complaints :)

      Title: CHILI CHEESE BITES
 Categories: Snacks, Appetizers
      Yield: 32 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
      5 ea Eggs
    1/4 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 ds Salt
      4 oz Chilies, green, chopped
      1 c  Cottage cheese, small curd
      8 oz Monterey Jack, shredded
 
  Preheat oven to 400.  Melt butter in 9" square pan in oven. Tip pan
  to coat bottom with melted butter.  In large bowl, beat eggs. Stir in
  flour, baking powder, and salt. Add melted butter; set pan aside.
  Stir in chilies, cottage cheese, and cheese. Blend well. Turn batter
  into pan. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees. Bake 30-35
  minutes longer or until lightly browned. Cool slightly and cut into
  small squares.
  
  May be frozen.  If you freeze, flash freeze.  Flash freeze means to
  freeze food uncovered until solid, then wrap well and return to
  freezer. Use within 2-3 months. How to thaw: Place on baking sheet.
  Thaw 1-2 hours at room temperature.  Before serving, reheat in
  400-degree oven 10 minutes or until hot.
  
  Note: The recipe may be doubled and baked in a 13"x9" baking dish.
  
  Sylvia's notes: As usual, I didn't have the right size pan, so baked
  it in two pie pans for 15 minutes at 400 and then 15 minutes at 350.
  They were just a hair too well browned. Quite tasty and would work
  well as a potluck where they could be kept warm or nuked.

      Title: CHILI COLORADO
 Categories: Chili
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6    Dried ancho or pasilla
           -chilies
      3 lb Beef chuck, cut in cubes
      1 lg Onion, chopped
           -
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    3 tbs chili powder
           -(unsalted)
  3 1/2 c  Boiling beef broth
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      4    Cloves garlic, crushed
           -chopped
      2 ts Ground cumin seed
      1    2 tbs cornmeal (optional)
 
  Ancho chilies (sometimes called pasilla chilies) are sweet and fairly
  mild. In this recipe, they give the chili a rich, dark color and
  provide a unique, slightly spicy flavor. Remove stems and seeds from
  chilies. Coarsely chop chilies. Place in bowl, cover with boiling
  beef broth and let steep for 30 minutes. Heat oil in large Dutch
  oven, add onion and cook, stirring constantly, until soft and lightly
  browned. Add garlic, salt and beef cubes.  Cook, stirring constantly,
  just until beef loses its pink color. Strain chilies, reserving
  liquid and chilies. Stir 2.5 cups of chili liquid into beef.  Stir in
  chili powder and ground cumin seed and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat
  and simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat for 1 hour, stirring
  occasionally. Place soaked chilies and remaining liquid in blender
  container, cover and blend until smooth. (If necessary, add 1/2 cup
  more of water to make blending easier.) Add mixture to beef and cook
  over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until
  meat is tender. If a thicker chili is desired, gradually stir in
  cornmeal 1 tbs at a time then cook, stirring constantly, until
  thickened. Taste and season with salt as desired. Remove from heat
  and ladle into bowls. Serve with a variety of condiments such as
  chopped yellow peppers, red onions, tomatoes, avocado, fresh lime
  juice or grated cheese. From: Fleurette Delisle Date: Mon, 01-1

MMMMM----------------------CHILI CON CARNE---------------------------
 
  =========================> Information <=========================
  
  Chili con carne, disclaimed by Mexicans as "a detestable food with a
  false Mexican title"  is nevertheless, a true Mex-American child of
  the border. It originated in towns like San Antonio, where poor
  Mexican families made a little meat go a long way with lots of chili.
  J. C. Cooper, first described the dish in 1828 as a "kind of hash
  with nearly as many peppers as there are pieces of meat."  In 1880s,
  however, the dish became fashionable when sporting ladies known as
  "chili queens" dished out chili from open-air stalls around Alamo
  Plaza at night for San Antonio on the prowl for a hot dish. The Texas
  fashion went national when Texas set up a state chili booth at the
  1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago and when a German, named William
  Gebhardt who had operated a cafe in New Braunfels, Texas, exploited
  the new taste in 1908 by canning the stuff.
  
  Ever since then, prize-winning recipes at the annual Chili Cookoffs in
  rival Tropico, California, and Terlingua, Texas, rely heavily on
  canned tomatoes and premixed commercial chili powder. New Mexicans,
  on the other hand, insist of freshly made chili pulp or at least pure
  ground chili.

 Categories: Vegetables, Odd, Chilies, Hot
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Chilies come in many shapes
           -and sizes, but one thing
           -they all are....HOT!
           -Some are hotter than
           -others, some mildly hot,
           -but they add excitement to
           -a variety of nationalities
           -cookery.  Interestingly
           -enough, although many
           -chilies are sold when they
           -are various shades of
           -green, yellow, or red,
           -they will all turn red if
           -left of the vine long
           -enough. Major varieties
           -include Caribe and Flaoral
           -Gem which are yellow
           -chilies; Fresno which is
           -light gree; Jalapeno, a
           -dark green chili: Verde or
           -Anaheim, the longer
           -shaped green chili which is
           -used in preparing chili
           -relleno; Pasilla, a
           -dark green, pointed chili;
           -and the tiniest but hottest
           -all, the
           -Serrano chili.  Many are
           -available all year.
 
  HOW TO CHOOSE AND STORE: Chilies should have bright, shiny skins and
  shouldn't be shrivelled. Store in the refrigerator.
  
  BASIC PREPARATION FOR COOKING: In commercial canneries, the tough
  though thin skin of the chilies is removed either in a lye bath or in
  huge blast furnaces which rush the chilies through and char the
  outside skin without harming the meat at all. In the kitchen, though,
  thses methods are a bit extreme! There ARE easier ways. If you are
  preparing one or two chilies, spear them with a fork and char the
  skin over the surface unit of your range. Rotate until the skin is
  black or blistered. Put in a small paper sack and close the sack for
  a few minutes to let the chilies steam. Slip off the skin. If you are
  doing anumber of chilies, here is another method.
  
  BROILER METHOD: Spread chilies on broiler pan under high heat. Turn
  chilies frequently until charred or blistered. Put in paper bag for
  15-20 minutes. Remove skins, trim off stem and remove all see and
  veins. (The seeds are the hottest part of the chili.)
  
  **NOTE OF CAUTION** The juice of chili peppers is not only hot
  enought to light a fire in your food, but it can also cause a lot of
  discomfort if rubed on the skin. Always remember to wash your hands
  thoroughly after cutting or handling chilies. If you have ever
  inadvertently rubbed your face or eyes with chili juice on your
  hands, you know what we mean! If you're using freshly chopped chilies
  in salads, sauces or vegetables, chop them as finely as possible. A
  tiny morsel goes a long way.

 Categories: Ethnic, Vegetables, Chili
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    1/4 c  Large dried lima beans
    1/2 tb Light vegetable oil
    1/4 ts Cumin seeds
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      2    Garlic cloves, peeled,
           -crushed
      1    Half-inch piece fresh
           -ginger, peeled
    1/2 c  Peeled, chopped tomato
      2 tb Flaked coconut
      2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
  2 1/2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
      1 tb Chopped fresh dill
 
  Dalnas are the ingenious creations of cooks from Orissa, in eastern
  India. Traditionally, the dish is prepared with yellow mung beans,
  but I have created this recipe using readily obtainable large lima
  beans. To round out the menu, accompany this robust stew with rice
  pilaf.
  
  Rinse lima beans. Soak in water to cover for 6 hours, or overnight.
  Drain and rinse again. Set aside.
  
  Heat oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add cumin,
  onion, garlic and ginger. Stir and cook until onion starts to brown,
  about 4 minutes. Add tomato, coconut and cilantro, reduce heat and
  cook until tomato is soft. Transfer to a blender, add 1/4 cup of the
  water and blend until smooth. (If necessary, add more water to
  facilitate blending.)
  
  Combine beans, tomato-onion mixture and remaining water in a heavy 2
  quart saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, cover, and
  cook until beans are tender, but still hold their shape, about 1
  hour. Add cayenne, paprika and salt. Mix thoroughly. Garnish with
  fresh dill.

      Title: CHILI PASTE (PUREE)
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
  :          see below
  
  Any combination of: 6 ounces dried Ancho, Chipolte, Cascabel, or other
  chiles
  
  Remove the stems and seeds from your choice of dried chiles. Pour
  boiling water over the chiles
  
  to cover and soak 30 minutes. Drain the chiles and puree them
  thoroughly in a food mill or food processor fitted with a metal
  blade. If you use a food mill, the result will be a smooth paste. If
  you use a food processor, you may want to press the paste through a
  sieve to produce a totally smooth paste. The paste can be stored,
  covered and refrigerated 10 days to 2 weeks; if covered with oil, it
  will keep in the refrigerator several months.

        6    dried New Mexico hot
  :          peppers
        6    dried Chipotle peppers
        3    Pasilla Negro peppers
        2    Mulato peppers
        6 TB cumin seed
        6 TB coriander seed
        1 TB whole cloves
        3 TB celery seed
        2 TB ground Cayenne
  
  Mike Smith <michael@databank.com> http://www.charisma.com/~michael/ 1.
  Break up the New Mexico, chipotle, and mulato chiles. Toast the
  chiles in small batches on an ungreased skillet, or comal over medium
  heat until they just begin to release their aroma. Do not let them
  darken or the may become bitter. 2. Toast the cumin, coriander, and
  cloves on an ungreased skillet, or comal over low heat until they
  release their fragrance and become lightly roasted, about three
  minutes. 3. Grind the toasted spices and celery seed (best to use a
  spice grinder). 4. Grind the chiles in a spice grinder or food
  processor. 5. Mix the ground chiles, spices, and ground cayenne. This
  receipe is an adaptation of one appearing in "New Southwestern
  Cooking" by Dille & Belsinger. Since I never have the chiles called
  for in the receipe, I invariably "wing it." The spices seem to be the
  important factor so substituting different chiles doesn't make a
  major difference in the finished product. >From Glen Hosey's Recipe

  you can, so the sauce will be thick and not runny. When the tomatoes

      Title: CHILI WITH BEANS
 Categories: Mexican, Beef, Meats, Chili, Beans
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 pk Pinto beans
      2 lb Chili meat OR
      4 lb Lean beef sirloin, chopped
           In 1/2 inch cubes
      1 lb Low-fat turkey sausage
      1 c  Onions, chopped
      1 tb Garlic powder

      1 ts Louisiana (or Tobasco) Hot
           Sauce
      1 cn Jalapenos, chopped
    1/2 tb Salt
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Michael Gallagher Bob, here is my
  variation of a chili recipe with beans in it. If the people here
  don't like beans with their chili, I'll give a substitution. DON'T
  change anything, for this is the way you should make authentic Texas
  chili--not the cheap imitation stuff.
  
  Wash beans in colander and soak overnight. Wash again next day, and
  place in large chili pot. Cover with water about 1/2 to 3/4 inch over
  beans; simmer, covered, for about 2-1/2 hours or until done.
  
  If substituting beans with the lean beef sirloin, brown the meat 1
  pound at a time, preferably in a non-stick skillet without any oil.
  Place the meat in large chili pot. You will also need 1 more 12 ounce
  can of tomato sauce and 1 to 2 10 ounce cans of fat-skimmed beef
  stock. You will add the extra can of tomato sauce and the can of beef
  stock in the next paragraph of directions.
  
  Brown meat and place in large saucepan. Add all of the other
  ingredients and spices. Mix well. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour. When
  beans are done, add contents of saucepan to chili pot and simmer for
  30 to 45 minutes. Makes 15 to 20 servings, 225 calories each (205
  with out the oil). Salt and pepper to taste.

  tend to add some seaweed while cooking (dump in a bowl so you can use
  the bean pot for frying) roast the cumin in a frying pan (optional,
  but valuable) I used about 2 to 3 tsp chop onions and garlic, saute
  in oil chop peppers, saute with onion & garlic add chopped tomatoes,

 Categories: Thai, Condiments, Dips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 lg Banana chilies or New
           -Mexican or yellow wax hot
           -chilies
      3 lg Shallots, peeled and halved
      5    Cloves garlic, peeled
      2    Medium-sized ripe tomatoes
           -(1/2 lb.)
      1 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1 tb Fresh lime juice
 
  Serve as a dip with raw vegetables or as a condiment. If the chilies
  are very hot, you may want to seed them. Dry-frying, a method of
  roasting, is simply frying without fat.
  
  Heat a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Add whole chilies and
  dry-fry for about 4 minutes, pressing down with a wooden spoon and
  turning occasionally. Add shallots and garlic to the skillet and
  continue to dry-fry, turning occasionally. for about 5 minutes, or
  until the chili skins are blackened. Transfer the mixture to a bowl
  and cool. Add tomatoes to the skillet and dry-fry for about 5
  minutes, turning occasionally, or until the skins are blackened. Let
  cool.
  
  Remove stems from the chilies and cut in half lengthwise. (Do not
  remove skins.) Remove seeds if you prefer less heat. Core the
  tomatoes and cut into quarters. (Do not remove skins.) Place chilies,
  tomatoes, shallots and garlic in a food processor and, pulsing,
  process until the mixture is coarsely chopped and salsa-like in
  texture (not pureed). Alternatively, chop vegetables finely with a
  knife. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and stir in cilantro,
  fish sauce and lime juice. (The dip can be prepared up to 3 days
  ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.)
  
  Makes 1 1/4 cups.

      Title: CHILI-CILANTRO DRESSING (MCDOUGALL)
 Categories: Digest, Jan., Mcdougall
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    4-ounce can of chopped
           Green chilies
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
    1/4 c  Water

  Place all of the ingredients in a food processor or blender. Process
  until smooth.
  
  Note: I copied the above.  I used fresh green chilies, dry cilantro
  from a jar ( a little less than 1/4 cup), lemon juice instead of
  lime, and no pepper.  EVERYONE loved the dressing.
  
  Enjoy.  And I definitely recomment the New Mcdougall cookbook. The
  recipes are not complicated and there is something for everyone.

      Title: CHILIES
 Categories: Info/tips, Mexican, Chili
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No Ingredients
 
  Chilies belong to the capsicum family, as do sweet peppers, but there
  the relationship ends, for the fiery heat of the chili is in no way
  similar to its mild-flavored relation. Fresh chilies are now widely
  available and vary considerably in size, shape and heat factor. In
  principle, the fatter chilies tend to be more mild than the long,
  thin varieties, and the smaller the chili, the hotter its taste.
  Generally, the unripened, green chili is less fiery than when ripened
  and red. This is a useful guide to follow, but there are exceptions
  according to the variety, so it is wise to remember that all chilies,
  irrespective of color, shape and size, are hot, so use caution before
  adding them to a dish. Bear in mind that a little chili goes a long
  way, so add a small amount to begin with and gradually increase the
  quantity to your liking during cooking.
  
  Take care when preparing chilies - the tiny, cream-colored seeds
  inside are the hottest part and, in general, are removed before
  using. Chilies contain a pungent oil which can cause an unpleasant
  burning sensation to eyes and skin, so it's a wise precaution to wear
  rubber gloves when handling chilies and be sure not to touch your
  face and eyes during preparation. Cut off the stalk end, then split
  open the pod and scrape out seeds, using a pointed knife, and
  discard. Rinse pod thoroughly with cold running water and pat chili
  dry before chopping or slicing as required. Once this task is
  completed, always wash your hands, utensils and surfaces thoroughly
  with soapy water.
  
  Dried red chilies are sold whole and can vary in size from 1/2-3/4 to
  1-1/2-2 inches in length, so this into account when using. If a recipe
  states small dried chilies, and you only have the larger ones, adapt
  and lessen the quantity accordingly, or to taste. Dried chilies are
  usually soaked in hot water for 1 hour before draining and removing
  seeds as described above), unless a recipe states otherwise.
  
  Dried red chilies, when ground, are used to make cayenne pepper and
  combined with other spices and seasonings, also make chili and curry
  powder, and chili seasoning. They are also used in the making of
  hot-pepper sauce and chili sauces.
  
  The Harissa spice mix uses a large quantity of dried chilies and is
  very hot, so be forewarned! This is a favorite spice mix for many
  Middle Eastern dishes. Don't be tempted to add more Harissa than
  recipe states, unless you are prepared for an extremely hot dish. A
  less fiery Harissa can be made simply by removing the seeds from
  soaked chilies before crushing chilies with other ingredients.
  
  Green chilies are available canned. These are often seeded and peeled
  and taste pleasantly hot and spicy - ideal for adding to pizza
  toppings, sauces and taco fillings. Both red and green chilies also
  come pickled in jars (hot or mild/sweet) and can be found in
  delicatessens and ethnic food shops. Canned and pickled varieties
  should be drained and patted dry before using. Whether you seed the
  pickled type is up to you, just remember the seeds are the hottest
  part!

MMMMM------------------WHOLE CHILE POWDER BOOK-----------------------
 
  If you are still looking for the sort of ground chile to use in a
  chili powder concoction, you should keep your eyes open for Chimayo
  and Dixon types of New Mexico chile powder. Pendery's is reputed to
  have one of the best selections of chiles and Mexican herbs and
  spices in the USA.
  
  Pendery's has a wonderful variety of chilies, chili powders (pure
  chilies) and chili powder mixes.  They also have some nice spices.
  The prices tend to promote quantity buying. 1 lb is only slightly

  THE BEST WAY TO PEEL these peppers is to fry them in oil and then
  plunge into ice water (see column). Carefully remove the skin,
  keeping the cap and flesh whole. Make a slit down one side, and
  carefully cut out the seeds. Rinse the peppers in cold water, and
  drain on paper towels. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over
  medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and saute, stirring
  constantly, for 3 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and add the
  basil, thyme, rosemary, parsley, salt, pepper, goat cheese and
  mozzarella. Mix well, and form the mixture into 6 cylinders the same
  size as the peppers. Place one cylinder of the mixture in each
  pepper, skewer the peppers shut with toothpicks, and chill for 1
  hour. Heat the oil to 375F. Beat the egg with the milk, and dip the
  filled peppers. Roll in flour, and fry in the hot oil until brown,
  turning gently with tongs. Remove with tongs, drain on paper towels,
  and serve immediately, accompanied by salsa, if desired. NOTE: The
  peppers can be completed up to step 3 a day in advance and
  refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic wrap.

    1/8 ts Each, cumin, allspice, nutme
 
  Recipe by: Jo Merrill * Peel, core, cut into eighths and set aside in
  lemon water. Remove apples from water and place in 4-quart stock pot
  with half the Reisling, half the Calvados and all remaining
  ingredients except the cream and yogurt. Bring to a boil, and reduce
  to a simmer. Cook for 20-30 minutes.  Remove from heat and force
  contents of pot through strainer. Puree ingredients that remain in
  strainer and return to the liquid. Chill soup over ice.  Whisk in
  yogurt and cream and serve in iced glasses. Note: This recipe did not
  say what to do with the remaining Reisling and Calvados. I think it
  would be added after the soup is chilled if you wish a stronger taste
  of those 2 ingredients. This recipe is from the world famous Prince

      Title: CHILLED GARBANZO & POTATO SALAD WITH ONION
 Categories: Pulses and, Salads, Sauces and, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Red Potatoes -- * see note
      3    Italian Plum Tomatoes --
           (red-ripe)
    1/2 md Red Onion -- minced
     16 oz Can Garbanzo Beans
    1/4 lb Fresh Spinach -- ** see
           Note
           -----The Dressing-----
      1 tb Extra Virgin Olive Oil
      2 tb Red Wine Vinegar
      4    Cloves Garlic -- minced
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Fresh Ground Black Pepper
      1 tb Fresh Parsley -- minced
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Crushed Dried Hot Red
           Chilies -- (or to taste)
 
  * small red potatoes, scrubbed and cut into bite-sized pieces **
  washed and finely chopped (optional)
  
  First, mix all the stuff together for the dressing in a small bowl or
  a measuring cup. Let that sit for at least a few minutes usually, if
  you make it first, then do the potatoes and tomatoes, that's plenty
  of time.
  
  Next, bring about 4-6 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan (more is
  better, but leave room for the potatoes), and add the scrubbed
  bite-sized potato pieces. Bring back to a boil, and boil for 4-5
  minutes. Do not overcook! You don't want them to be hard, but you
  don't want them to be mush, either. Drain the potatoes, and rinse
  well under cold water (or cover with cold water, then drain and
  rinse).
  
  Drain the garbanzo beans and rinse them thoroughly under cold water.
  
  Cut the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces, but smaller than the potato
  pieces. Chop up the spinach (if you're using it). Mix everything
  together, including the dressing, in a bowl that is big enough to
  stir it without dumping bits over the side.
  
  Cover the bowl, and chill for at least 4 hours, tossing it once or
  twice to make sure the dressing continues to coat things.
  
  Adapted by Ron Lunde, from: Shea MacKenzie's The Garden of Earthly
  Delights Cookbook
  
  My modifications to this recipe were to increase the garlic, cut back
  a lot on the oil, increase the potatoes, omit the sweet bell pepper,
  and add an extra plum tomato. This is my favorite potato salad.

  serving dish, conserving any juice. sprinkle with the zest and about
  2 tablespoons orange-flower water, dust with icing sugar, cover with
  cling film and leave to macerate in the refrig- erator for a couple
  of hours. Taste the juices and adjust if necessary with sugar or a
  little lemon juice. Chill again and serve.

    1/2 oz Chunk semi-sweet chocolate;
           -finely grated
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
 
  EQUIPMENT:  Measuring cup, measuring spoons, hand grated, 2 1/2-qt
  saucepan, electric mixer with paddle, and balloon whip, rubber
  spatula, whisk, instant-read test thermometer, 2 stainless steel
  bowls (1 large), pastry bag, 8  8-oz coffee cups
  
  Heat 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and the half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt
  saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. While the cream is
  heating, combine the egg yolks, eggs, sugar, cornstarch, and instant
  espresso powder in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
  paddle. Beat the mixture on high for 2 minutes, scrape down the sides
  of the bowl, and continue mixing on high until the mixture is
  slightly thickened, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. (At this point the
  cream should be boiling. If not, adjust the mixer speed to low and
  continue to mix until the cream boils. If his is not done, the eggs
  will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour the boiling cream into the
  beaten egg mixture and whisk to combine. Return to the saucepan and
  heat over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until the cream
  reaches a temperature of 180 degrees, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove
  from the heat and transfer to a stainless steel bowl. Cool the
  espresso-custard mixture in an ice-water bath to a temperature for 40
  to 45 degrees, about 20 to 25 minutes.

MMMMM-------------------HERBED TORTILLA CRISPS------------------------
      3 lg Flour tortillas
           - cut into 12 sections each
      2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
      1 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  IN THE BOWL of a food processor fitted with a steel chopping blade,
  combine the peppers and garlic, and puree until smooth. Scrape the
  mixture into a large non-aluminum bowl. Add the chicken stock,
  buttermilk, sugar, salt, corn, nopales, oregano, and Tabasco, and
  stir to blend. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour. In a small bowl,
  combine the yogurt and oregano. Cover and refrigerate. TO MAKE THE
  CRISPS: Turn on your broiled, and position the rack at least 5 inches
  from the heat. Lightly brush the top of the tortilla wedges with oil.
  Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Sprinkle on the oregano,
  crumbling it with your fingers as you do this, then drizzle on the
  Parmesan cheese. Run them under the broiler, just to crisp and color
  lightly, watching so they do not burn. Before serving, ladle the soup
  into bowls. Add about a tablespoon of the yogurt in the center.
  Sprinkle on chopped oregano and serve with the tortilla wedges. NOTE:
  Although Tex-Mex and other Latin delicacies are now available in many
  markets across the country, pickled nopales or tender cactus leaves
  are less available than jalapeno peppers, for example. If you cannot
  find them, either chop a few pickled jalapeno peppers (with the seeds
  removed) or simply omit them.

 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Whole cleaned trout
           (each about 1/2 lb.)
           Basic poaching liquid
           Parsley sprigs
           Lemon wedges
      1 c  Sour cream
      4 ts Lemon juice
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Dillweed

MMMMM-------------------BASIC POACHING LIQUID------------------------
      1 md Onion (sliced)
      6    Whole black peppers
      2    Whole allspice
      3 tb Lemon juice or white wine
           Vinegar
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Dry white wine (or water)
      1 qt Water
 
   About 3-4 hours before you intend to serve, poach trout in basic
  poaching liquid (recipe and directions follow). When done, transfer
  to a serving platter and let cool; then cover and chill.
   About 10 minutes before serving time, remove cover from fish and,
  holding fish in place with wide spatula, drain off and discard any
  juices that might have collected on platter. Wipe platter and garnish
  with parsley sprigs and lemon wedges.
   In a bowl, combine sour cream, lemon juice, salt and dill weed. Mix
  thoroughly. Serve sauce in small serving bowl to spoon over fish.
  Basic Poaching Liquid In a poaching pan or 3-quart pan, combine
  onion, whole black peppers, whole allspice, lemon juice or white wine
  vinegar, bay leaf, salt, dry white wine (or water), (you will need
  just enough to cover fish pieces, so amount of water and wine may be
  varied accordingly). Cover and simmer ingredients for at least 20
  minutes.
   Recipe may be doubled or tripled if larger amounts are needed (if so,
  simmer ingredients for 30 minutes to 1 hour). Poaching liquid may be
  reused several times - it will simply acquire more flavor, the more
  often it is used.  However, liquid should not be stored in the
  refrigerator longer than 2 days; freeze in an airtight container if
  longer storage is necessary. How to Poach Bring poaching liquid to a
  boil in poaching pan on top of the stove. Lower fish into simmering
  liquid - there should be just enough liquid to cover fish; if not,
  add equal parts water and dry white wine (or all water) just to cover
  fish. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently (water should never be
  allowed to boil).
   Cook until fish flakes readily when prodded in thickest portion with
  a fork - for a 1-inch thick piece of fish (measured in thickest
  portion), allow 10 minutes from the moment simmering resumes after
  fish has been added.  (Allow same ratio of thickness to time - 1
  inch: 10 minutes - for fishes of all thicknesses.) When, done, lift
  fish from liquid with a wide spatula, supporting it with cheesecloth
  if necessary. Drain well; then open cheesecloth carefully and gently
  remove it from fish.

  4cm long. I made some with hot mex chillies and left the seeds
  in---WOW -- Doug likes it like that. I also halfed the sugar as he
  thought it was too sweet. Also I put Chillie onion and apple through
  food processor one ingredient at a time, it makes cooking faster and
  you get a wetter end product. About 20 min. cooking.

      Title: CHIMICANGAS
 Categories: Hamburger, Mexican, Beef
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground beef
      1 md Sized chopped onion
    1/2 c  Enchilada sauce (canned is
           -fine)
 
  first, make the meat filling Brown the meat and drain. Add the onion,
  cook until soft.  Add the
  
  sauce and let simmer for 10 minutes Now you're ready to really start.
  12 flour tortillas(7 inches in diameter) 2 1/4 cups of meat
  filling(from above) 1 1/2 to 2 cups each of shredded cheddar cheese,
  shredded lettuce, and chopped green onions or radishes Sour cream
  
  Spoon 3 tablespoons of the filling down the center of tortilla.
  
  Fold tortilla around filling, and fasten with wooden toothpicks.
  Assemble only 2 or 3 at a time, or the tortilla will absorb liquid
  from the filling. Fry in 1 inch of hot oul over medium heat
  (350degrees), turning,
  
  until golden; takes 1 to 2 minutes.  Lift from fat with a slotted
  spoon, draining, then place on a thick layer of paper towels; keep in
  a warm place until all are cooked. Serve garnished with 2 or 3
  tablespoons each shredded cheese, lettuce,
  
  and radishes or green onions, and add sour cream to taste. Do not
  forget to remove the toothpicks before serving. I've done
  
  it once, and it is extremely painful. These aren't quite like the
  ones you get in restaurants, because
  
  they use huge platter-sized tortillas.  They are still a grease
  maniac's dream--very greasy, very tasty.  You can use animal fat or
  lard to fry up the chimichangas, I believe, but I would suggest using
  vegetable oil. It works just fine, and the other way will probably
  cause a cholesterol overload.  Otherwise, it's fantastic.

 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/4 lb Lean boneless pork *
      6 oz Pork fat
      2    Pieces scallion
           -(6" long)
      3    Slices ginger
    1/4 ts 5 spice powder
      2 tb Sugar
      3 tb Soysauce
      1 tb Wine (Kao-Liang)
    1/2 tb Sesame oil
    1/4 ts Black pepper
 
   *(butt or loin)
  
   Procedure:
  
   1. Trim the meat into a round piede-1 1/2 inch diameter. Cut the
  first slice almost through.  Cut the secon slice completely through.
  Continue until you have 20 double pieces. (The shape should be like a
  hamburger bun, that is one piece should not be cut completely
  through). Cut the pork fat into 20 round pieces a little smaller than
  the lean pork.
  
   2. Place pork and fat into a bowl.  Add the crushed scallion and
  ginger, five spice powder, sugar, soysauce, wine, sesame oil, and
  pepper. Stir until the ingredients are well mixed. Soak about one
  hour.
  
   3. Put one slice of fat into each double slice of the lean pork. Put
  the pieces on a skewer.  Don't put them too close together. Put the
  skewer on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Roast the coin shape
  pork for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F. (after cooking for 15 minutes
  remove and rub some of the marinade sauce on the pork and then return
  to the oven). Remove the pork from oven and remove from the skewer.
  Rub some oil on top.
   Arrange on a platter in overlapping layers.
  
   NOTE:  1.  Serve with Steamed Flower Shaped Rolls, which are in
  Pei-Mei's Cook Book Volume I page 233. 2.
   The skewer should be as long as a chopstick.

     Toast the whole spices together in a small dry skillet over low
  heat, stirring and adjusting the heat so that the spices toast
  without burning. Stir until the spices are fully fragrant and the
  fennel seeds and lighter colored spices are lightly browned, about 5
  minutes. Stir in the ground spices.
     Using a spice grinder or a clean coffee grinder, grind the mixture
  finely.  Store in a tightly covered jar.
     Serving suggestions:  Use in marinades and sauces, mayonnaises,
  chopped meat mixtures, sauteed vegetables and pastas.

      Title: CHINESE BBQ PORK
 Categories: Pork, Chinese
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Boneless pork shoulder, cut
           -into 8"x2-1/2"x1/2" pieces

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      5 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 ts Ginger juice
      4 tb Ketchup
      4 tb Soy sauce
      5 ts White wine
      1 ts Five spice powder

MMMMM-----------------------BASTING SAUCE----------------------------
      1 tb Hoisin sauce
    1/4 c  Honey
 
  Marinate pork for 2-4 hours, or overnight if you wish. Preheat oven
  to 375F and place marinated pork on a rack over a roasting pan filled
  with 1 cup of water. Bake for 20 minutes, basting occasionally with
  remaining marinade. Turn and bake another 20 minutes.
  
  Take pan out of oven, swich oven to broil.  Baste both sides of pork
  with basting sauce and broil for 1 minute on each side.
  
  Let pork cool and cut into thin slices.  Serve hot or cold. Keep in
  tightly sealed container in refrigerator or in freezer if not served
  right away. Reheat with a little water in roasting pan, or wrap in
  foil.
  
  Notes:  Let the meat marinade at least 8 hours - you will get a much
  more tender result.  Make extra, it's really good... We serve it cold
  on a plate with pickled ginger and green onion flowers as a starter
  to a Chinese meal. Or add it to 'La Choy' frozen wonton soup along
  with some green onion, and slivered vegetables for a 'homemade' look.

      Title: CHINESE BEEF STEW
 Categories: Chinese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Brisket of beef or stew beef
      4 tb Peanut oil

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 ml Fermented red bean cake *
      3 tb Hoisin sauce
      4 tb Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
      4 tb Thin soy sauce
      1 tb Minced garlic
      1    Whole star anise
      1 ts Roasted and crushed
           -Szechwan peppercorns
      1 ts Five spice powder
      2 ts Sugar
      6 c  Water
      1 lg (about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
           -Chinese (icicle) radish,
           -roll cut.
 
  Tough beef is most flavorful, but you must simmer it gently for
  several hours to soften the sinewy muscle. Slow braising also
  encourages an exchange of flavors between the meat and the tangy
  sauce, enhancing both. Chinese radish adds just the right bite, much
  as turnips would in a Western stew.  In effect, this is Chinese beef
  stew.
  
  Game meats or goat meat may be substituted for the beef for a
  delicious and unusual variation.  Oxtails can also be braised in this
  manner, or even veal shanks. Almost any cut of meat or organ that
  requires extensive cooking does well if braised.  The strong sauce
  keeps the meat flavorful throughout.
  
  Turnips or carrots may be substituted for the Chinese radish, and
  chestnuts have a strong, sweet taste that holds up well to braising.
  [Make a diagonal slice, roll daikon 1/4 turn and slice again.
  Continue rolling and cutting until done. S.C.]
  
  * [This is nice if you have some laying around, but don't worry if you
  don't.  The taste can be somewhat bizarre for a Westerner, but it
  won't overwhelm the dish S.C.]
  
  1.  The preferred cut is brisket of beef, a boneless piece of tough
  meat from the underside of the steer, because of its rich, gelatinous
  texture when cooked. It is sold in Chinese meat markets as Chinese
  stew beef. Any tough beef cut can be used, such as boneless chuck and
  bottom round.
  
  2.  Trim away the outer layers of fat.
  
  3.  Cut the meat into 1 1/2 inch strips.
  
  4.  Cut the strips into cubes.
  
  5.  Brown the meat on all sides in a wok over a high flame in 3
  tablespoons of the oil.  Set it aside.
  
  6.  In the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil, over a high flame, break up
  the red bean curd with a spatula.
  
  7.  Add the remaining sauce ingredients.  Bring them to a boil.
  
  8.  Add the beef to the sauce, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the
  wok, and braise the beef for 2 hours. After 1 1/2 hours, add the
  roll-cut radish. Cook for 30 minutes more, until both the beef and
  radish are tender.
  
  9.  Serve the stew immediately.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      1 lb Chicken breast halves
           Without skin -- boneless

           Taste
 
  Saute vegetables in butter until almost soft.  Cut chicken into bite
  size chucks.  Season chicken with five spice powder sparingly. Add
  chicken and mushrooms. Stir fry on high heat very fast, until chicken
  is done. Turn down heat. Then add apple cider, soy sauce and
  pineapple juice. Can add more soy sauce and pineapple if needed. Add
  sugar. Mix cornstarch and water together and add and turn on very
  high heat until thickens. Can add just a very little pinch of five
  spice to mixture, but be careful with five spice. It's very strong.
  To make lower fat, can saute vegetables with 1/2 margarine and 1/2
  chicken broth. Can make lower in Sodium if use low sodium soy sauce.
  When seasoning chicken breasts, use five spice sparingly. Toss with
  noodles.

 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Accent*
      2 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Vinegar
    1/3 c  Salad oil
      1 bn Bok Choy
      1 bn Napa cabbage
      1 pk Ramen noodles
      1    Chicken breast (optional)
      4    Green onions
  1 1/2 c  Unsalted peanuts (up to 2 c)
 
  Mix dressing ingredients (sugar, Accent, oils, pepper and vinegar)
  and let stand.  Boil and shred chicken breast. Slice bok choy and
  cabbage and dice green onions. Break noodles into small pieces.
  Combine bok choy, cabbage, chicken, noodles, onions and peanuts. Pour
  dressing over combined ingredients and toss to coat.
  
  * Instead of Accent, you can use 1/2 t. each of garlic and celery
  salt and 1 t. seasoned salt.
  
  Note: if served immediately, noodles are very crispy. I prefer to let
  it sit in refrigerator for a while to "mellow."
  
  This makes a good sized bowl of salad; not sure of the exact
  servings, but at least 4-6 people.

  2 1/2 lb Plain roasted chicken
      8 oz Fresh bean sprouts
      2 md Cucumbers
      1    Carrots (or double amount)

MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
      3 tb Sesame paste, or peanut
           - butter
      2 tb Finely chopped scallions
      2 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Chinese white rice vinegar
           -or cider vinegar
      3 tb Light soy sauce
  1 1/2 tb Finely chopped garlic
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
      1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
 
  TRIM THE BEAN SPROUTS at both ends. Peel the cucumber, split it in
  half lengthwise and remove the seeds with a teaspoon. Finely shred
  the cucumber into 3-inch lengths. Peel and finely shred the carrots
  into 3-inch lengths. Set the vegetables aside. Take all the meat off
  the cooked chicken and shred it into fine strips using a sharp knife
  or cleaver. Arrange the chicken strips on a platter and surround them
  with the bean sprouts, cucumbers and carrots. Combine all the
  ingredients for the dressing and mix them thoroughly. (I find an
  electric blender is useful for this, but you could use a screw-top
  jar and shake everything in it well.) Pour the dressing all over the
  chicken and vegetables and mix well. Serve at once.

      Title: CHINESE CHILI WITH PEPPERS
 Categories: Chinese, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Ground lamb
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Hoisin sauce
      1    Green bell pepper
      1    Red bell pepper
      1    Yellow bell pepper
      1 sm Yellow on1on
      2 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
      4    Cloves garlic, finely minced

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 tb Dry sherry
      2 tb Hoisin sauce
      2 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Bean sauce
      1 tb Oriental sesame oil
      1 tb Distilled white vinegar
  1 1/2 ts Chinese chili sauce
 
  Stir-fried ground meat and diced vegetables in a spicy sauce produce
  an Oriental "chili" that can be mounded on steamed rice or buttered
  noodles to make a quick and satisfying dinner.
  
  ADVANCE PREPARATION:
  
  In a bowl, thoroughly combine lamb, soy sauce, sherry, and hoisin
  sauce. Set aside until ready to cook.
  
  Seed and stem peppers, then cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Peel and
  coarsely chop onion.  Set peppers and onion aside.
  
  In a small bowl, combine sauce ingredients; set aside.
  
  LAST-MINUTE COOKING:
  
  Stir cornstarch with an equal amount of cold water, then set aside.
  Place wok over highest heat.  When wok becomes very hot, add 1
  tablespoon peanut oil to center, then roll oil around sides of wok.
  When oil just begins to smoke, add lamb and stir-fry, pressing meat
  against the sides of the wok, until it loses its raw color and
  separates into small pieces, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to a work
  platter.
  
  Immediately return wok to highest heat and add remaining tablespoon
  peanut oil to center.  Add ginger and garlic and saute for a few
  seconds. Add vegetables and stir-fry until peppers brighten and onion
  becomes transparent, about 2 minutes.
  
  Return lamb to wok and pour in sauce.  Bring sauce to a low boil,
  then stir in a little cornstarch mixture to lightly thicken. Reduce
  heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes. Turn out onto a heated platter
  or individual plates. Serve at once with steamed rice, noodles, or
  bread.
  
  Serves:  2 as an entree; 6 to 8 as part of an Oriental meal.
  
  MENU IDEAS:  Easy dinner for 4 - Chinese Chili with Peppers (double
  recipe); Onion Bread (double recipe; cook before guests arrive, and
  reheat in oven); Steamed Corn with Chinese Herb Sauce; ice cream and
  coffee.
  
  Notes:  This dish is excellent made with ground pork, beef, or lamb,
  but not with ground veal, chicken, or turkey.
  
  To simplify any stir-fry dish, substitute 3/4 pound ground meat (pork,
  beef, or lamb) for the cubed or sliced meat or seafood. This shortens
  the preparation time but results in an equally good dish.

      Title: CHINESE CRAB RICE
 Categories: Chinese, Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2    Green onions, chopped
      1    Piece fresh ginger, 2-3 cm,
           -grated
      4 tb Dry sherry
      3 tb Light soy sauce
      3    Blue crabs
    400 g  Glutinous rice
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Oil
      1 ts Sugar
 
  The Chinese have comfort food, too, and this dish qualifies. You will
  need a large steamer; if you don't yet have one, they can be bought
  cheaply in large Chinese or Vietnamese food stores where you can also
  pick up the glutinous rice. The dish takes considerably longer to
  cook than the previous recipes but little more of the cook's time. By
  the time the rice is cooked, it is saturated with crab flavour.
  
  Finely chop 2 green (spring) onions and grate 2-3 cms of fresh ginger.
  Combine them with 4 tablespoons dry sherry and 3 tablespoons light soy
  sauce. Prepare three green blue swimmers crabs. Chop two of them into
  several pieces with a large knife or cleaver and crack the hardest
  pieces of the shell with a hammer. Crack the third crab thoroughly
  all over but do not chop up. Pour the sherry-soy sauce mixture over
  the crabs and leave to marinate for an hour. Wash 400 grams glutinous
  rice in several changes of water until the water runs clear.
  
  Put the rice into a saucepan and pour over it 1.5 L water. Bring to
  the boil and boil for 5 minutes. Drain.
  
  In the bottom of a heatproof dish at least 12 cm deep and of a size
  to fit into your steamer, pack in the chopped crab pieces, reserving
  the marinade. Pour the rice over the top and pack it down. Press the
  intact crab into the top of the rice. To the marinade, add a further
  tablespoon soy sauce and a tablespoon oil, teaspoon salt and 1
  teaspoon sugar. Pour over the crabs and rice.
  
  Put the dish in the steamer over boiling water and steam for 35-40
  minutes. Serve. Diners deal first with the top crab, now half buried
  in rice, then fish around, for the rest of the crab pieces in rice.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 c  Chicken Broth
      1    Egg (Room Temperature)
 
  Heat the broth in a saucepan until it boils vigorously. Reduce the
  heat to a slow simmer (bubbles form and collapse BELOW the surface of
  the liquid). Break the egg into a cup and beat very lightly (just
  enough to combine yolk and white). Hold the cup in one hand, about 5
  inches above the soup, while gently swirling the fork in WIDE circles
  in the soup with the other. Slowly pour a thin stream of egg into the
  soup, catching the egg with the fork (in the soup) and drawing it
  into wide circles in the soup. Interrupt the pouring several times so
  as to form several long, filmy threads. Season to taste. Add a
  generous squeeze of lemon. Serve immediately. Posted By

    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Corn oil
      2 tb Water
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
 
  Have fortunes prepared in advance. Beat egg on low speed until
  frothy. Beat in sugar, a little at a time, & continue beating until
  mixture is a very light yellow and thick. Fold in corn oil. Blend
  water and a little of the egg mixture into cornstarch, then stir into
  the remaining egg mix.Heat heavy, well seasoned griddle to 350 deg,
  or until drops of water bounce when dropped on the griddle. (For
  griddles without temperature control, keep heat between low and
  medium). Drop heaping T of batter on the griddle and spread with the
  back of a spoon to about 4 in. wide and 1/8 in. thick. Cook until
  edges are slightly brown & cookies can be easily lifted from griddle
  with a spatula, 5 - 8 min. (If cookies stick, bottoms need to be
  cooked a little longer). Turn cookies carefully & cook other side
  until light brown. Be careful to keep temperature even. Place fortune
  paper on cookie as soon as it is removed from the griddle. Folding is
  easier to do than to describe, but the end result is shaped like a
  horseshoe. Fold opposite edges together, forming a semicircle. Crease
  crosswise at the center of the straight edge to form a flattened
  side, then bend the opposing corners together for the traditional
  shape. Set in a small glass or muffin tin until cookie cools and
  holds its shape.Wipe griddle & stir batter. Repeat.

 Categories: Desserts, Cathe
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      4 c  Pecan halves
      6 c  Water, boiling (or more)
      1 c  Sugar
      2 c  Oil
 
  NOTE:  This dish must be started a full 24 hours before you plan to
  serve it.
  
  Put pecans in a large pot or heat-proof bowl.  Cover with boiling
  water and let them soak 3 minutes.  Drain the pecans and spread them
  in a single layer on a large platter or non-rusting cookie sheet.
  Cover with sugar and stir until pecans are completely coated with the
  sugar. (The sugar will dissolve slightly.)  You might have to add
  water if the nuts are too dry for the sugar to stick.
  
  Transfer the sugared nuts to a dry platter and set them aside to
  air-dry overnight.  They really need to dry for 24 hours.
  
  When ready to serve the pecans, bring the oil almost to the smoking
  point in a wok or large pot.  Fry one quarter of them at a time,
  being careful not to let them burn. The sugar will melt. Carefully
  remove the cooked nuts from the hot oil with a strainer and put them
  on a heatproof glass platter. Fry each quarter of the nuts
  individually so all of them will get hot enough for the sugar to
  melt. Serve immediately.

      Title: CHINESE HONEY GOOSE
 Categories: Poultry, Foreign, Personal
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Whole goose

MMMMM--------------------HONEY SYRUP MIXTURE-------------------------
      1    Lemon
      4 c  Water
      3 tb Honey
      3 tb Dark soy sauce
    2/3 c  Rice wine or dry sherry
 
  IF THE GOOSE IS FROZEN, thaw it thoroughly. Rinse the goose well and
  blot it completely dry with paper towels. Insert a meat hook near the
  neck. Using a sharp knife, cut the lemon into 1/4-inch slices,
  leaving the rind on. Combine the lemon slices with the rest of the
  honey syrup ingredients in a large pot and bring the mixture to a
  boil. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes. Using a
  large ladle or spoon, pour this mixture over the goose several times,
  as if to bathe it, until all of the skin is completely coated with
  the mixture. Hang the goose in a cool, well-ventilated place to dry
  for 4-or-5 hours, or hang it in front of a cold fan for about 3
  hours--in either case, the longer the better. Once the goose has
  dried, the surface of the skin will feel like parchment. Preheat the
  oven to 475F. Meanwhile, place the goose on a rack in a roasting pan,
  breast side up. Put 2/3 cup of water into the roasting pan. Now put
  the goose into the oven and roast it for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to
  350F and continue to roast for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Remove the
  goose from the oven and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before you
  carve it. Using a cleaver or sharp knife, cut the skin and meat into
  pieces and arrange them on a warm platter.

      Title: CHINESE MARINATED MEAT
 Categories: Meats, Condiments
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Dry sherry (cooking
           -sherry will do)
      2 tb Light soy sauce
    1/4 c  Dark soy sauce
  2 1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Hoisin sauce
      1 ts Curry powder
    1/4 c  Pineapple juice,
           -unsweetened (or use
           -the juice from the
           -can of pineapple chunks)
    1/2 ts White pepper
      2 tb Ginger root, cut into
           -thin (1/8-inch) slices

MMMMM------------------------MEAT SKEWERS-----------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Sirloin tip
     12 oz Pineapple chunks
 
  Combine the ingredients for the marinade; stir well.
  
  Cut meat into bite-size chunks and place on skewers with 2 or 3
  chunks of pineapple in between the meat pieces. Marinate the skewers
  overnight, in a covered container, in the refrigerator.
  
  To cook, broil the meat for about 10 minutes (depends on the size of
  the chunks).  When the weather permits, grilling it outdoors on
  skewers is even better.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Broiled beef in a Chinese marinade -- After frequenting a local
  Chinese restaurant, I finally asked for the recipe for the marinade
  for the meat that came on skewers on the pu pu platter. I was given a
  list of ingredients with instructions like "heavy on this, light on
  this". I devised my own amounts from this list. I served it to my
  family and they enjoyed it, so I feel confident sending it to
  mod.recipes.
  
  *  You may need to double the marinade recipe.  I use a Tupperware
  container made especially for marinating. Any container will do, but
  it's tough having to turn over all those skewers.
  
  *  The hoisin sauce, ginger root and light soy sauce should be
  available in any good grocery store. Comments, revisions and/or
  additions will be appreciated.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 12 hours marinating, 10 minutes
  cooking. : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHINESE MINIMAL FISH SOUP
 Categories: Chinese, Fish, Lowfat, Seafood, Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 c  Spring water
      3    Slices ginger
      3    Whole star anise

           -slices
           Salt
      6    Cilantro sprigs (fresh)
 
  Call your seafood shop ahead of time and ask for the fish to be sliced
  paper-thin.  If you have a problem finding someone to do this, the
  fish may be sliced by hand. Partially freeze the fish so it is firm,
  yet not frozen solid, and slice with a very sharp knife.
  
  Bring water to boil in saucepan.  Add ginger and star anise and
  simmer 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let steep about 7 to 10
  minutes, no longer, then strain.
  
  Put sliced bok choy in bottom of large serving bowl. Add sliced green
  onions and iceberg lettuce.  Arrange fish slices in single layer to
  cover.
  
  Return broth to boiling.  Season to taste with salt. Present bowl
  without broth at table, then pour boiling seasoned water over fish.
  Ladle soup into serving bowls. Top each bowl with 1 cilantro sprig.

  :          jullienne
  :          Cilantro leaves -- for
  :          garnish
  
  Begin by making the marinade. Combine all the ingredients (except the
  noodles) in a bowl, stir them together until the sugar is dissolved.
  Next, bring a large pot of water to a boil for the noodles. While it
  is heating, gentl y pull apart the strands of no odles with your
  fingers, loosening and fluffing them as you do so. Add the noodles to
  the boiling water without any salt, and give them a quick stir w ith
  a fork or a pair of chopsticks. Cook briefly until they are done but
  no t overly soft, a few minutes a t most. Immediately pour them into
  a colander and rinse them in cold water to stop the cooking. Shake
  the colander vigorously to get rid of as much wa ter as possible, and
  put the noodles into a bowl. Stir the marinade again; then pour half
  of it over the noodles and toss the m with your hands to distribute
  the marinade. Set the remaining marinade as ide. If the noodles
  aren't to be used for a while, cover them with plastic and
  refrigerate them. The flav ors, as well as the heat in the red pepper
  oil, will develop as the noodles sit. Preheat the oven to 400=B0F.
  Pierce the eggplants in several places and bak e them until they are
  soft and their skins have shriveled, about 20 minutes , depending on
  their size. Turn them over after 10 minutes so they will bak e
  evenly. When the eggplants are done, remove them to a cutting board
  and slice them in half lengthwise. Wh en they are cool enough to
  handle, peel the skin away from the flesh. Don't worry about any
  small pieces of skin that are difficult to remove - the fl ecks of
  dark purple - brown ar e pretty. Shred the eggplants, gently tearing
  them into 1/4 - inch strips.  Add the ginger and garlic to the
  reserved marinade, then the eggplant strip s. Turn the pieces over
  several times to make sure all the surfaces are wel l coated, and set
  them aside. Bring a quart of water to a boil with a teaspoon of salt.
  Blanch the snow p eas until they are bright green; then remove them
  with a strainer and rinse them in cool water. Cut them into long,
  narrow strips and set them aside. Next, put the sprouts in the w ater
  and cook them for about 30 seconds. Pour them into a colander, rinse
  t hem with cold water, and lay them on a clean kitchen towel to dry.
  Roast the sesame seeds in a pan until they are lightly colored and
  smell to asty. If the noodles have been refrigerated, allow them to
  come to room temperatu re; then toss them with the eggplant strips
  and half the sesame seeds. Moun d them on a platter, distribute the
  carrots, snow peas, and mung bean sprou ts over the noodles, and
  garni sh with the remaining sesame seeds and the leafy branches of
  cilantro. Pres ent the salad like this, layered and laced with the
  colorful garnishes, eit her on a single large platter or on
  individual plates. Once served, guests can toss the noodles and veget
  ables together to thoroughly mingle the different colors, textures,
  and tas tes. This salad is a combination of recipes that were
  suggested to us by the Chi na scholar and cook, Barbara Tropp, author
  of The Modern Art of Chinese Coo king. She thought they would be
  particularly well suited to our vegetarian menu, and they are.
  
  Variations: Instead of sesame seeds, use roasted peanuts or cashew
  nuts. Bl= ack sesame seeds can also be mixed with the white. In
  spring, blanched aspa= ragus tips can be used in place of the
  eggplants, and long red or white rad= ishes, thinly sliced, then sli
  vered, can be included among the garnishes.
  
  Serves 4 to six.

      Title: CHINESE PANCAKES
 Categories: Chinese, Breakfast
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Very hot water (or more)
      2 tb Sesame oil
 
  PUT THE FLOUR into a large bowl. Stir the hot water gradually into the
  flour, mixing all the while with chopsticks or a fork until the water
  is fully incorporated. Add more water if the mixture seems dry.
  Remove the mixture from the bowl and knead it with your hands until
  smooth. This should take about 8 minutes. Put the dough back into the
  bowl, cover it with a clean, damp towel and let it rest for about 30
  seconds. After the resting period, take the dough out of the bowl and
  knead it again for about 5 minutes, dusting with a little flour if it
  is sticky. Once the dough is smooth, form it into a roll about 18
  inches long and 1 inch in diameter. Take a knife and cut the roll
  into equal segments. There should be about 18. Roll each segment into
  a ball. Take two of the dough balls, dip one side of one ball into
  the sesame oil and place the oiled side on top of the other ball.
  Take a rolling pin, and roll the two together into a circle about 6
  inches in diameter. It is important to roll double pancakes in this
  way because the resulting dough will remain moist inside and you will
  be able to roll them thinner but avoid the risk of overcooking them
  later. Heat a skillet or wok over a very low heat. Put the double
  pancake into the wok or pan and cook it until it has dried on one
  side. Flip it over and cook the other side. Remove from the pan, peel
  the pancakes apart and set them aside. Repeat this process until all
  the dough balls have been cooked. Steam the pancakes to reheat them,
  or you can wrap them tightly in a double sheet of foil and put them
  into a pan containing 1 inch of boiling water.

      2 tb Catsup
      2 ts Sesame oil to brush on top
           -of pizza
 
  This is from one of Martin Yan's books...  I haven't tried this, but
  it looks pretty tasty.  In general, I don't care for Yan's recipes,
  although I do get a kick out of his show. I don't know what it is,
  but the few things I've made from this book just don't seem to quite
  make it.
  
  1.  To make crust:  Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let set
  for 10 minutes.  Stir in oil and salt; add flour gradually. Knead
  dough for 10 to 15 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in
  greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place free from drafts
  until double in bulk (1 1/2 to 2 hours).  Punch down dough and roll
  into thin crust. Make 2 pizzas of 12" diameter, 1/4" thickness. Place
  crust on baking sheet.
  
  2.  Combine ingredients for sauce and set aside.
  
  3.Heat oil over high heat; put in garlic and ginger, stir for 5
  seconds. Add remaining ingredients, except hoisin sauce, catsup and
  sesame oil; reduce heat to medium-high. Stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes.
  Add hoisin sauce and catsup and stir-fry for another minute.
  
  4.  Spread sauce on dough, then top with stir-fried vegetables and
  meat; brush sesame oil on top.
  
  5.  Bake pizza at 375F for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve and
  enjoy.
  
  REMARKS: One cup of sausage is equal to 3 sausages. For a classier
  pizza, add 1/2 cup sliced prawns For added hotness, put 1/2 teaspoon
  hot chili oil into the sauce.

           -diced
      5    Garlic clove; minced
      1    Cinnamon stick
 
  * weight before preparation
  
  Roast the peppers to remove skin; quarter lengthwise and devein. Set
  aside.
  
  Combine the apricots, plums, three cups of vinegar and water in a
  large non-reactive kettle and simmer until soft; about 25 minutes.
  Remove from heat and set aside.
  
  In another non-reactive kettle, this one very large, combine the
  remaining vinegar, sugars, and Karo and bring to a boil, stirring.
  Add the fruit mixture, ginger, salt, mustard seeds, onion, chiles,
  garlic, cinnamon, and the skinned bell peppers.  Simmer, covered, for
  five minutes then simmer uncovered for one hour, stirring every so
  often. Remove the cinnamon stick.
  
  With a food processor, pulse the mixture for a couple of seconds
  (this has to be done in batches; process a little longer if you like
  a less- textured sauce). Return to the kettle and boil gently,
  stirring, until the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes (the sauce
  will thicken some more as it cools).
  
  Ladle into sterilized jars, either half-pint or pint. Process in a
  boiling water bath for 10 minutes (for half-pint jars) or 15 minutes
  (for pint jars).  Allow to age in the jar for 2 to 4 weeks before
  using.

  A reader who requested the recipe for a sweet and pungent shrimp from
  the Panda Inn in Pasadena won the everlasting thanks of our tasting
  panel. Because it's as impossible to eat just one of these as it is
  to eat a single kernel of popcorn, the recipe is often called Chinese
  popcorn.
       __________________________________________________

  Peel and devein the shrimp.  Slice in halves lengthwise. Rinse well
  and pat dry.  Add the egg white to the shrimp and mix well. Mix
  1-1/2tablespoons cornstarch with salt and add to shrimp. Stir to coat
  well. Add 1-1/2 tablespoons oil and mix well again. Place the shrimp
  in a bowl and refrigerate at least 2 hours.Remove the shrimp and dust
  with remaining cornstarch.  Shrimp should be dry to the touch. Heat
  the remaining oil in a large wok to 350 to 375 degrees. Fry the
  shrimp 1-1/2 to 2 minutes until crisp, being careful to separate them
  with a long- handled wooden spoon or chopsticks to prevent sticking.
  It may be necessary to fry the shrimp in several batches.  When done,
  remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain well.  Combine the
  shrimp and the sweet and pungent sauce and toss quickly to coat.
  Immediately turn out onto a platter and sprinkle with finely chopped
  green onions. SWEET AND PUNGENT SAUCE: Combine the sugar, catsup,
  vinegar, and salt, and set aside. Heat the oil in a wok. Add the
  garlic, ginger, green onion, red pepper, and zests of lemon and
  orange; cook 30 seconds.  Stir in the sugar-catsup mixture.
  Immediately add the sherry mixture and cook until slightly thickened.

      Title: CHINESE PORK-LETTUCE ROLLS
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Heads Boston lettuce
           Dried Chinese mushrooms --
      6    8 mushrooms
      8 oz Waterchestnuts -- canned
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoots
      1 lb Ground pork
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
      4 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Dry sherry
    3/4 c  Chicken broth
    1/2 ts Salt -- to taste
    1/4 c  Corn oil
      1 c  Celery -- minced
 
  1. Black mushrooms are optional. If using, soak in boiling water for
  30 minutes, drain, cut off stems, and chop. 2. Wash lettuce, dry, and
  arrange 16-20 of the largest leaves on a serving plate, then
  refrigerate. Use head lettuce if Boston lettuce is not available. 3.
  Mince the waterchestnuts and bamboo shoots; add to drained mushrooms.
  Set aside. 4. Mix together the pork, slightly beaten egg, soy sauce
  and 3 teaspoons (1 tablespoon) of the cornstarch. Set aside. 5.
  Combine sherry, 1/2 cup broth and salt. Add remaining 1 teaspoon
  cornstarch to the remaining 1/3 cup broth, blend well. 6. Heat a wok
  or heavy skillet; add oil to the hot skillet. Add pork mixture and
  cook, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. 8. Add mushroom mixture;
  cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes. 9. Stir in wine mixture and the
  cornstarch mixture. 10. Add celery and stir until celery is heated
  through. If celery is minced fine enough, it won't need any further
  cooking time. 11. Place meat on a serving dish. To serve, let each
  guest fill a lettuce leaf with pork and roll the leaf. This is to be
  eaten with the fingers.

      2 ts Sesame Oil
      4 lg Cloves Garlic; minced
      1 pk Potsticker Wrappers
      1    Egg White; lightly beaten
    1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
      2 c  Chicken Broth
           Hot Pepper Oil

MMMMM------------------SESAME-SOY DIPPING SAUCE-----------------------
    1/2 c  Soy Sauce
      2 tb Chinese Black Vinegar
      1 tb Garlic; minced
      1 ts Ginger; minced
      1 ts Sesame Oil
 
  Squeeze all the moisture from the spinach, then combine it with the
  pork, onions, cilantro, soy sauce, sherry, ginger, sesame oil and
  garlic; mix well.
  
  Lay a potsticker wrapper on a potsticker press. Spoon 2 ts filling
  into the center of the wrapper. Brush the edges of the wrapper with
  egg white. Press the two halves of the press together firmly. Gently
  remove the folded and crimped dumpling; lay the dumplings on a flat
  surface, crimped edges up, to form a flat bottom. Repeat with
  remainder of filling and wrappers.
  
  Heat 2 tb oil in a 12" heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add as
  many potstickers as you can get in the pan without crowding, and cook
  until golden brown on the bottom. Add 1/2 cup of the broth and cover
  the pan immediately (as soon as the broth comes in contact with the
  oil a major amount of splattering and sizzling occurs, so be
  careful.) Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook the dumplings until
  most of the liquid has been absorbed and the potstickers are nicely
  plumped and a deep golden brown on the bottom.
  
  Remove from heat and keep warm in a 200¯F. oven while you cook the
  remaining potstickers in the same manner. In a small container,
  combine the dipping sauce ingredients. Serve the sauces in separate
  dishes with the potstickers.

      Title: CHINESE SAUSAGE & RICE
 Categories: Loo, Chinese, Sausage, Rice
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Raw white rice
      3 c  Water
      1    Or 2  Chinese sausages
 
  The MOST typical use of sausage is (hold your hat - another strange
  locution but slightly more comprehensible) steamed on rice. Plain.
  Poor people's food (actually, a poor people's special treat) but quite
  satisfying: Bring the rice to a boil in 2 1/2 c of the water. Lower
  heat to low and cook 10 min. Meanwhile, slice sausages into thin
  diagonal strips. Add rest of water to rice and cover top of rice with
  sausage strips. Some people add scallion or ginger but I prefer the
  flavor pristine. Raise heat to the boil again and then lower to low
  again. Steam until sausage fat is transparent and rice is done, 5
  minutes or so more. Serve with soy sauce on the side.
  
  To take this dish one step up, use sticky ("glutinous" or "sweet")
  rice in the usual way (requires somewhat more water and more careful
  cooking). To take this dish to its artisanly conclusion, cook the
  sticky rice separately; let it cool; cut it into 8 portions and
  spread 4 portions flat on the center part of a lotus or other large,
  tough, nonpoisonous leaf. Take the sausage strips and cut them into
  smaller pieces, and top each portion of rice with a portion of
  sausage. Add a small amount of chopped bamboo shoot, chopped
  scallion, and chopped dried shrimp (previously soaked in sherry for
  1/2 hour) to each serving. Make a sauce from 2 T soy sauce and 1 T
  broth boiled together and thickened with 1/2 t cornstarch (mixed into
  3/4 t water). Apply two teaspoons of this sauce to the top of your
  dish. Top this mess with the other 4 portions of rice and crimp the
  edges together. Now: carefully bring the sides of the leaf up to make
  an envelope, and tie with twine. Steam for 5 minutes or so and serve.

      2    Egg whites
      2 tb Flour

    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Honey
    1/3 c  Water
      1 tb Peanut oil
 
  Quite an experience to eat - the apples is still warm and soft, the
  top is crunchy and icy.  Great after a wok dinner.
  
  Peel the apples, core and cut into wedges about 1/2 inch thick. Whip
  egg whites until frothy.  Add flour and cornstarch and beat into a
  smooth batter. Heat the oil to 375F. Dip each apple wedge into egg
  white batter, place in hot oil and try, a few at a time, until crisp
  and brown. Place in a single layer on a warm service platter. Bring
  remaining ingredients to a boil in a saucepan and cook to a hard ball
  stage syrup; 280 F on candy thermometer.  Pour over apple wedges and
  serve at once, accompanied by a large crystal bowl of water
  containing lots of ice cubes. Each person picks up an apple wedge
  with a fork or small tongs and dips it into the ice water to
  crystallize the sugar and harden the top, which forms silk-like
  threads....hence the name. Serves 6.

      1    Cucumber
      3    Eggs
    1/2 c  Green onions, chopped
      1 c  Chinese noodles (or
           -linguine) per person
      1 lb Lean pork or beef,
           -chopped into small pieces
      1 ts Ginger, crushed
      1 tb Sesame seed oil
    1/2 c  Chicken broth
      5 tb Sweet bean sauce
           -(or hoisin sauce)
      3 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
  1 1/2 ts Sugar (omit if hoisin
           -sauce was used)
    1/2 ts MSG
      1 tb Green onion, finely
           -chopped
 
  TO PREPARE THE MEAT SAUCE:  Heat about 3 T oil in wok, brown the
  ginger and green onion, then add meat and brown together.
  
  Mix together the bean (or hoisin) and soy sauces, add this mixture to
  the meat, and stir fry briefly.  Then add rice wine, sugar, MSG and
  sesame oil. Add the chicken broth and simmer for about 3 minutes,
  until the sauce becomes thick and shiny. Put mixture in a serving
  bowl and set aside.
  
  (GARNISHES)
  
  :  o  Boil bean sprouts for 1 minute, drain, and put in serving bowl.
  :  o  Warm peas and put in a serving bowl.
  :  o  Cut cucumber into very fine strips, or grate. Place in serving
  bowl. :  o  Scramble eggs, fry into very thin pancakes, and cut into
  thin strips.
  
  TO SERVE:  Cook noodles in boiling water for 3 minutes; drain. If you
  are preparing this dish ahead, rinse with cold water, drain, and add
  about 1 T sesame seed oil and mix well.
  
  Serve about 1 cup hot or cold noodles in a bowl, then add the
  garnishes and meat sauce to taste.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  The original Chinese spaghetti -- This recipe is an interesting
  variation from the usual restaurant chinese food. When I learned this
  dish, I realized that this was the origin of the Italian pasta
  dishes. It still serves as a reminder that there is a huge variety of
  Northern Chinese dishes that use wheat-based starches instead of
  rice. Yield: serves 6-8.
  
  *  This dish can be prepared a day ahead and served cold. The
  selection of vegetables in the garnish is pretty arbitrary. All kinds
  of vegetable combinations are good. The only rule is that they should
  all be cut into thin strips.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  1-2 hours (lots of preparation, little cooking).
  : Precision:  Measure the sauce ingredients.

  It's crab season here in the San Francisco bay area. Heap and heaps of
  luscious Dungeness crabs are showing up all over the place. Steamed or
  live++take your pick! I was in Oakland's Chinatown last weekend
  shopping at the Sam Yick gorcery and saw a couple of boxes of still-
  kicking Blue crabs for a buck seventy-nine a pound. Good eatin' ahead!
  
  Kill and clean the crab.  Place it, top shell down, on a heat-
  resistant plate.  Scatter the onion, ginger and wine on top of the
  crab. Put the crab and plate into a preheated steamer. steam over
  high heat for 15 minutes. Remove and cool.
  
  Disjoint and crack the crab and arrange on a platter. Dip the meat
  into the dipping sauce and eat with green onions and ginger. Use the
  tip of the leg to dig out the meat.
  
  Serves 2 as a light meal.
  
  GINGER, GREEN ONION and VINEGAR DIPPING SAUCE Scatter green onions in
  a shallow saucer.  Top with the shredded ginger. Sprinkle sugar and
  salt evenly over the ginger. Pour the vinegar over the ginger. Heat
  the oil until it's hot but not smoking, and pour it over the mixture.
  It should sizzle lightly.  If it is too hot, let it cool.
  
  Makes about 2/3 cup.

 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Envelope active dry yeast
      6 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Warm water (100 degrees F.
           -to 110 degrees F.)
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour, + more
           -for kneading
      1 c  Warm milk (100 degrees F. to
           -110 degrees F.)
      2 ts Baking powder
           Asian sesame oil or
           -vegetable oil
 
  Put yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar into a bowl. Pour in warm
  water, stir, and let mixture stand 5 minutes to dissolve. It should
  foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh package of
  yeast.
  
  Put flour and remaining sugar in a food processor fitted with the
  metal blade. Turn machine on for 2 seconds to mix ingredients.
  Combine yeast mixture with warm milk and, while the machine is
  running, pour milk down the feed tube in a steady stream. Process
  until dough forms a rough ball. If the ball is sticky, add flour, 1
  teaspoon at a time, and process a few seconds longer until dough
  pulls away from sides of bowl. Remove dough to a lightly floured
  board.
  
  Knead, dusting with flour until dough is smooth and elastic, about 2
  minutes. Form dough into a ball and put it into a large, lightly
  oiled. mixing bowl. Cover and set in a warm spot. Let rise until it
  doubles in size, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down dough and turn out on a lightly floured surface. Flatten,
  then put the baking powder in the center. Fold over edges and knead
  until baking powder is thoroughly incorporated. Invert, mixing bowl
  over the dough; let rest 10 minutes.
  
  Divide dough in half. Cover one half, and roll the other half into
  12-inch-long roll; cut into 12 pieces. Remove 1 piece and cover rest.
  Roll the piece into a flat 3 1/2 inch circle. Lightly brush one with
  oil; fold over to form a half moon. With the back of a knife score
  the half-moons crosswise at 1/4-inch intervals.
  
  Then with a chopstick, make an indentation in the middle of the
  rounded edge while the thumb and forefinger pinch the middle of
  straight edge to form a notch and form a leaf. Set on a 3-inch square
  of parchment paper and place in a steaming basket. (You will need 2
  baskets, or you'll need to steam 2 separate batches.) Repeat with
  remaining dough; leave space between buns in the basket.
  
  Let rise for 30 minutes, or until buns almost double in size, then
  steam over boiling water for 15 minutes. When done, let cool for a
  minute before serving.
  
  Makes 24 buns.

 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 md Firm tofu (carefully
           Sliced into 1/2 inch
           Cubes)
    1/4 c  Ground pork
           (or ground beef)
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      2 tb Soybean sauce
    1/2 tb Granulated sugar

  1 1/2 c  Water (or unsalted
           Chicken broth)
           (optional). mixture of
           1/2ts cornstarch and 1Tb
           Cold water
 
  step 1. heat the oil on the fry pan. 2. add in ground pork, stir fry
  them until cooked (lightly brown) 3. scoop ground pork to one edge of
  the fry pan, and add chopped garlics 4. stir fry garlic and ground
  pork few times and then add soybean sauce, sugar, and salt to taste(I
  prefer not to add too much) 5. careful slide the tofu cubes into the
  fry pan. Tofu is fragile, so after they are set into the pan, DONT
  stir fry them. if you really need to move them, PUSH them tenderly by
  the flat side of the spoon. 6. add water to boil to 10 min. (close
  the lid on and simmer, and I prefer a longer time to 20 minutes if I
  am not in a hurry) 7. now you can smell how good it is to cook with
  soybean sauce and sugar in chinese food, after the tofu cubes absorb
  the sauces and are done, spread over the mixture of cornstarch and
  cold water and heat up to boil again until the sauce becomes a little
  bit thick, 8. sprinkle the chopped green onion and ready to serve. be
  careful to PUSH or scoop the tofu to the serving plate, you dont want
  to smash the tofu cubes and let the savory sauces come out of them.:>
  THis dish goes greatly with rice.

      1 ts Sugar
           Rice, cooked

  Preparation: ============
  
     First julienne the mushrooms and vegetables into thin, short
  strips. Set aside.
  
     Cut the salmon steak in half.  Take each half and slice it most of
  the way through horizontally so the two pieces fold back on a hinge
  like a hamburger or hot dog roll.
  
     Prepare a braising glaze by mixing the "sauce" ingredients above
  in a small bowl and stir and set aside.
  
  Assembly: =========
  
     Into each of the two salmon "sandwich" pieces, add a touch of salt
  and pepper to taste and then add portions of Shitake, and Inoki
  mushroom, celery and carrot as filling for the "sandwiches."
  
     Close up the "sandwiches" and set aside.
  
  To Cook: ========
  
     In a small saute pan, heat a bit of peanut oil over high heat
  until it begins to smoke and then put the salmon sandwiches in to
  brown both sides (about 1 minute each side.)
  
     When both sides are browned, add the braising sauce to the salmon.
  Cover and braise over medium heat until the salmon is done ( 2 to 3
  minutes).
  
     Transfer the cooked salmon sandwiches to a serving plate and serve
  with cakes of sticky rice and garnish with julienne fans of Szechuan
  pickle.
  
     Top with drippings from the saute pan, and pieces of Cilantro.

      Title: CHINESE VENDOR TEA EGGS
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Water
      6    Eggs
      2 tb Black tea leaves; (4 tea bag
      2 ts 5-fragrance spice powder
      1 tb Coarse salt
 
  Recipe by: The Tea Book by Sara Perry and Judith Ann Rose
      1. In a pot, cover the eggs with cold water and bring to a boil.
         Simmer for 12 minutes. Remove from heat and reserve the water.
  
      2. Place the eggs in cold water until they can be easily handled.
         With the back of a spoon, lightly tap each shell all over
  until it
         is covered with a cobweb of cracks.
  
      3. In the same pot, bring the reserved water (which should be 3
  to 4
         cups) to a boil. Add the tea leaves, 5-fragrance spice, salt
  and
         eggs. Simmer covered for an hour. Remove the pot from the heat
  and
         continue to let the eggs soak covered for 30 minutes. Remove
  the
         eggs from the water and halve them lengthwise or quarter them.
         Their flavor is best enjoyed within 24 hours.
  
     Makes 6 to 10 eggs.
  
     NOTES:
  
     In the Orient, tea eggs are often sold by street vendors as a tasty
     snack. Their unusual appearance makes them a clever addition to any
     picnic. Dusted with a combination of toasted sesame seeds and
  coarse
     salt, they make an excellent hors d'oeuvre.

      Title: CHINESE-STYLE BARBECUED PORK
 Categories: Meats, Chinese
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Shao xing
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Ginger, fresh; grated
      1    Garlic clove; minced
  2 1/2 lb Boneless pork rib end roast
    1/3 c  Catsup
      1 tb Mustard, dry
      2 ts ;Water
 
  Combine the sherry, soy sauce, sugar, ginger and garlic, blending
  well. Place the pork roast in a dish or plastic bag, add the sauce,
  and brush over the meat or close the bag tightly and turn to coat the
  meat with the sauce.  Marinate at room temperature 2 to 3 hours or in
  the refrigerator overnight.
  
  This cut of pork is best cooked on a grill with a cover or on a spit.
  If you do not have a spit or grill with a cover, shape a loose tent
  of foil over the meat to hold in the heat and help prevent flare-ups
  while cooking.
  
  Remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and place
  on a grill 6 to 8 inches above a drip pan surrounded by hot coals or
  with the coals pushed to the back of the grill. Brush the meat with
  the sauce and grill 1 hour, basting and turning as needed to cook
  evenly and prevent flare-ups.  Test with a meat thermometer. When the
  internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. the meat is thoroughly
  cooked but still tender and juicy.  A thick roast might require 30
  minutes longer.
  
  Just before the meat is done, mix the catsup into the remaining
  marinade and brush over the meat.  Turn and glaze the meat over the
  drip pan. Remove the meat to a serving plater, cover loosely with
  foil and let stand 30 minutes.  About 10 minutes before serving, mix
  the dry mustard to a smooth thin paste with the water. Slice the pork
  roast thinly and serve the catsup sauce and mustard sauce separately,
  or swirl the mustard into the catsup sauce.
  
  "I was a young woman in Miami when I first had what my date called
  Chinese roast pork with hot and heavenly sauce. This is my
  adaptation, after I learned that the restauranteur's 'hot and
  heavenly' is American catsup and mustard."

    1/2 c  Raw peanuts
      3 c  Peanut oil
      2    Whole chicken breasts at

      1 lg Egg white
  1 1/2 tb Water chestnut flour
           SAUCE:
      4    Green onions
      2 lg Cloves garlic
      1 tb Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 tb Sesame oil

  Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and
  white part into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in
  2-quart saucepan. Reserve.
  
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones. Slice meat
  into 1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks. In bowl large
  enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour. Beat
  mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk). Stir
  chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat thoroughly. Marinate 5
  minutes. Note: water chestnut flour gives a lighter crust than
  cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted.
  
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat
  (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer). Fry peanuts until they are a
  light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.
  Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel
  or paper bag. Reserve.
  
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first: chicken should
  raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes. Deep-fry
  coated chicken chunks until golden brown. Deep-fry no more than 8
  chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces
  separate while they are frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or
  slotted spoon. Reserve.
  
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer. Add green
  onions & peanuts about a minute before serving. At the last minute,
  add chicken pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

      1 ts Baking powder
           Peanut oil for deep frying

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      1 ts Five-spice powder
    1/2 ts MSG (optional)
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Rice wine
      1 ts Soy sauce
 
  Discard wing tips.  Cut between joints.  Remove the smaller bone of
  the lower wing.  Cut skin loose around the small end and push skin
  and meat up to form drumstick.
  
  Marinate wings for 1 hour.  Add egg white.  Coat wings evenly. (Using
  egg white to coat the wings will help to seal the juice inside the
  meat. Hence the meat will be juicier.
  
  Dredge wings in cornstarch mixture.  (Using cornstarch and baking
  powder helps to make the outside layer crisp.)
  
  Deep-fry for 3 minutes.  Drain.  Let cool.
  
  Deep-fry once again right before serving.  (Deep-fry the first time
  to cook the meat and seal the juice in the meat. The second time to
  make the outside crisp. Make sure the oil is very hot before you
  deep-fry for the second time.)

  Wow, with over a dozen Chinese or Oriental cookbooks, I had a hard
  time finding this recipe! It is probably called something else (like
  spicy fried chicken) and I really do have a dozen recipes.
  :)  This one is from _Elegant_ Entertaining_Cookbook_ by Myra Sable of
  Sable and Rosenfeld, Bantam books.
  
  General Tsao was a real person, general and poet who lived in China
  155-220 AD.
  
  rn e in the frig for 1 hour.
  
  Heat the oil in a wok. Deep fry the chicken, a few pieces at a time,
  about 1 minute or until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper
  towels. Pour all but 2 TB of the oil out of the wok.
  
  To the oil in the wok, add the chili peppers, garlic and ginger,
  stir-fry 2 minutes.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the remaining soy sauce, vinegar, white wine
  and 1 tea cornstarch, mix until smooth. Stir in sugar, sesame oil and
  salt. Pour into wok, cook, stirring for 2 minutes until thickened.
  
  Return  chicken pieces to wok, mix well and serve.

      2    Green onion, finely chopped
      1 sm Egg

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONING------------------------------
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      1 tb Sesame oi
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Oyster sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch
 
  Shell, devein, wash, and drain prawns.  Dice into bits.
  
  Boil mushrooms in water for 10 minutes, rinse, squeeze dry, cut off
  and discard stems; then chop into very small pieces.
  
  Combine the pork, mushrooms, prawns, and onion.  Put mixture on
  chopping board and chop 10 to 15 strokes with cleaver. (Use a sharp
  knife if you don't have a cleaver.) Texture, when you're finished,
  should be slightly finer than hamburger.
  
  Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.
  
  To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling
  skin. Then bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much
  as possible, without closing. The top of the dumpling is left open.
  
  Cook dumplings by steaming for 30 minutes.  Use as many as you need,
  with the rest, cool, wrap, freeze. Reheat after thawing by steaming
  10 minutes.
  
  Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.
  
  *  Dumpling skins are similar to won ton skins, except that they are
  round and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by
  merely cutting off the corners to round off the skin.

 Categories: Dumplings, Chinese, Appetizers, Ethnic
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      6    Dried Chinese black
           -mushrooms
      6 oz Shrimp, shelled and deveined
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
      6 oz Ground pork butt
    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots
    1/4 c  Finely diced water
           -chestnuts, preferably fresh
      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           -sherry
  1 1/2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Chicken stock
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           -coriander leaves
 
  These dumplings make great finger food for a cocktail party. They can
  be prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before
  serving. The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture,
  a unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors. Roll
  out the wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
  Wheat Starch Wrappers (see recipe) Vegetable oil Light soy sauce, for
  dipping Chinese mustard, for dipping
  
  Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and
  pliable. Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut
  off the stems at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.
  
  Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse well
  with cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.
  
  Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-
  high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns
  white. Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce.
  Combine the cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix
  until smooth; pour into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer. Remove the
  mixture to a shallow plate and mix in the remaining green onion and
  coriander. Allow the filling to cool, then refrigerate it until
  needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
  Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of
  dough. Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch
  circle. An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a
  tortilla press or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the
  edges to seal the filling inside. Repeat with remaining dough and
  filling.
  
  Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard.
  Serve with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

      Title: CHIPOTLE CHILES
 Categories: Sides
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Ripe jalapenos
 
  Americans who love the smoky taste and fiery bite of chipotles have
  recently been hit with high prices and a scarcity of product. With
  prices for these smoked jalapenos reaching $15 a pound wholesale,
  home growers yearn to smoke their own. But the Mexicans have been
  fairly secretive about their techniques, and none of the books on
  chiles describe home smoking. After a trip to Delicos Mexico, I think
  I have solved this mystery -- but the process takes some dedication.
  First, let's look at how the Mexicans do it.
  
  They use a large pit with a rck to smoke-dry the jalepenos. The pit
  containing the source of heat is underground, with a tunnel leading
  to the rack. The pods are placed on top of the rack where drafts of
  air pull the smoke up and over the pods. The jalapenos can be whole
  pods or pods without seeds. The latter are more expensive and are
  called "capones", or castrated ones.
  
  It is possible to make chipotle in the back yard with a meat smoker or
  Weber-type barbecue with a lid. The grill should be washed to remove
  any meat particles because any odor in the barbecue will give the
  chile an undesirable flavor. Ideally, the smoker or barbecue should
  be new and dedicated only to smoking chiles.
  
  The quality of homemade chipotle will depend on the maturity and
  quality of the pods, the moisture in the pods, the temperature of the
  smoke drying the pods, and the amount of time the peppers are exposed
  to the smoke and heat. The aroma of wood smoke will flavor the
  jalapenos, so carefully choose what is burned. Branches from fruit
  trees, or other hardwoods such as hickory, oak, and pecan, work
  superbly. Pecan is used extensively in parts of Mexico and in
  southern New Mexico to flavor chipotle. Do not be afraid to
  experiment with different woods.
  
  The differenc between the fresh weight of the fruits and the finished
  product is about ten to one, so it takes ten pounds of fresh
  jalapenos to produce approximately one pound of chipotles. A pound of
  chipotles goes a long way, as a single pod is usually enough to
  flavor a dish.
  
  First, wash all the pods and discard any that have insect damage,
  bruises, or are soft. Remove the stems from the pods before placing
  the pepperrs in a single layer on the grill rack. Start two small
  fires on each side of the grill with charcoal briquets. Keep the
  fires small and never directly expose the pods to the fire so they
  won't dry unevenly or burn. The intention is to dry the pods slowly
  while flavoring them with smoke. Soak the wood in water before
  placing it on the coals so the wood wil burn slower and create more
  smoke. The barbecue vents should be opened only partially to allow a
  small amount of air to enter the barbecue, thus preventing the fires
  from burning too fast and creating too much heat.
  
  Check the pods and the fires hourly and move the pods around, always
  keeping them away from the fires. It may take up to forty-eight hours
  to dry the pods completely. The pods will be hard, light in weight,
  and brown in color when dried. If necessary, let the fires burn
  through the night. After the pods have dried, remove them from the
  grill and let them cool. To preserve their flavor, place them in a
  zip-lock bag. It is best to store them in a cool and dry location. If
  humidity is kept out of the bags, the chipotles will last for twelve
  to twenty-four months.

      Title: CHIPOTLE-ANCHO CHILI PESTO
 Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      2 ea Dried ancho chilies
           -=OR=- pasilla chilies
      1 lg Red bell pepper

      Title: CHIPOTLE-HONEY GLAZED NUTS
 Categories: Appetizers, Fruit
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
 
        2    dried chipotle chilies
      1/4 c  honey
        2 TB sugar
        2 TB salad oil
      1/4 ts salt
      1/4 ts cayenne -- or more to taste
        3 c  nuts -- assortment
  :          (or 1 kind)
  
  The kick in honey glazed nuts comes from two chilies: cayenne and
  chipotle.
  
  The nuts: hazelnuts (filberts), almonds, pine, macadamias, recans,
  pistachios, walnuts.
  
  TO ROAST: Spread shelled nuts (except macadamias) in a single layer
  on a baking pan. Bake in a 350F oven, stirring often, until golden.
  Allow 5 to 7 minutes for pine nuts; 8 to 10minutes for pecans,
  pistachios, and walnuts; about 15 minutes for almonds and hazelnuts.
  
  Macadamias need lower heat because they scorch very easily; roast
  them at 300F about 20 minutes. Watch nuts carefully since they brown
  quickly. For more toasted flavor, bake nuts to a darker color.
  
  1. Remove and discard chili stems. Whirl chilies, with seeds, in a
  blender or food processor until finely ground.
  
  2. In a bowl, mix ground chilies, honey, sugar, oil, salt, and
  cayenne. Add nuts and stir until coated with seasonings.
  
  3. Pour nuts onto oiled 10- by 15-inch pan- shake into 1 layer. Bake
  in a 300F oven, stirring often, till golden brown (under skins, if
  not blanched) and honey mixture hardens, 25to 30 minutes. If
  necessary, push nuts apart; cool in pan. Serve, or store up to 3 days.
  
  Makes 3 cups
  
  To Blanch:  Remove shells. Immerse nuts in rapidly boiling water
  until the skins shrivel and loosen, 15 to 20 seconds. Drain; set
  aside to cool. The skin should slip off easily when rubbed or pinched
  off.

      1    Jar of Dried Beef, chopped
           -Small
      2    Hard boiled eggs, chopped
      2 c  Milk

  Make a white sauce by melting the butter in a double boiler, stirring
  in the flour and adding the milk gradually. Cook, stirring constantly
  to the thickened sauce. Add pepper and check for salt. Adjust if
  necessary. We like it served over toasted English Muffins. This will
  make enough sauce for about 6-8 muffin halves, depending on how
  generous you are with the sauce.

  The soup preparations may be done up to a day in advance. The final
  cooking takes little time.
  
  MARINADE: 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons Chinese rice wine or
  dry sherry 2 teaspoons hot chili oil 1/2 teaspoon finely minced fresh
  ginger 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh coriander 1/2 teaspoon
  cornstarch 1/2 to 3/4 pound pork loin, cut crosswise against the
  grain into thin slivers 1 ounce dried tree ears(about 1/2 cup) 3
  tablespoons cornstarch 8 cups unsalted chicken stock 1 small leek,
  white part only, cut lengthwise then crosswise into paper-thin half
  moons 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons soy sauce Kosher salt Freshly ground
  black pepper unseasoned Japanese rice wine SOUP TRIMMINGS: 1 small
  leek, white part only cut as above 1 small carrot, shredded 1/2 small
  fennel, halved lengthwise and cored, then cut crosswise into
  paper-thin arcs 1 small rib celery cut crosswise and on the diagonal
  
  Combine th e marinade ingredients in abowl and stir until well
  blended. Add the pork and toss well. Seal airtight and marinate in
  the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours or over night. Bring to room
  temperature before using, and retoss to loosen the slivers. Soak the
  tree ears in 3 cups of cold water for 20 to 30 minutes. When supple,
  drain and rinse under cool running water to dislodge any grit. Tear
  into nickle size pieces, dicarding any tough or woody bits. About 20
  minutes before serving the soup, dissolve the cornstarch in 1/2 cup
  of the cold chicken stock and leave the spoon in the bowl. Over a low
  heat, bring the remaining stock to a steaming near simmer in a large
  non-aluminum pot. While the soup heats, separatly blanch theleeks and
  pork in a large saucepan of simmering water. Lower the leek pieces
  into the water ina strainer for 5 seconds to wilt, then refresh under
  cold water and set aside to drain. Adjust the heat so the water
  barley simmers, then slide in the pork and gently stir to separate
  the slivers. When the meat is 90 percent cooked, 20 to 45 seconds
  depending on the thickness, remove it and spread on a plate to cool.
  Don't worry if it is a bit under done; it will cook to completion in
  the soup. Once the soup reaches a near simmer, add the soysauce, stir
  and taste. Add enough kosher salt to bring out the flavor of the
  stock and then enough pepper to zing your lips. the amount needed
  will vary depending on the stock used. Last, add the vinegar in a
  thin stream, tasting until the flavor is pleasantly sour. You may
  need as much as 1/3 cup. When the flovors are strong and balanced,
  bring the soup to a simmer, stir the cornstarch mixture to recombine,
  then add it to the pot, stirring. Once the soup turns glossy, in 2 to
  3 minutes, turn off the heat. Portion among heated soup bowl the tree
  ears, pork ribbons, leeks, carrot, fennel and celery. Ladle the
  seasoned soup into the bowls and serve immediately Subj: Tsukemono:

           - skinned
      1 c  Slivered almonds
      1 bn Chives
      4    Garlic cloves; finely minced
      1 tb Finely minced fresh ginger

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 ts Grated lemon peel, or:
           - finely minced lemon peel
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
      6 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Salt

MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
      2 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Cooking oil
           Salt and pepper
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      4 tb Unsalted butter
 
  ADVANCE PREPARATION: Dip each chicken breast in water and then gently
  flatten with a meat pounder or rolling pin until the breast increases
  in size by about one-third. Set aside. Toast the almonds in a 325 F
  oven until light golden, then set aside. Mince the chives and set
  aside. Combine the garlic and ginger and set aside. In a small bowl
  combine the sauce ingredients and mix well. LAST-MINUTE COOKING:
  Combine the cornstarch with an equal amount of cold water. Preheat
  the oven to warm. Place a small noncorrosive skillet or saucepan over
  medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon cooking oil and then garlic and ginger.
  Saute briefly, then add the sauce. Bring to a low boil and reduce the
  heat to simmer. Sprinkle the chicken on both sides with a little salt
  and pepper. Dust with flour, shaking off any excess. Place a 12-inch
  skillet over high heat. When hot, add the butter and remaining 3
  tablespoons of oil. When the butter bubbles, pan-fry 3 or 4 chicken
  pieces at a time. Cook for about 1 minute on each side. The chicken
  is done when the meat turns color and feels firm to the touch (do not
  overcook).  Transfer the chicken to a heated platter or dinner plates
  and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining chicken. Bring
  the sauce back to a low boil and stir in a little of the cornstarch
  mixture to lightly thicken it. Spoon the sauce over the chicken.
  Sprinkle the almonds and chives on top.  Serve at once.

      Title: CHIVE & DILL BATTER BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Warm water
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Or packet active dry yeast
      2 c  (1pint) lowfat cottage
           -cheese
    1/2 c  Chopped chives (onions or
           -scallions)
      1    Heaping tbsp dill weed, or
           -seeds
      2    Eggs
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Stone ground whole wheat
           -flour
      3 c  Unbleached all purpose flour
 
  There are particular batter breads that have become very popular over
  the years and this is one of them. Its full of dill, chives, and
  lowfat cottage cheese, and contains no other fat at all. But it's so
  moist and chewy, you'd never think of eating it with butter.
  
  Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve in it the
  sugar and the yeast. While they dissolve, heat the cottage cheese in
  a large saucepan until the chill is off. When it has warmed slightly,
  add the chives, dill, eggs, salt, baking soda, and flour. Mix this
  all up and add it to the yeast mixture, making sure it is all well
  blended. The next part, the rising or proofing, takes time, but it's
  the yeast that doing all the work.  You can determine how long it
  will take by where you put the dough. If you want the yeast to work
  quickly, say in 1-1/2 hours, put your bowl somewhere warm and cozy
  (75F-85F) If you want the yeast to work slowly, say all day while
  you're at work, put the dough somewhere cool (55F-65F) or in the
  refrigerator. Make sure your dough is covered so it doesn't dry out,
  and then go away and do whatever you have to do. About an hour before
  you want to serve your bread, stir it down, and pour it into two
  small, lightly greased casserole dishes or 4-1/2x8-1/2 bread pans.
  Cover and let them rise again, this time for 3/4 to 1 hour. (If the
  dough is cold, the loaves may take a bit more time to rise.) About 15
  minutes before you bake your bread, preheat your oven to 350F. Bake
  the loaves for 30-35 minutes or until they are brown and crusty.

      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    2/3 c  Water
    1/4 c  Butter, diced
  1 1/2 ts Butter, diced
      2    Eggs, beaten
  1 1/4 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb Powdered sugar
      2 ts Coffee flavoring
      4 oz Semisweet chocolate, broken
           -in pieces
      2 tb Tia Maria
      2 tb Light corn syrup
      2 ts Superfine sugar
 
  Preheat oven to 400'F. (205'C.). Lightly grease several baking sheets.
  
  Sift flour and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon onto waxed paper. Pour water
  into a saucepan. Add 3-1/2 tablespoons butter and heat gently until
  butter melts. Do not allow water to boil before butter melts. Rapidly
  bring to a boil, remove form heat and add flour all at once. Using a
  wooden spoon, stir quickly to form a smooth mixture. Return pan to
  medium heat a few seconds and beat well until dough forms a smooth
  ball and leaves sides of pan clean.
  
  Remove from heat and cool slightly. Gradually add eggs, a little at a
  time, beating well after each addition to form a smooth shiny dough.
  Transfer dough to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4" plain tube. Pipe 24
  small balls onto greased baking sheets.
  
  Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to
  350'F. (175'C.) and continnue cooking 15-20 minutes longer or until
  well risen, crisp and sound hollow when tapped on bottoms. Make a
  slit in side of each pastry to allow steam to escape. Cool on a wire
  rack.
  
  Whip cream, powdered sugar and coffee flavoring until thick. Spoon
  into a pastry bag fitted with a small star tube. Pipe cream into
  pastry or use a teaspoon to fill pastry with cream. Arrange
  profiteroles in a pyramid-shape on a serving dish.
  
  Melt chocolate and remaining butter in a heatproof bowl set over a
  pan of gently simmering water. Stir in Tia Maria and corn syrup and
  continue stirring until sauce is smooth and coats back of a spoon.
  Spoon chocolate sauce over profiteroles and let stand a few minutes.
  Mix remaining 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon with superfine sugar and
  sprinkle over profiteroles.
  
  NOTE: Profiteroles are at their best served 2 hours after assembling
  when they have softened slightly.
