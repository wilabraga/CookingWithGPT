      2 c  Diced fresh nectarines or
           -peaches, or mixed dried
           -fruit
      1 c  Mustard powder

  Combine the fruit (fresh or dried), mustard powder, water, orange
  zest, vinegar, sugar and salt in a saucepan and simmer until
  well-thickened, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally, especially
  during the last 30 minutes of cooking. Remove from heat and stir in
  lemon juice.
  
  Let cool and spoon into jars or other containers and refrig- erate.
  The mustard will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
  
  Uses: Use as a spread, or for making mustard glazes for roast lamb and
  pork. It's also great on old-fashioned hot dogs!

 Categories: Breads, Fruits/nuts, Beverages
      Yield: 18 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
      6 tb Cold butter,
           -cut in small pieces
    1/2 c  Raisins (plumped)
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 c  Plain yogurt (8oz carton)
           Grated peel of 1/2 lemon
           Milk for brushing on scones
           Butter
 
  A little heaver than plain scones.  Make them slightly smaller than
  normal and serve without jam or cream.
  
  Preheat oven to 425F (220C).  Lightly grease a large baking sheet; set
  aside.  Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large
  bowl. Stir in sugar. With your fingers, rub in butter pieces until
  mixture is crumbly.  Mix in raisins.  With a form, stir in egg,
  yogurt and lemon peel and blend well to make a dough that BARELY
  holds together (you may need to press dough together with your
  hands).  Turn out onto a floured surface. Roll out with a floured
  rolling pin or pat dough with your hands to make a round about
  1/2-inch thick.  Cut in rounds with a 1 1/2 inch fluted or plain
  cookie cutter.  Place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet; brush
  tops lightly with milk. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until scones are
  well risen and golden.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 5
  minutes. Split and serve warm with butter. Makes about 18 scones.

MMMMM---------------------------SHAKE--------------------------------
      2 c  Fruit; frozen
      1 tb Syrup, maple
 
  Use raw almonds. Freeze strawberries, bananas, blueberries, peaches,
  or fruit of your choice. Place almonds in blender and grind to fine
  powder. Add syrup and 1 c water. Blend 1-2 minutes until smooth. With
  blender running on high, slowly add remaining water. Blend 2 minutes.
  Place strainer over large bowl. Line with cheesecloth (not 100%
  neccessary, but recommended. Otherwise strain twice with very fine
  strainer.) Pour almond milk slowly into strainer and let filter
  through. When all milk has passed through strainer, press remaining
  milk out of accumulated almond fiber. Milk will keep in fridge 4-5
  days. Leftover fiber can be used as moisturizing body scrub in the
  shower. Blend almond milk and shake ingredients in blender until
  creamy. Frozen bananas will begin to discolor after a week or so. Eat
  shakes right away, because the bananas can oxidize, changing the
  appearence and taste. Use only ripe bananas for the best shakes.

      Title: FRUIT WITH AN ADDED PUNCH
 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  More from Mark in Sydney...  We're eating preserved fruits here in the
  States now, but here are some tips for putting them up for next
  winter. These tips center around using alcohol to preserve fruits of
  various types. Like brandied peaches?  Then pay attention here... If
  you have an abundance of fresh fruit, try preserving some in alcohol
  for a very special treat, suggests Jill Chinner.
  
  Fruits suitable for bottling In alcohol are peaches, apricots, pears,
  cherries, figs, dried fruits, grapes and Kiwi fruit. First, make a
  syrup as you would for preserving. Choose from light, medium or
  heavy, depending on your sweetness of tooth.  You can use white,
  brown or raw sugar or substitute honey according to taste.
  
  Light syrup: one cup sugar to three cups water. Medium syrup: one cup
  sugar to two cups water. Heavy syrup: one cup sugar to one cup water.
  
  Dissolve sugar in water and simmer gently for five minutes; allow to
  cool.
  
  To make a liqueur syrup, use equal quantities of your choice of
  liqueur or spirits and sugar syrup (see suggested combinations below).
  
  Next, prepare your fruit, again as you would for preserving. Peaches:
  peel, stone and cut in sections.
  
  Apricots: stone and cut in halves. Grapes: wash and remove stems. Kiwi
  fruit: peel and cut lengthways. Cherries: remove stones and stems.
  Pears: peel, core and cut in quarters.
  
  To each two litres of light or medium syrup, add five grams of citric
  acid. Figs:  wash and remove stems. To each one litre of light or
  medium syrup add five grams of citric acid.
  
  Dried fruits:  Cover with cold water and stand overnight. Cook gently,
  uncovered, until plumped. Drain. Reserve liquid to make a light syrup.
  Then, place fruit in clean preserving jars. Pour over sugar/liqueur
  (or just sugar) syrup, seal and place in preserver. See preserver
  instruction book for cooking times.
  
  Suggested combinations:
  
  Peaches: with brandy, Marsala, rum or vodka. Apricots: with brandy,
  Cointreau, Grand Marnier, rum or vodka. Grapes: Green ginger wine,
  white wine or port (for black grapes only). Kiwi fruit: creme de
  menthe. Pears: creme de menthe or brandy. Figs: port or brandy.
  Cherries: kirsch or brandy. Dried fruits: brandy or rum. Or use your
  imagination to make up other combinations.

    2/3 c  Sugar (or vary based
           -on sweetness of fruit)
    1/2 c  Orange juice
      2 c  Fruit, cut into pieces
      2 ts Lemon juice

 Categories: Swedish, Soups/stews, Fruits
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Dried apricots
    3/4 c  Dried prunes
      6 c  Cold water
      1    Cinnamon stick
      2 sl Lemon; 1/4" thick
      3 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
      1 c  Sugar
      2 tb Raisins
      1 tb Dried currnats
      1    Tart cooking apple; peeled,
           -cored & cut into 1/2"slices
 
  Soak the dried apricots and prunes in 6 cups cold water for 30
  minutes. Since the dried fruit expands considerably as it absorbs the
  soaking liquid, you will need a saucepan (of stainless steel or
  enamel) with a capacity of at least 3 quarts. Add the cinammon stick,
  lemon slices, tapioca and sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat,
  cover and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden
  spoon to prevent the fruits from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
  Stir in the raisins, currants and apples slices and simmer an
  additional 5 minutes, or until the apples are tender and offer no
  resistance when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer. Pour
  the contents of the saucepan into a large serving bowl and let cool
  to room temperature. Remove the cinammon stick, cover with plastic
  wrap and refrigerate to chill. Serve the fruit soup in compote dishes
  or soup bowls as a light year-round dessert.

      Title: FRY PAN PIZZA DOUGH
 Categories: None
      Yield: 4 Bases
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
    3/4 c  Warm water
      1 tb Oil
      1 tb Sugar
        ds Salt
      1    Packet of dry active yeast
           Flour
 
  Here goes; this recipe will make about 4 or 5 10 inch pizzas, or you
  can use the extra dough for bread sticks.
  
  Put aobut 1 1/2 cups of flour in a dish and add the oil, sugar and
  salt. Mix these together, then add the yeast and water. Keep adding
  flour until the dough is stiff enough to knead, the dump it out on a
  floured surface and begin to work in more flour. When the dough is
  very stiff and rubbery, oil the surface and place it in a covered
  container in a 140 degree oven for 1 hour, or until roughtly doubled.
  When the dough has risen, remove it and pound it down, then seperate
  the dough for the pizza and bread sticks. Put the pizza dough back in
  to rise and make breadsticks with the rest, and put those in to rise
  as well. Let the dough rise for aobut 45 min. more, then remove the
  pizza dough and roll it out and place it in the pan (1/8 to 1/4 inch
  thick, up to you). An oiled cast iron frying pan is what I use, and
  it works quite well. Turn the oven up to 375 degrees and let the
  pizza dough rise while the oven warms up (leave the bread sticks in
  there). While in the final rize, add sauce, cheese and toppings. Bake
  for 20-25 minutes, and take out when the cheese is browned. The bread
  sticks should be done at the same time.  Slide the pizza out of the
  pan and then cut it.
  
  Traditional tomato sauce: Pureed tomatoes (canned or fresh, best with
  fresh, skinned and seeded) Onion powder Garlic powder (McCormick's is
  best) Oregano, etc. (favorite Italian seasonings)
  
  Puree the tomatoes and let them stand for a few minutes, then drain
  off the juice.  Take the pulp and spread a thin layer on the pizza
  dough (a bit of mozzerela underneath will make it stick better).
  Leave about 3/4 inch of space around the edge.  Sprinkle the
  seasonings over the sauce, and on the crust sticking out at the edge.
  Add favorite toppings and cheeses, making sure that no cheese touches
  the edge! Any cheese touching iron will cause the pizza to stick.
  
  White pizza:  an interesting, tomatoeless pizza.  Very good!
  
  Instead of using tomato sauce, use ricotta cheese. Add a bit of water
  to make it smooth enough to spread easily. Spread normally, and then
  sprikle on the usual seasonings, toppings and cheese. Bakes in the
  same amount of time.

      Title: FUDGE <HOW TO MAKE GOOD FUDGE>
 Categories: Info/tips, Desserts, Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           General Instructions Follow
 
    Do not stir fudge once the boiling starts, unless the recipe
  specifically requires it; unnecessary stirring may cause graining.
    Beating fudge is very important. While fudge is cooling, it is
  necessary to make the fudge creamy and smooth. Beating must be
  started while fudge is comfortably warm and continued until it is
  almost firm. For fudges that require cooling and beating, beat hot
  fudge in pan or pour the hot fudge on a marble slab or formica; cool
  to lukewarm, then paddle with spatula, until of the right consistency
  to spread.
    Marshmallow creme may be mixed into many of the following fudge
  recipes just before the fudge sets up to make a softer, lighter
  fudge. If fudge is overcooked, marshmallow creme will help it from
  becoming hard and dry.

      Title: FUDGE A LA LOUISE
 Categories: Candies, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Sugar
      3    Squares dark baking
           -chocolate
  1 1/3 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter, plus extra for
           -greasing platters
      1 c  Chopped nuts
  1 1/3 ts Vanilla
 
  In a heavy saucepan mix together the sugar, chocolate, and milk.
  Place the pan over high heat and stir constantly until the choclate
  is melted and the sugar is dissolved. Bring to a full boil, and lower
  the heat so the candy continues to boil gently, not vigorously. Stir
  no more. Put a candy thermometer into the center of the mixture and
  cook until the temperature reaches exactly 232 F. Meanwhile, butter a
  large platter (turkey size) and a flat pan about 11 by 13 inches.
  When the fudge reaches 232 F., pour it into the readied platter - do
  not scrape the pan, but let it drip out. Dot with 2 tablespoons
  butter and let the mixture cool until the platter feels cool
  underneath. Add vanilla. Take a large slotted spoon and start to stir
  the liquidy mixture - it will take about 15 or 20 minutes. You will
  see a steady change from dark to light color, from glossy to dull,
  from liquid to solid. When the fudge begins to get dull, add the nuts
  and mix in thoroughly. Put fudge into the large buttered pan and
  press into shape with the flat of your palms. Cut into squares; store
  in airtight container if there's any left.

    3/4 lb Butter -- softened
           Fudge Cake-----
      3 c  Cake Flour
      2 c  Light Brown Sugar
  2 1/4 ts Baking Powder
    3/4 ts Baking Soda
    3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
      4 oz Unsweetened Chocolate
      6 oz Butter -- softened
 
  PREPARATION:  FROSTING.  Chop both chocolates into coarse bits and
  melt in a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water. Stir
  occasionally until completely melted.  Remove pan from hot water and
  allow the chocolate to cool until just no longer warm to the touch,
  about 20 minutes. Place the butter in a bowl and beat in the cooled
  chocolate until the mixture is evenly blended, about 3 minutes.
  
  Frosting can be stored at a cool temperature for up to 3 days, or
  several months in the freezer.
  
  Heat the oven to 350F.  Butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line
  them with buttered and floured parchment paper or waxed paper.
  
  FUDGE CAKE.  Sift the flour.  Measure 3 cups.  In a large bowl, mix
  together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt,
  breaking up any lumps of sugar.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk about 1/2 cup of the milk with the eggs and
  vanilla; set aside.  Chop the chocolate into coarse bits and melt in
  a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water. Combine the
  remaining cup of milk and the butter with the mixed dry ingredients
  and beat for 1 1/2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl twice. Add
  the egg mixture in 3 parts, scraping the sides of the bowl and
  beating for 20 seconds after each addition. Add the melted chocolate
  and beat until just incorporated.
  
  Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake in the center of the
  preheated oven until the cake springs back when lightly pressed in the
  center, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans for 10 minutes
  and invert onto racks.  Cool completely before frosting.
  
  Frost the top surface of one layer of cake and top with the second
  layer. Spread the remaining frosting on the top and sides of the
  cake. Make a decorative pattern zigzag in the frosting by pulling a
  serrated knife across the surface in a back-and-forth motion. Use a
  small spatula or spoon handle to pull out spikes of frosting all
  around the sides.
  
  Cake can be completed a day ahead and refrigerated.
  
  SERVING:  Return to room temperature if refrigerated. Cut into wedges
  and serve.
  
  Makes one 9-inch cake.

  For the crust, mix the oreos, melted butter, and sugar in a bowl.
  Press the mixture onto the bottom of your pan.
  
  For the filling, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until
  blended. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition just
  until blended. Stir in the chocolate.
  
  Pour the filling into the crust and bake for 60-65 minutes or until
  center is almost set.
  
  Note:  I always put a pan of water in the oven with the cheesecake --
  helps keep the oven moist so the cheesecake is less likely to crack.

      Title: FUDGE TRUFFLE CHEESECAKE 2
 Categories: Chocolate, Godiva, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the
  paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese at low speed for 30 to 45
  seconds, until creamy. Gradually add the sugar in a steady stream and
  beat at medium speed until blended. At low speed, one at a time, add
  the eggs, beating well after each addition. Slowly beat in the
  reserved 2 cups of chocolate ganache. Beat in the cornstarch mixture.
  Pour the filling into the prepared pan and, using a rubber spatula,
  smooth the top. Bake the cheesecake for 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1
  hour and 20 minutes, or until the center is set. (There will probably
  be cracks in the top of the cheesecake; they will shrink as the
  cheesecake cools and then will be covered with the ganache frosting.)
  Turn off the oven. Prop open the oven door with a wooden spoon and
  allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven for an hour. Set the
  cheesecake in the pan on a wire rack and cool completely.
  
  Make the chocolate truffles: Transfer the chilled 1 cup ganache to a
  pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip (such as Ateco #6). Pipe
  l-inch mounds with pointed peaks onto a clean baking sheet.
  Refrigerate or freeze the truffles for 15 to 20 minutes, or until
  just firm enough to roll. Sift a light dusting of confectioners'
  sugar over the truffles. Lightly coat your palms and fingertips with
  confectioners' sugar. With your fingertips, pinch a truffle into a
  round, then roll it gently between your palms into a round ball.
  Place the truffle on the baking sheet, and form the remaining
  truffles into rounds. Refrigerate or freeze for about 10 minutes,
  just until firm. Roll the truffles in sifted cocoa powder to coat.
  Refrigerate.
  
  Decorate the cheesecake: Run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of
  the cheesecake to loosen it from the side of the springform pan.
  Remove the side of the pan. Slide two metal cake spatulas under the
  cheesecake and transfer it to a serving platter. Using a metal cake
  spatula, spread the reserved room-temperature chocolate ganache
  evenly over the top and sides of the cheesecake. Place the chocolate
  truffles around the outside edge of the top of the cheesecake,
  spacing them evenly.
  
  Melt the white chocolate according to the instructions in the
  Chocolate Key. Using a fork, drizzle/shake the warm white chocolate
  in a decorative zigzag pattern over the top of the cheesecake.
  Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 6 hours, or overnight, before
  serving. (The cheesecake can be prepared ahead and refrigerated for
  up to 5 days.) Remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator 30 minutes
  before serving. With a sharp, thin-bladed knife, cut the cheesecake
  into 12 truffle-topped slices, dipping the blade in hot water and
  wiping it dry after each slice.

    (this is not as messy as it seems, as the dough does not stick to
  your hands, it is very buttery. It does not take much dough to cover
  the candy. If you use too much you will have to bake a little longer)
    Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
    Bake in preheated 350 deg. oven 6 to 8 minutes. Cookies will be
  soft and appear shiny but become firm as they cool. DO NOT OVER BAKE!
  Remove from cookie sheets; cool.
    In small saucepan, combine white baking bar and
  
  shortening;cook and stir over low heat until melted and smooth.
  Drizzle over cookies.
    Store in tightly covered container. Makes 6 dozen cookies.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 60 Cookies
 
      1 ea 12oz pkg chocolate chips
           -semi-sweet
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
      1 cn Condensed milk, sweetened
      2 c  Unbleached or all purpose
           -flour
    1/2 c  Nuts, finely chopped (opt)
      1 ts Vanilla
     60 ea Candy kisses, chocolate
           -SEE OPTIONS
      2 oz White baking bar or vanilla
           -flavored candy coating
      1 ts Shortening or oil
 
  OPTIONS FOR CHOCOLATE KISSES: 1. If you like caramel centers, take
  3oz of Kraft
     Caramels and add 1TB of water, heat until melted.
     Pour onto a plate so the mix will make a thin, 1/4"
     layer, place in FREEZER until it is hard.  Then,
     when dough is ready, remove the hardened caramel
     from the freezer, cut small strips 1/2" wide of the
     caramel.  Cut these into 1/2" bits, place in center
     of cookie dough and roll -- make certain dough
     completely surrounds the caramel.  It will run out
     if not completely enclosed.  Still good eatin',
     just not as pretty. 3 oz will do two recipes
     probably. 2. Get bite size Reese Peanut Butter Cups, cut into 2
     pieces, and do same as above. 3. In place of (2), use crunchy
  peanut butter, using
     the BACK of a 1/4 t to touch into the peanut butter
     and get a dab to place on the cookie dough before
     rolling.  Back of spoon allows peanut butter to be
     wiped onto the dough. Using inside spoon did not
     work for me.  Hard to get out. Try it yourself.
     Peanut butter has stronger flavor than the Reeses
     Cups, so only a dab is needed. 4. I like mint chocolate. Found some
  Mintohs at
     Kroger.  These are for candy making, baking, etc.,
     Light mint flavor.  Size of a quarter.  Place one
     of these in the dough in place of other options.  I
     tried the chocolate covered peppermint candy that
     is foil wrapped.  It was TOO strong a mint.
     Overpowering.  But that is my taste. Heat oven to 350. In medium
  sauacepan, combine chocolate chips & butter, cooking & stirring over
  very low heat until chips are melted & smooth. Add sweetened
  condensed milk & mix well.
  
  Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup & level off. Combine flour &
  nuts ~if using- in medium mixing bowl, add chocolate mixture and
  vanilla and mix well.  Shape 1 scant TB of dough around each candy
  kiss, covering completely.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet, 1"
  apart. Bake 6 to 8 minutes.  SEE NOTE 2 jgb

  The remainder of the recipe directions was to remove the cookies, even
  though then appear to be soft and glisten. They will hrden. When
  cool, heat vanilla flavored candy coating and the oil, drizzle over
  cookies. This is the Pillsbury cookoff winner, and I posted it

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
    3/4 c  Unbleached flour
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      2    Egg whites (egg replacer for
           2 eggs)
    1/2 c  Applesauce
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 tb Kahula
      1 tb Peanut butter
        x  Walnuts [opt]
 
  Spray 8 x 8 pan w/ Pam.  In medium bowl, sift together cocoa, flour,
  baking powder & salt.  (measure ingredients before sifting)
  
  Combine peanut butter with kahlua warmed in the microwave. It will be
  kind of gluey.
  
  In large bowl, mix kahlua/pb with sugar. It will be kind of crumbly
  and won't mix entirely.
  
  Wisk in egg [replacer] , applesauce & vanilla. Combineflour mixture
  w/ egg mixture.  (Add nuts, if using them) Bake 35-40 minutes @350!
  
  NOTES:I had success with EnerG egg replacer. Also, this time I
  replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with the same amount of the King Arthur
  White Wheat. (Didn't want them to be too heavy)
  
        1    Gram of Fat per Brownie One poster reports that he/she
  eliminated the Kahlua and the recipe came out okay.

      Title: FUFU
 Categories: Dumplings, Ghana
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Bisquick
  2 1/2 c  Instant potato flakes
 
  Conventional west African fufu is made by boiling such starchy foods
  as cassava, yam, plantain or rice, then pounding them into a
  glutenous mass, usually in a giant, wooden mortar and pestle. The
  first early-morning sounds of rural west Africa are often the
  rhythmic thud-thud's of fufuf being made. This adaptation for North
  Americans may trouble you if you try to stick to minimally-processed
  foods. But it's worth trying at least once with west African
  groundnut stews or Egusi soup. Recipe By : From:

  This colorful cake is dazzling, but simple. Just follow the
  directions for placing the colors and the colors will mix themselves.
  Prepare the cake mix according to directions, or use your favorite
  white cake recipe. Set aside three 1/2 cup portions of batter and
  pour the remainder into a 9' by 11' pan that had been greased and
  floured. To each of the 1/2 cup portions, add 3-5 drops of one food
  color so that you have 1/2 cup each red, blue and yellow. Next, spoon
  1/4 cup of each of the colored batters in the cake mix in the baking
  pan, making a half circle. Then, repeat the procedure with the
  remaining 1/4 cup portions (you should have a full circle of red,
  blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow.) Using a knife, blend the colors
  together with swirling strokes, so that the colors will touch and mix
  into colors of the rainbow. Bake the cake as directed. Frost with

      1 tb Butter, melted
 
  YOU WILL NEED: a medium bowl, 2 mixing spoons, measuring spoons,
  measuring cups, a pastry blender, a sharp knife, a small bowl, a
  small saucepan, a hot pad, a pastry brush, a cookie sheet, oven mitts
  and a wire rack. 1. Turn the oven on to 400 F. Measure the first 5
  ingredients in the bowl. Stir well. 2. Add the butter and cut it in
  with the pastry blender until it is in tiny pieces and the whole
  mixture is crumbly. 3. Add the milk. Stir until it pulls away from
  the side of the bowl and forms a soft ball. Turn out onto a lightly
  floured surface. Knead 8 times or until dough is smooth. Cut the
  dough into 2 equal portions. Cut each portion in half making 4 pieces
  of dough. Now divide each piece into 3, making a total of 12 pieces.
  Using the palms of your hands, roll each piece into a long rope at
  least 12 inches long. 4. Measure the borwn sugar and cinnamon into
  the small bowl. Stir well until evenly mixed. Pour onto working
  surface. Spread into a rectangle about 4x14 inches. 5. Put the second
  amount of melted butter into the saucepan.  Use the pastry brush to
  brush another rectangle on the working surface, the same size as the
  sugar-cinnamon. Roll 1 rope at a time in the butter, then roll it in
  the sugar-cinnamon to coat. Roll up like a spiral or pinwheel, like a
  snake might curl up. Pinch the last 1/2 inch of the end flat and tuck
  it underneath the bun. Arrange the buns on the greased cookie sheet.
  Bake on the center rack in the oven for 12-15 minutes. A wooden
  toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean. Use the oven
  mitts to remove the baking sheet to the wire rack. Cool. Makes 12
  buns.

      Title: FUN GWAU (STEAMED TRANSLUCENT DUMPLINGS)
 Categories: Appetizers, Pork, Chinese
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
      6    Dried Chinese black
           Mushrooms
      6 oz Shrimp, shelled & deveined
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
      6 oz Ground pork butt
    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots
    1/4 c  Finely diced water
           Chestnuts, preferably fresh
      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           Sherry
  1 1/2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Chicken stock
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           Coriander leaves
      1    Oil
           Wheat Starch Wrappers
           (see recipe)
           Light soy sauce, for
           Dipping
           Chinese mustard, for
           Dipping
 
  can be prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before
  serving.  The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy
  texture, a unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of
  flavors. Roll out the wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they
  come out rubbery.
  
       Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and
  pliable.  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut
  off the stems at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.
  
       Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse
  well with cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.
  
       Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over
  medium- high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo
  shoots, water chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until
  the pork turns white. Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and
  soy sauce. Combine the cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl
  and mix until smooth; pour into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer.
  Remove the mixture to a shallow plate and mix in the remaining green
  onion and coriander. Allow the filling to cool, then refrigerate it
  until needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
       Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls
  of dough.  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch
  circle. An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a
  tortilla press or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the
  edges to seal the filling inside.  Repeat with remaining dough and
  filling.
  
       Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled
  bamboo steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water
  for 3 minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese
  mustard. Serve with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

  "The batter for these pancakes needs to stand for about 4 hours (!
  a.m.) before you start cooking. It helps if you have a flat pancake
  griddle, but if you do not then use a heavy frypan and a good "bendy"
  utensil to turn and lift the funkaso. They are similar to (although
  smaller than) the Ethiopian injera which are made from a
  millet-relative called teff and they can be served with Ethiopian
  dishes such as the wars." 1. Sift flour into a bowl and gradually
  pour in the warm water, stirring and mixing well as you do so to make
  a smooth, runny paste. Set aside for 4 hours. 2. After this, heat the
  margarine or oil in a shallow pan or griddle plate. While it is
  warming. beat the batter with a spoon. 3. When the margarine or oil
  is hot, ladle or pour enough batter in the pan to make a saucer-sized
  pancake and cook until crsip. You can turn it once if you like but it
  is not essential. Remove and keep warm. 4. Cook the others in the
  same way and serve to accompany a main dish, or a snack with honey,

  It is hard to know if this should really be called a cake, but it has
  historically been called a cake, so it is a cake, even if it is
  fried. This desert appeals to children of all ages, it is a homey,
  and homely, classic ~ attractive in its own strange way, and very
  tasty. I have seen it served with whipped cream and fruit toppings,
  so let your imagination run wild with the toppings. This is a
  Pennsylvania-Dutch recipe, and was printed in the food section of the
  September 25, 1986 Austin American-Statesman. This recipe was
  credited to Laura Worm, Louise Lightsey, and Jeanene Demel.

  It is hard to know if this should really be called a cake, but it has
  historically been called a cake, so it is a cake, even if it is
  fried. This desert appeals to children of all ages, it is a homey,
  and homely, classic ~ attractive in its own strange way, and very
  tasty. I have seen it served with whipped cream and fruit toppings,
  so let your imagination run wild with the toppings. This is a
  Pennsylvania-Dutch recipe, and was printed in the food section of the
  September 25, 1986 Austin American-Statesman. This recipe was
  credited to Laura Worm, Louise Lightsey, and Jeanene Demel.
  
  INGREDIENT LIST
  
  Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ones.  Beat until smooth.
  
  Fill a skillet or pan with 1 inch of cooking oil and heat to a
  temperature of 375 F.  Now cover the small hole of a clean funnel
  with a finger. Then fill the funnel with the batter. Carefully move
  your finger away from the hole in the funnel, allowing the batter to
  flow into the skillet. Move the funnel to form patterns with the
  batter. Fry until golden brown, about 1 or 2 minutes, turning once
  with two spatulas. Remove to paper toweling to drain.  Place on a
  plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve hot. Repeat the process
  until all of the batter is used up.

      Title: FUNNEL CAKE III
 Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Breads, Penndutch
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/4 ts Salt (optional)
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    3/4 ts Baking powder
      2 ts Honey
      1    Egg
    7/8 c  Milk; warm
           Oil for deep frying
           Honey or maple syrup
 
  Servings:  1
  
  Sift together all the dry ingredients and then add the honey, egg,
  and the milk.  Beat until smooth.  Heat about 2 inches of the oil in
  a large cast-iron skillet. To test the correct temperature, drop a
  small piece of dough into the oil.  If it floats to the top and
  bubbles appear around the edges, you are ready to make the funnel
  cakes.
  
  Hold your finger at the bottom of the funnel and pour in some batter.
  Then, using a spiral motion, let the batter pour into the oil. The
  cakes should look like free-form spiral sculpture. Fry until golden
  brown, turning once. Drain on paper towels. Drizzle with honey oar
  maple syrup and serve hot.
  
  The amount you can make will depend upon the amount of batter your
  use for each cake.

  couple of places, then place on a baking sheet or in a lowsided
  baking dish. Roast until tender when pierced, 45 to 50 minutes. When
  cool enough to handle, cut in half lengthwise, scrape the pulp away
  from the skin with a spoon and chop pulp until reduced to a
  near-puree. In a 12-inch skillet, combine chopped eggplant, olive
  oil, tomato sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Cook over moderately
  low heat, stirring often, for 10 minutes to blend the flavors. Stir
  in 2 tablespoons of the parsley.
  
  Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until aldente.
  Drain, reserving about 1/2 cup of the cooking water. Transfer pasta
  to a large warm bowl. Add sauce and toss to coat. Add all but 1/4 cup
  cheese and toss again, adding a little of the reserved cooking water
  if needed to thin the sauceú Serve immediately on warm dishes,
  topping each portion with some of the remaining cheese and parsley.

      Yield: 16 Roulades
 
      2 c  Cold water
      1 md Potato; peeled, quartered
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Onions; finely chopped
      1 lb Veal; finely ground
      3 tb Bread crumbs; fine dry
    1/3 c  Cream; heavy
      2 tb Water
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts White pepper
      1    Egg
      2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Leeks; white only, sliced
           -paper thin
      8 tb Butter (1 stick)
    1/4 c  Cream; heavy
 
  In a 1 to 1 1/2 quart saucepan, bring the cold water to a boil. Add
  the quartered potato and boil 10 to 15 minutes or until tender. Drain
  and mash with a fork. In a small frying pan, melt 2 tb butter. When
  the foam subsides, add the onions and cook 7 or 8 minutes stirring
  frequently until they are soft and transparent but not brown. Scrape
  the onions into a large mixing bowl and add the mashed potato, ground
  veal, bread crumbs, cream, water, salt, pepper, egg, parsley and
  cornstarch. Mix well then refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Brush a
  large wooden pastry board (or another hard, smooth surface) with
  water and pat or roll out the mixture into a 16"x16" square about
  1/8" thick. Your hands or the rolling pin should be moistened with
  water to prevent the meat mixture from sticking. With a pastry wheel
  or small, sharp knife, cut the rectangle of meat into 16 squares of
  4"x4" each. Put a thin layer of leek slices (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)
  on each square. With the aid of a knife, or better still, an icing
  spatula, roll up each square, jelly-roll fashion. Ideally they should
  now be chilled but may, if necessary, be cooked immediately. Heat 2
  tb. butter in a heavy skillet. When the foam subsides, add the
  roulades, 4 at a time, turning them gently with a spatula so that
  they brown on all sides. When they are a rich brown, set them aside
  on a heated platter in a 200øF oven. Repeat the process, adding 2 tb
  fresh butter for every 4 roulades. Pour 1/4 cup heavy cream into the
  empty pan and boil it rapidly for 3 to 5 minutes, until it thickens,
  meanwhile scraping up the browned bits in the pan with a rubber
  spatula or wooden spoon. Taste for seasoning adding salt as needed
  and pour over roulades. If you must, cover the platter with foil and
  keep warm in a 200øF oven for not more than 15 minutes.

      Title: GAASTESTEG MED AEBLER OG SVEDSKER (GOOSE W/AP
 Categories: Danish, Poultry, Main dish, Fruits
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      8 lb Young goose (to 10 lb)
    1/2    Lemon
           Salt & fresh ground pepper
      2 c  Apples; peeled, cored and
           -coarsely chopped
      2 c  Dried prunes; presoaked,
           -pitted and coarsely chopped
      1 lg Onion; peeled & quartered
 
  Preheat oven to 325øF.
  
  To prepare this classic Danish Christmas dish, first wash the goose
  under cold running water. Pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels and
  rub inside and out with lemon. Lightly salt and pepper the inside and
  stuff the cavity with the coarsely chopped apples, prunes and onion
  quarters. Close by lacing skewers or by sewing with heavy white
  thread. Fasten the neck skin to the back of the goose with a skewer
  and truss the bird securely so that it will keep it's shape while
  cooking.
  
  Roast goose on a rack set in a shallow open pan for 3 to 3 1/2 hours
  (about 20 to 25 minutes per pound). As the goose fat accumulates in
  the pan, draw it off with a bulb baster or large kitchen spoon.
  Basting the goose itself is unnecessary.
  
  To test whether the bird is done, pierce the thigh with the tip of a
  small sharp knife. If the juice that runs out is still somewhat pink,
  roast another 5 to 10 minutes or until juices run clear or pale
  yellow. When done, turn off oven leaving the finished bird to set
  with the door ajar for 15 minutes to make it easier to carve.
  
  Transfer the goose to a large heated platter and remove the string and
  skewers. Scoop out the stuffing and discard it. The fruits and onion
  will have imparted their flavor to the goose but will be far too
  fatty to serve.
  
  Traditionally, poached apples stuffed with prunes (see recipe) are
  served with the Christmas goose. Red cabbage and carmelized potatoes
  (see recipes) complete the Christmas menu in Denmark.
  
  Serves 8 to 10

  Scandinavia (1968) Typos by .\\ichele
  
  .\\ichele's notes: My husband, Peter, made this dish for our 1993
  Christmas dinner. The only changes made were in the cooking process.
  A newer, better method now calls for pricking the skin of the bird in
  several places and starting the cooking with the bird breast side
  down. This allows for the most fat to run clear. And there's ALOT of
  it. Our 8 lb bird yielded over 5 cups of fat! When cooking is halfway
  done, turn the bird over and continue cooking until the juices run
  clear.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 c  "Thin" coconut milk
      1 sm Chicken, sectioned and cut
           -into bite-sized pieces
           -(bone-in)
      3    Stalks lemon grass, bruised
           -and cut into 1" lengths
      2 ts Laos powder (Ka)
      3    Green onions, finely chopped
      2 tb Coriander leaves, chipped
      4    To 6 fresh Serrano
           -chillies, seeded and
           -chopped
           Juice of 2 limes
      3 tb Fish sauce (Nam Pla)
 
  Here's another classic "Tom Yam" type chicken soup. The "Laos" powder
  is dried galangal, powdered.  Unlike ginger, dried galangal seems to
  retain most of it's character. If you use canned coconut milk, the
  "Thin" milk is the more watery liquid in the can.  The thick
  condensed stuff is coconut "cream" (not to be confused with the
  syrupy sweet coconut cream used for Pina Coladas). If you shake the
  can up and combine the two, you have thick coconut milk.
  
  A lovely lemony, creamy soup, Dom Yam Gai calls for chicken pieces cut
  through the bone with a heavy cleaver, Chinese style. If you find
  gnawing on chicken pieces and delicately trying to remove the bone,
  vainly searching for a place to deposit it, inhibiting your dinner
  conversation, you may debone the bird and substitute chicken pieces.
  In either case, use both dark and light meats for color and nutrition.
  
  [Although if you're talking at the table, ya got no reason to be
  eating a dish this good!  S.C.  ;-} ]
  
  In a saucepan, bring the "Thin" coconut milk to a boil. Add the
  chicken pieces, lemon grass and Laos powder. Reduce heat and simmer
  until the chicken is tender, about 15 minutes. Do not cover as this
  will tend to curdle coconut milk.  When the chicken is tender, add
  the green onions, coriander leaves and chillies. Bring the heat up
  just below boiling. Remove the pan from heat, stir in lime juice,
  fish sauce and serve.
  
  NOTE:  Beef cut into thin strips or firm white fish pieces may be
  substituted for chicken.

           -into bite-sized pieces
           -(bone-in)
      3    Stalks lemon grass, bruised
           -and cut into 1" lengths
      2 ts Laos powder (Ka)
      3    Green onions, finely chopped
      2 tb Coriander leaves, chipped
      4    To 6 fresh Serrano
           -chillies, seeded and
           -chopped
           Juice of 2 limes
      3 tb Fish sauce (Nam Pla)
 
  Here's another classic "Tom Yam" type chicken soup. The "Laos" powder
  is dried galangal, powdered.  Unlike ginger, dried galangal seems to
  retain most of it's character. If you use canned coconut milk, the
  "Thin" milk is the more watery liquid in the can.  The thick
  condensed stuff is coconut "cream" (not to be confused with the
  syrupy sweet coconut cream used for Pina Coladas). If you shake the
  can up and combine the two, you have thick coconut milk.
  
  A lovely lemony, creamy soup, Dom Yam Gai calls for chicken pieces cut
  through the bone with a heavy cleaver, Chinese style. If you find
  gnawing on chicken pieces and delicately trying to remove the bone,
  vainly searching for a place to deposit it, inhibiting your dinner
  conversation, you may debone the bird and substitute chicken pieces.
  In either case, use both dark and light meats for color and nutrition.
  
  [Although if you're talking at the table, ya got no reason to be
  eating a dish this good!  S.C.  ;-} ]
  
  In a saucepan, bring the "Thin" coconut milk to a boil. Add the
  chicken pieces, lemon grass and Laos powder. Reduce heat and simmer
  until the chicken is tender, about 15 minutes. Do not cover as this
  will tend to curdle coconut milk.  When the chicken is tender, add
  the green onions, coriander leaves and chillies. Bring the heat up
  just below boiling. Remove the pan from heat, stir in lime juice,
  fish sauce and serve.
  
  NOTE:  Beef cut into thin strips or firm white fish pieces may be
  substituted for chicken.

      Title: GAENG KIOW WAHN GAI (GREEN CHICKEN CURRY)
 Categories: Thai, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Chicken Breast
      2    Chicken Thighs
    1/2 c  Coconut Cream
    1/4 c  Green Curry Paste
      3 c  Coconut Milk
  1 1/2 c  Diced Eggplant
      2 tb Fish Sauce
      1 tb Palm or Brown Sugar
    1/2 ts Coriander leaves
    1/2 c  Basil leaves
      3    Red chilis
 
  1. Bone and skin the chicken breast and thighs, you should have about
     1lb of meat. Cut the meat into large, bite sized pieces, and set
     aside.
  
  2. In a medium, heavy bottomed saucepan, warm the coconut cream over a
     medium heat until it boils gently. Adjust the heat to maintain a
     gentle boil and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
     The coconut cream will become fragrant as it thickens. When you
     see tiny pools of oil glistening on the surface add the curry paste
     and stir to dissolve it into the coconut cream. Continue cooking
  for
     1 to 2 minutes, until the curry paste has a pleasing aroma.
  
  3. Add the chicken pieces and stir fry for 1-2 minutes to coat them
     evenly with the paste. Cook for about 2 minutes. Increase the heat
     and add the coconut milk, eggplant, fish sauce, sugar and salt and
     stir well. Stir in the coriander, adjust the heat to maintain a
  gentle
     active boil and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste
     and adjust the seasoning with a little more fish sauce, sugar, or
  curry
     paste.
  
  4. When the chicken is done, and the eggplant is just tender, remove
  from
     the heat and transfer to a serving bowl. Scatter basil leaves,
  chopped
     chillis and some coriander on the top. Serve.
  
  Preparation in advance:
  
  Prepare it up to the point where you add the coriander, except *DO
  NOT* add the eggplant. Cool to room temperature, cover, and
  refridgerate for up to 24 hours. To serve bring the curry back to a
  gentle boil over a medium heat. Add the eggplant and carry on with
  the normal instructions from there.
  
  An alternative to the eggplant is Snow Peas. I personally prefer
  them, but both work well.

      Title: GAENG MASAMAN NEUEA (MUSLIM BEEF CURRY)
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/8 lb Steak, cut into 2 cm cubes
      1 c  Thin coconut milk
      1 c  Thick coconut milk
      1 tb Muslim curry paste
      1 md Potato,cut into 2 cm cubes
      1 sm Onion
    1/8 lb Raw peanuts, skinned
      1 ts Cardamon pods
      1 tb Lemon juice
      3 tb Tamarind water
      1 tb Nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
 
  cooked, that is it gives off a strong curry fragrance. Return the
  meat to the pan, toss it in the paste and fry for a further 3-4 mins.
  Pourthe remainder of the coconut milk back in, and simmer for a
  further 10 mins. until the suace thickens and the oil separates and
  forms a layer on the surface. Add the potato, onion, peanuts,
  cardamon, lemon juice, tamarind water, nam pla, and the thick coconut
  milk. Simmer for a further 30 mins. or until the meat and vegetables
  are cooked. Taste and adjust the seasoning with nam pla, lemon juice
  or tamarind as necessary. A few mins before serving, add the chilli.
  
  This gaeng is popular with the Thai Muslims, and they generally would
  not eat the other varieties of Thai curry. Buddhist (and the
  Christians) Thais are not so fussy, and eat Gaeng Masaman as well as
  the rest. Naturally, this is one dish in which one would not
  subtitute pork for the beef.

  For the best flavor, however, use a whole small chicken chopped into
  small pieces with the bones; increase the cooking time until chicken
  is tender.

  For the best flavor, however, use a whole small chicken chopped into
  small pieces with the bones; increase the cooking time until chicken
  is tender.

 Categories: Candies, Indian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 md Carrots;scraped/coarse grate
      1 qt Milk
      1 c  Light cream
      1 c  Jaggery (raw cane sugar)*
    1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Almonds, blanched;pulverized

    1/4 c  Almonds; unsalted/slivered/
           -blanched/toasted
 
  * Substitute 1 cup dark-brown sugar combined with 1 tb dark molasses
  
  In a deep heavy 5- to 6-quart saucepan, combine the carrots, milk and
  cream. Stirring constantly, bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce
  the heat to moderate and, stirring occasionally, cook for 1 hour, or
  until the mixture has reduced to about half its original volume and
  is thick enough to coat a spoon heavily. Stir in the jaggery and the
  sugar, and continue cooking for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to the
  lowest possible point, add the pulverized almonds and the ghee, and
  stir for 10 minutes more, or until the halva mixture is thick enough
  to draw away from the sides and bottom of the pan in a solid mass.
  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cardamom.
  
  With a metal spatula, spread the halva on a large heatproof platter,
  mound it slightly in the center, and decorate the top with pistachios
  and slivered almonds. Serve warm or at room temperature. In India,
  gajar halva is also sometimes decorated with a special edible silver
  leaf.

  Pour Solution A into Solution B.  Do not mix. Carefully scoop us the
  GAK from the reaction solution and gently knead it. Carefully knead
  it since there will be pockets of colored reaction solution that have
  a tendency to "splurt" out at the most inopportune moment!!! Knead
  until the GAK no longer feels slippery with water/solution. Enjoy-
  This stuff is fun to make. For colors that are more intense, you
  might consider using paste-type colorings which can be found in cake
  decorating sections at cooking type stores.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Solution A:
           1 1/2 cups warm water
           2 cups elmers white glue
           Food coloring
           Mix together until

           Solution B:
           4 teaspoons borax
           1 1/3 cups warm water
           Mix together until
           --completely dissolved
 
    Pour solution A into Solution B. Do not mix!
    Lift Gak out and knead into shape.
  
    Here are some tips: Borax can be found in the laundry detergent
  section of a grocery store- such as "20 Mule Team"
    If you are going to half the recipe... use only half of Solution A
  and mix the whole amount of Solution B. The results will be the same.
  This is important..This is the only way you can half the recipe. Do
  not double the recipe and do not reuse Solution B (the borax and
  water), use only Elmer's glue. ago)

      1 c  Tomatoes; chopped fresh or

  1 1/2 c  ;water
      1 cn Mushroom stems & pcs, 4 oz
 
  The moose that is taken late in the season & destined to feed many
  Alaskan families is often a dry & lean animal. To lovers of fat beef,
  late-season moose isn't much of a treat. While living in Flennallen
  one winter, we learned from a family in Gakona how to make a sauce to
  eliminate some of the problem. It's good on fat moose or beef, too.
  
  In frying pan over medium heat bring fat to hot. Combine all
  vegetables except mushrooms in a bowl & salt & pepper to taste. Pour
  them into hot grease & saute for 3 mins. Add water & bring to a boil.
  Cook for 10 mins, stirring occasionally. Drain mushrooms, add them to
  sauce & heat for another 2 mins. Add extra liquid if mixture appears
  too dry. Serve either on or beside meat.

      Title: GALA HUA DAL (COOKED LENTILS~ PEAS~ & BEANS
 Categories: Beans, Indian
      Yield: 4 1/2 cup
 
  1 1/2 c  Yellow lentils (arhar dal)
           -or red lentils (masar dal),
           -yellow split peas or yellow
           -mung beans (moong dal)
    1/4 ts Tumeric
  4 1/2 c  Water
 
  This is the basic recipe for cooking lentils or beans. Many southern
  and southwestern regional recipes call for cooked lentils or beans to
  be stirred gently into a dish near the end of cooking. Therefore, it
  may be a good idea ot make them a day ahead and have them ready when
  you begin the actual cooking.
  
  1.  Pick lentils, peas, or beans clean and wash thoroughly in several
  changes of water.
  
  2.  Put the lentils, peas,  or beans in a deep pot along with the
  tumeric and 4-1/2 cups water; bring to a boil. (Be careful, they foam
  a lot.) Stir often to make sure they do not lump together. Cook over
  medium heat, partially covered, for 40 minutes (25 minutes for red
  lentils and mung beans).  Cover, reduce heat, and continue cooking
  for an additional 20 to 25 minutes (10 minutes for red lentils and
  mung beans) or until soft.
  
  3.  Turn off heat and measure the puree.  There should be 4-1/2 cups
  puree; if not, add enough water to bring to that quanity. For a more
  ground puree, beat lentils, peas, or beans with a whisk for 3 to 5
  minutes. Cooked dal can be kept for 3 days, refrigerated. Cooked
  lentils and beans thicken considerably and become gelatinous with
  keeping.  They also reduce in volume considerably. Therefore remember
  to make allowance for such evaporation.
  
  My Note:  I always end up beating them with a whisk as it velvetizes
  the soup.  There is no need to use something like a food processor
  .... I think it would end up making the ingredients too fine and
  would ruin the texture of the soup.  Also, I refrigerated them for
  both 1 day and then later 2 days and found that indeed, it did
  thicken .... I simply put them in a pot and added a cup or two of
  water and simmered until I got the consistency I wanted .... thick
  but with some liquid as this is not meant to be a soup in which a
  spoon will stand up

      Title: GALAKTOBOUREKO
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      6 c  Milk
      1 c  Fine semolina
  3 1/2 tb Cornstarch
      3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      6    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract (optional)
      1 tb Butter
     12    Commercial filo sheets
    3/4 c  Butter; melted & hot
      1 c  Water
      1    Lemon or orange (peel only)
      2 tb Fine brandy or Cognac (opt.)
 
  In a heavy-bottomed, 3-quart saucepan, bring the milk gradually to a
  boil; do not allow it to scorch. Meanwhile, sift the semolina,
  cornstarch, 1 cup of the sugar, and salt together and gradually add
  to the boiling milk, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Cook
  slowly over medium heat until the mixture thickens and comes to a
  full boil, then remove from the heat. Beat the eggs on high speed of
  an electric mixer. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar and continue beating
  until very thick and fluffy, about 10 minutes, then add the vanilla.
  Stirring constantly, add eggs to the hot pudding. Partially cover the
  pan and allow to cool. Butter a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and cover
  the bottom with 7 sheets of the filo, brushing butter generously
  between each and making sure that a few sheets come up the pan sides.
  Pour the custard into the pan over the filo. Cover with the 5
  remaining sheets, brushing butter between each and on the surface.
  With the tip of a very sharp knife, score the top filo sheets into
  square or diamond shapes, being careful not to score as deeply as the
  custard. Bake on the center rack of a moderate (350 F) oven for 40 to
  45 minutes, until crisp and golden chestnut in color and the custard
  is firm. Meanwhile, boil the remaining 1-1/2 cups sugar with the
  water and lemon or orange peel for 5 minutes.  Add the brandy or
  Cognac, if desired, and set aside. Remove the galaktoboureko from the
  oven and set on a cake rack. Spoon the hot syrup over the entire
  galaktoboureko, particularly the edges. Cool thoroughly before
  cutting and serving.  Store in the refrigerator.

  This recipe has invariably proved to be very popular - and rightly
  so. The combination of potato, celery and tomatoes, highlighted by
  garlic and herbs, is a memorable one. Serve it either as a meal in
  itself, with a salad, or as a side dish.
  
  Saut the sliced onion in 2 tbs of the oil over a gentle heat for 5
  minutes until it begins to brown lightly. Add the celery and cook for
  a further 5 minutes. Remove from the pan.
  
  Fry the sliced potatoes in 3 tbs more hot oil, adding more as needed,
  shaking the pan until they begin to brown. Then lower the heat, cover
  with a lid and cook for 5-10 minutes more until the potatoes are
  tender. Season to taste.
  
  Then stir in the tomatoes, garlic and herbs, along with the onion and
  celery mixture, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring all the time. Put
  into a heatproof dish and finish under a hot grill for 3-4 minutes.

 Categories: Try it, Pileggi, Poultry, Holiday, Passover
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------SEPHARDIC COOKING; MARK-----------------------
 
  ~Jewish, Greece
        1 lg Carrot, sliced
        2    Ribs celery, leaves and Stems, sliced
        3 lb Chicken; quartered, loose ~skin and fat discarded
        1 ts Salt, or to taste
      1/4 ts White pepper
        1 c  Water
  
  1.  Put the vegetables on the bottom of an oiled roasting pan; place
  the chicken quarters on top. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and pour
  the water around.
  
  2.  Cover the pan and bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 1/2
  hour. Uncover and bake for 1/2 hour more to brown the chicken. Baste
  now and then.
  
  Serve warm with rice or boiled potato.
  
  This is a simple meat roast for Passover.  It is usually served with
  Kifte de Prasa.  It so be noted that some Greek families did not eat
  boiled potatoes on Passover since they consider that the cooked
  potato "rise up" like the leavened bread.  Rice is another food that
  is forbidden on Passover, yet the Jews of India do eat rice
  throughout the year. The Passover laws vary from region to region,
  each community establishing its own tradition.

  then remove from heat. Cool to room temperature.
  
  Prepare platter, lining with lettuce leaves.  Peel and segment the
  citrus fruit if used, cutting each segment down to the back and
  fanning open to form a circle. If using pineapple, cut off top leaves
  and outer skin, as thinly as possible, from top down.  Look at the
  "eye" pattern, as it forms a spiral down the pineapple. Cut the
  spirals with a sharp knife held at about a 45 degree angle.  Cut off
  bottom.  Cut pineapple into about 5 or 6 wedges and then cut each of
  those into 1/4 inch slices. Arrange fruit on platter.
  
  Mound meat mixture onto fruit, and decorate with other garnishes.
  Serve at room temperature, or chilled.

      Title: GAME COOKING
 Categories: Game, Info, Jw
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Venison is the generic term for meat from a large group of related
  grazing animals. It includes caribou, reindeer, deer, moose and elk.
  For all practical purposes it also includes musk oxen, antelope and
  buffalo [bison]. The recipes are generally interchangeable. musk oxen
  and buffalo cuts tend to be more tender as these animals are more
  sedentary by nature.
  
  You can do anything with venison that you would beef. Just remember
  that it is drier- less fat, so steaks should be
  marinaded/tenderized/pounded and cooked just to medium, not over-done.
  
  It is important to realize that wild meat can vary in quality and
  toughness, whereas commercial beef is a pretty uniform product.
  Venison factors are:
  
  ~1- Age and sex of animal. Meat can be as tender and mild as veal in a
  young doe. (And you always get steer meat in a store never bull.
  Castration does make a difference.)
  
  ~2-Clean kill. If a deer is stalked while it is peacefully grazing and
  dropped dead in its tracks, it will taste far better than an animal
  that has been chased by hounds, then gut shot, then it runs a few
  more miles before collapsing. The blood is full of adrenaline and the
  acidic by-products of exercise and exertion and the flesh is tainted
  by the torn up organs.
  
  ~3- Aging and butchering. When I was a kid growing up in Eastern
  Ontario, we went deer hunting in the fall, when it was cool and deer
  were hung to age and tenderize, then butchered at a local abattoir
  that handled beef and pork professionally. We received nicely
  wrapped, properly cut and trimmed frozen packages. It was generally
  pretty good. Up here caribou is shot all year long and traditionally
  butchered immediately [before it spoils in the summer or freezes
  solid in the winter] And some hunters are more skilled at butchering
  than others... I have been made "gifts" of quarters of caribou that
  have been field frozen with the fur on and wrapped in green garbage
  bags and stored in somebody's back yard for a month or two! I have
  also received superb sausages made by a man who apprenticed as a
  sausage-maker in Germany.
  
  If you know where your meat came from, you will know whether it should
  tenderized or just cooked.
  
  If your steaks are coming from a commercial game farm, they will be
  from a young animal, carefully slaughtered and aged. I would treat
  them the same as any prime beef T-bone. Probably charcoal BBQ'd or
  gas grilled to just medium rare and sprinkled with a little salt and
  pepper AFTER it has been cooked... nothing fancy, no marinades and no
  strong BBQ sauces. That way you will be able to truly taste the
  venison.
  
  For wild meat you may want to marinade first, if it's tough.

      Title: GAME HENS IN CHOCOLATE SAUCE
 Categories: Game, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4    Game hens
           Salt, pepper to taste
           Olive oil
      4    Garlic cloves, finely
           -chopped
      1 tb Red wine vinegar
      3 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Dry vermouth
      2    White onions, coarsely
           -chopped
      2    Not-too-ripe Bosc pears,
           -peeled, halved, cored
     12    To 16 whole chestnuts
           -(prepared, from ajar)
      2 oz Bitter chocolate, grated
      8    Triangles of fried bread
           -(see note)
           Raisins, chopped parsley
           -for garnish
 
  This recipe was inspired by one using partridges that appeared in "The
  Taste of Spain," by Camilla Jessel.
  
  Season hens with salt and pepper. Heat a bit of oil in a large heavy
  pan and brown the birds in it on all sides. Add garlic to pan and
  stir until it takes on a pale color. Add vinegar, 2 cups of the
  stock, the vermouth and onions and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover
  tightly and cook gently until birds are very tender, about 1 hour.
  
  Heat remaining cup of stock in a pan large enough to hold the pear
  halves. Add pears and poach until barely tender; remove with a
  slotted spoon and keep warm. Add chestnuts to poaching liquid and
  simmer until heated through; remove and keep warm.
  
  Remove birds to a heated serving platter or plates. Strain cooking
  liquid, return to heat and add grated chocolate, stirring until it is
  a good sauce consistency. Pour over birds and garnish with pears,
  chestnuts, the fried bread, a few raisins and some chopped parsley.
  
  Note: To make fried bread, cut crusts from 4 slices of white bread,
  then cut slices diagonally to make 8 triangles. Fry quickly in a
  little hot oil until golden on both sides. Drain and keep warm.

 Categories: Side dish, Thai, Main dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     10 oz Straw mushrooms
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
  2 1/2 tb Gang ba curry paste, see
           -- recipe
      2 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar, optional
    1/2 c  Oriental basil, chopped
      2 ea Kaffir leaves
      6 ea Red chili peppers, cut into
           -- 4 or 5 pieces
 
  If the mushrooms are very large, cut in half; however it is
  traditional not to cut them in Thai cooking. Heat the oil in a wok
  over medium heat. Add the curry paste & stir-fry until it releases
  its aroma. Add 3 c water, mushrooms, soy sauce & sugar. Bring to a
  boil, adjust the seasonings if necessary. Add the basil, kaffir &
  chili peppers. Mix gently & serve hot with rice. NOTE: I make
  variations of this adding a bunch assorted, cubed vegetables which I
  stir-fry for a few moments before adding the water. Using the
  vegetables gives a main dish rather than just a side dish. Good
  vegetables in this curry are: eggplant, zucchini, corn, cauliflower,
  bamboo shoots (I'm not sure how Thai this ingredient is though).

      Title: GARAM MASALA 3
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  4 1/2 ts Cumin seeds
  4 1/2 ts Coriander seeds
      2 ts Black peppercorns
      1    1 1/2 inch stick cinnamon,
           Broken into small pieces
  1 1/2 ts Cardamom seeds (remove them
           From the pods)
    1/2 ts Whole cloves
 
  1. Heat a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
  ingredients, and cook them, shaking the pan, for about 5 minutes or
  until the spices are brown but not burned.
  
  2. Transfer the spices to a bowl, and let them cool. In a mortar with
  pestle or in an electric coffee grinder or in a spice grinder, grind
  the spices to a fine powder. Store the garam masala in an airtight
  jar.
  
  Makes about 1/3 cup.
  
  It comes from Jane Brody's Good Food Gourmet. at p. 247: "You can
  prepare a reasonable garam masala by combining equal amounts of
  cardamom, cumin, cinnamon, and coriander, and smaller amounts of
  ground cloves and black pepper."
  
  She also provides a "real" recipe for it at p.546 (above).
  
  I have never bothered with the "real" recipe, but have just mixed in
  the proportions given in the "easy" recipe, as needed. It's delicious
  for all your garam needs!

      Title: GARBANZO BEAN (CHICK-PEA) CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 65 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Garbanzo bean (chick-pea)
           Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
    1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
    1/2 c  Water
      2 tb Oil for glazing the tops
      1 ts Salt for the tops
 
  "Don't pass over these crackers because they sound unusual. You will
  be surprised at how delicious they are. Like garbanzo beans
  themselves, these innovative crackers are a healthful, tasty addition
  to a fresh green salad. 325~F.      20 to 25 minutes Preheat oven to
  325~F.
  
  Combine the flours, salt, and sugar in the food processor or in a
  large bowl. Cut in the shortening until the mixture is the
  consistency of coarse meal. Blend in the water to form a dough that
  will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, no more than 1/8 inch thick.
  Using a rolling pin, spatula, or your hands, lift the rolled dough
  onto a large, ungreased baking sheet. With a sharp knife, score into
  2-inch squares without cutting all the way through the dough. Prick
  each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 10 minutes. Glaze with the oil and lightly salt the tops.
  Bake for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until golden brown. Cool on a wire
  rack. Break into individual crackers when cool. Yield: 60-65.
  
  VARIATIONS: Any bean flour can be used. Purchase it at specialty or
  health food stores. Lima bean and black-eyed pea flours work well.

      Title: GARBANZO BEAN STEW
 Categories: Native amer, Stews
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Dried garbanzo beans
     10 c  Water
      4 lb Stew beef or venison, cut
           -into 1-inch cubes
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts White pepper
 
  Soak the garbanzo beans overnight in twice their volume of water. The
  beans will absorb much of the water and swell in size. The following
  day, drain and rinse the beans under cold running water. Place the
  beans in a large pot with the 10 cups of water.  Bring to a boil over
  high heat, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, 1 1/2
  hours, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.  Add the meat,
  onions, salt, and pepper, stir well and continue cooking another 2
  hours until the meat is tender and the beans are fully cooked. Serve
  hot with one of the many Indian breads, for example, Indian
  Tortillas, Adobe Bread, or Piki Bread. ***** Margaret Archuleta of
  Picuris Pueblo taught me the recipe for this simple and satisfying
  stew made with garbanzo beans.  I first tasted it while celebrating
  New Year's Day with her family.

      Title: GARBANZO PARSNIP GNOCCHI
 Categories: Pasta, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/4 tb Olive oil
      2 c  Coarsely chopped parsnips
    3/4 c  Finely diced onions
      1 tb Minced garlic
    1/2 c  Garbanzo flour
    1/4 c  Gluten flour
      2 ts Nut yeast
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
           Peanut oil; for frying
 
  Saute vegs in oil until onions are translucent and parsnips are soft.
  Process until a smooth paste is formed. Add all remaining ingredients
  except peanut oil and blend until well mixed. Heat oil in a 3" deep
  skillet to 375.  Fill the bowl of a tablespoon w/batter and use a
  second spoon to scoop it into the oil. It may help to oil the spoon,
  but I haven't had any problems.  Don't fry more than four at a time
  because they get done in less than a minute and if you leave them
  longer they'll burn and the fat content will skyrocket.  Drain and
  serve.
  
  For the tomato sauce I recomend your basic homemade tomato sauce w/o
  any bay leaf but some extra red wine. Figger it out for yourself. If
  you can't make your own tomato sauce you've already read too far;-)

  Mix together the salad dressing ingredients.  Pour over the salad,
  continuing to stir as you pour.  Toss together & refrigerate until
  ready to serve.
  
  MARK'S NOTES:  I've found that a little more oil is needed, no more
  than another 1 ts.  Lightly cooked corn is nice alternative to the
  peas. In place of the garlic powder, use 1 minced garlic clove.

      Title: GARLIC & CHEESE BETZELS (TRIANGLES)
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 32 Servings
 
      6    Eggs -- for filling
      1 c  Gruyere cheese -- freshly
           Grated
     10    Garlic cloves -- minced (10
           To 12)
     24    Sprigs fresh flat-leaf
           Parsley -- minced
      5    Fresh mint leaves -- minced
     12    Green olives, pitted --
           Minced
           Salt and pepper -- freshly
           Ground
      2 ts Sweet paprika
      2    Egg -- lightly beaten
      8    Sheets phyllo dough --
           Thawed
           Vegetable oil -- for frying
           Lemon wedges -- for garnish
 
  Preparation and Cooking: In a medium saucepan, place 6 of the eggs,
  add water to cover, and bring to a low boil. Cook the eggs for 12 to
  15 minutes. Drain and let cool. Peel, place the eggs a medium bowl,
  and mash them coarsely with a fork. Mix in the cheese, garlic,
  parsley, mint, olives, salt, pepper, paprika and 1 lightly beaten
  egg. Cover a working surface with damp towel. Carefully unwrap the
  phyllo and unfold it on the towel. With the long edge of the phyllo
  facing you, and using a sharp knife, cut vertically through the
  stacked sheets of dough to make 4 equal sections, each about 4-1/2
  inches wide. Cover with another damp towel if you are not using the
  phyllo immediately. Place l tablespoon of the filling about l inch
  from the bottom edge of one strip. Fold over a bottom corner of the
  strip to cover the filling. Continue folding as you would a flag, to
  obtain a triangular shape. Beat the remaining egg and use it to seal
  the top edge. Repeat the process until all the filling has been used.
  In a heavy, medium saucepan pour oil to a depth of 2 inches and heat
  it over medium-high heat until it reaches 325 degrees, or a piece of
  the dough sizzles instantly. Fry the pastries in batches to avoid
  crowding them, until golden, about 6 to 8 minutes, and drain them
  well on paper towels. Serve at oncew ith lemon wedges. Makes 32
  betzels.
  
  One ounce of cheese yields about 1/4 cup when grated or shredded.

      Title: GARLIC & GINGER CHICKEN BAKED IN A CLAY POT
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lb Frying chicken
      2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
      1    Knob fresh ginger, grated
           Salt and pepper, to taste
      2 ts Asian sesame oil
 
  I highly recommend the romertopf type clay pots. Especially for
  chicken. I've done several chicken recipes in mine and they all came
  out extremely savory and done to perfection. There's a unique, rich
  flavor that seems to typify food cooked in this way.  Haven't tried
  this one yet, but it's high on the list.  The ingredients are Asian,
  the technique Western. The result, I imagine, is delectable.  It's a
  very simple recipe. At least the first time I'd resist any temptation
  to embellish it. Well, maybe a few fermented black beans...  ;-}
  
  Rinse the chicken inside and out and pat dry.  Work your fingers
  under the skin of the chicken, carefully loosening skin from flesh
  across the breast and legs.
  
  Mix together the garlic, ginger, salt and pepper; rub evenly under the
  skin.
  
  Brush the chicken with sesame oil.
  
  Soak a 2-quart unglazed clay cooking pot in cold water to cover for 10
  minutes.  Drain and place the chicken breast-up in the pot. Cover and
  place in a cold oven; turn the thermostat to 475F and roast for 1
  hour.
  
  Remove pot from oven and place on a towel.  Put lid on another towel.
  (The hot clay will break if placed on a cold surface). Transfer
  chicken to a heated serving platter and drizzle with some of the
  juices left in the pot.
  
  Serves 4.

      6 lg Potatoes, scrubbed
      3 ts Olive oil
      1 tb Fine chopped fresh rosemary
           Ground black pepper
      6    Cloves garlic, peeled, cut
           -in half.
 
  Preheat barbecue to med.  heat.  Using an apple corer, carefully
  remove a plug from each potato, making sure not to go right through
  the potato. Reserve the plugs.
  
  Combine oil, rosemary and black pepper.  Fill hole in each potato
  with two garlic halves and a little oil mixture. Cut off two-thirds
  of each plug and discard. Replace remaining plug in potato and wrap
  potatoes in aluminium foil.  Cook potatooes on barbecue for 1 hr. or
  until tender. Serves 6.
  
  I also have tried these using garlic or herb butters, they work very
  well in the conventional oven.

      Title: GARLIC BREAD FETTUNTA
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        4 sl bread
  :          country-style -- sliced 1/4"
  :          thick
        1    garlic clove -- unpeeled
      1/2 c  extra virgin olive oil -- or
  :          more
  :          salt and pepper
  
  Fettunta is a contraction of the word fetta, "slice," and unta,
  "oily,"
  
  1. Toast, grill, or broil the bread slices until lightly colored on
  both sides.
  
  2. Rub the garlic clove over the bread's surface. The garlic will
  grate itself on the hardened toast and the peel will disintegrate.
  Garlic lovers should press hard.
  
  3. Drizzle at least 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, barely
  enough for any self respecting Tuscan, over each slice of toasted
  bread, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.
  
  Description and Detail from Feniger: This is, without a doubt, my
  favorite recipe in the world. It's fast, simple, calls for no special
  equipment or skills, has no cholesterol, and is open to seasonal
  adaptation with the addition of numerous toppings. Diners always seem
  to be impressed. Bread is lightly toasted, rubbed with garlic, dipped
  in newly pressed, bright green, peppery-flavored olive oil, sprinkled
  with salt and pepper. It's meatless, milkless,effortless, pleasing to
  even the most jaded palates, and involves none of the fuss usually
  associated with garlic bread Scouts can skewer their bread on a stick
  and toast over the campfire. Unsalted rustic Tuscan bread, white or
  whole wheat, sliced about 3/4 inch thick is the bread of choice for
  olive oil millers, who created this dish. Do-it-yourself bread bakers
  should refer to Carol Field's "The Italian Baker" (Harper Collins,
  1986). But almost any basic, water-based, butterless, country-style
  bread will do. A friend favors rye. Day old bread is okay. And 1
  slice per person may only be a beginning. First-rate virgin olive oil
  is a must, otherwise you'll end up with greasy bread instead of
  fettunta. Newly pressed oil, called olio nuovo, easily recognizable
  by its bright green color, cloudy with chlorophyll, found from late
  November through January in Italy, yields spectacular results but any
  quality extra virgin olive oil will do. Recipe By     :

      Title: GARLIC BREAD SALAD WITH BLACK BEANS & SALSA
 Categories: Salsa, Sandwiches, Sunset
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Garlic cloves -- peeled
      3 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 c  Tomatoes -- seeded and
           Chopped
    1/2 c  Cherry tomatoes, yellow --
           Quartered
    1/4 lb Red onion, mild -- finely
           Chopped
      2    Sliced green onions -- ends
           Trimmed
      1    Jalapeno chile pepper --
           Stem, seed, mince
      1 tb Fresh cilantro -- finely
           Chopped
      2 tb Lime juice
     30 oz Black beans, cooked --
           Canned, rinsed
      1    Baguette -- slender
           Salt and pepper -- to taste
 
  1. MAKE GARLIC PASTE - Combine garlic and olive oil in a 12-inch
  skillet (nonstick).  Stir occassionally over medium-low heat until
  garlic is golden brown and soft when pressed, about 15 minutes. As
  cloves brown, transfer from pan with a slotted spoon. Discard all but
  1 tablespoon of the cooking oil. Return garlic to pan and mash with a
  fork or potato masher.
  
  2. SALSA and MASHED BEANS -  In a bowl, mix red and yellow tomatoes,
  red and green onions, chili, cilantro, and lime juice. Drain beans,
  but about a quarter of them on a rimmed plate or shallow bowl. Drain
  liquid from tomato salsa mixture onto the plate. Mash the beans on
  the plate to a smooth paste, then stir in remaining whole beans.
  
  3.  Cut baguette in half lengthwise; broil halves 3 to 4 minches from
  heat until bread is lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Spread halves
  equally with garlic paste. Return to broiler about 10 seconds to warm
  slightly. Cut bread into 8 equal pieces and put 1 or 2 pieces on each
  plate. Mound bean mixture on bread, then top with the tomato salsa.
  Salt and pepper as wanted.
  
  Serve from 4 to 8.  Maura Devlin, "Food and Entertaining"
  
  Pat's Notes: I used 1/3 cup garlic spread (Price Club), warmed first
  in the micro at 70% 2 minutes; stirring in the oil after 1 minute. No
  yellow tomatoes so used yellow bell pepper pieces.

  spices, stirring constantly. Gradually add half-and-half and stir
  until thickened. Simmer for 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  MAKE SCAMPI:  Melt butter in large saucepan on high heat and add oil.
  Combine remaining ingredients keeping scampi aside until the last
  minute. Add scampi and saute until firm and slightly pink. Do not
  overcook. Pour scampi butter over scampi.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  I serve this over fettucini (1 1/2 lbs for a full batch). To save
  the trouble of de-veining shellfish, you can have two or three big
  ones for each person, and use small bay shrimp for the remainder.

  minutes for other preparation.

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Butter; melted
      1 cl Garlic; crushed
      4 tb Parmesan; grated
 
  Ingredients above are for a 1.5 pound loaf pan, although since these
  rolls are made on the dough cycle, I find that I can put the 1.5
  pound amount of ingredients in the 1 pound machine with no problem
  since it's not going to bake.  1 pound ingredients are listed below.
  Place roll ingredients into bread machine on dough setting and press
  start. When dough is finished, remove from machine. Turn out dough
  onto a floured countertop or cutting board.  Gently roll and stretch
  dough into a 24 inch rope.
  
  Greast an 8-inch pie pan.
  
  With a sharp knife, divide dough into 18-24 pieces. Shape into balls
  and place into pie pan. In a small bowl, combine butter and garlic.
  Pour over rolls. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Cover and let rise in
  warm oven 30-45 minutes until doubled. Remove rolls from oven.
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Put rolls in oven, bake for 10-15
  minutes until golden on top. Remove from oven, cut apart and spread
  with butter to get "yummies" in your tummies!

  water....(since I used the bouillon, I did not add the salt)...did
  not have zucchini so I used broccoli.

      1 lb (450g) chicken, cut into 1"
           -x 2" x 1/4" (2.5 cm x 5cm

    1/4 ts (1 ml) sugar
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
      3 tb (45 ml) flour
        ds Of five-spice powder
           -(optional)
      4 c  (1 L) oil
 
  I looked all through my Chinese books and the only one with a recipe
  for Garlic Chicken was one by Martin Yan. I've never made this recipe
  although I did have Garlic Chicken once in a restaurant and it was
  excellent. Here's the recipe in Martin's own inimitable words... It
  was once said in New York, "The only thing 50 cents will get you
  these days is a seat on the subway." Garlic will get you a seat in no
  time! Here's a power-packed dish that will remind you of your Italian
  mother's cooking.
  
  1.  Combine Chicken with garlic, wine, soy sauce, garlic salt and
  sugar; marinate for 2 hours. 2. Add beaten eggs and flour to chicken
  and mix well. 3. Heat oil in wok near smoke point. Reduce heat to
  medium. Deep- fry chicken for 2 to 3 minutes or until tender.
  
  NOTE: It doesn't say in the book, but the Garlic Chicken I had was
  bone-in.

      Title: GARLIC GREEN BEANS
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Green beans, ends trimmed
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 tb Red-wine vinegar
      1 tb Walnut or olive oil
    1/8 ts Salt (optional)
    1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  I tried this recipe from Jane Brody's "Good Food Gourmet" for
  Thanksgiving last year and my family really loved it! Steam beans for
  5 to 7 minutes or until tender crisp. Rinse briefly under cold water
  to preserve color, but do not chill. Cover and keep warm. In a large
  bowl, combine garlic and remaining ingredients. Add warm green beans
  and toss until well coated. If desired, you can reheat in microwave
  before serving. If you don't want such a strong flavor of garlic,
  simmer the unpeeled cloves of garlic in a cup of water for 5 minutes
  before peeling and mincing. I don't think the original recipe is too
  strong though.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 ts Coarse (kosher) salt
  1 3/4 ts Ground black pepper
      3 tb Sweet Hungarina paprika
      1 ts Dried marjoram, crumbled
    1/2 ts Dried savory, crumbled
      2 ts Finely minced garlic
     10 oz Trimmed beef shin, cut into
           -1/2" dice and chilled
     16 oz Fresh pork fat, cut into
           -1/2" dice and chilled
    1/3 c  Ice water
  1 1/4 lb Lean, trimmed pork, cut into
           -1" dice and chilled
 
  1. Mix together in a small bowl the salt, pepper, paprika, marjoram,
  savory, and garlic. 2. In the container of a food processor combine
  the beef, half the pork fat, half the ice water, and half the mixed
  seasonings (see step 1) and process to a very fine grind (if you are
  using a meat grinder, follow the directions on page 4). Scrape into a
  mixing bowl. 3. In a bowl combine the remaining seasonings, the pork,
  remaining pork fat, and remaining water. Process half of the mixture
  at a time to a coarse grind and add to the beef. Mix together very
  thoroughly, cover, and chill for 24 hours. 4. Stuff the sausage into
  casings as indicated in the general sausage-making directions on
  pages 4-5, tying links for 10 to 30 " long, depending upon your
  preferance. Both sizes (and everything in between) are considered
  traditional. Hang the sausages in a cool, airy place for several
  hours at least, or until the skin is smooth, dry, and crackly. If
  it's too hot or humid to hang the sausages, refrigerate them,
  uncovered, for at least 12 hours. To store, refrigerate for up to 3
  days, or freeze for longer keeping. TO COOK: Place one or more
  sausages in a large skillet with water to come halfway up them. Bring
  to a simmer and cook for about 8 minutes, then turn and cook for
  about 8 minutes on the other side. Pour off the water, prick the
  sausages, and cook them over moderate heat until browned on both
  sides. Makes about 2-3/4 pounds

      2 c  Thinly sliced leeks (white

    1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms, halved (if
           Small) or quartered
      2 c  Dried lentils, picked over
           And rinsed
      6 c  Boiling water
  1 1/4 ts Dried rosemary leaves
      1 ts Dried thyme or marjoram
           Leaves
      2 lg Bay leaves
    1/4 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
      2 lg Red bell peppers, roasted,
           Seeded, and diced
    1/2    To 3/4 cup minced fresh
           Parsley
      2    To 3 teaspoons balsamic
           Vinegar
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper to taste
 
  Heat broth in pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add garlic,
  stirring continually, adding more water if necessary to keep from
  burning. After a minute or two, add leeks and continue cooking, still
  stirring for another minute.  Add the carrots, celery, mushrooms,
  lentils, boiling water, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and red pepper
  flakes.
  
  Lock lid in place.  Over high heat, bring to a high pressure. Lower
  the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 7
  minutes. Allow the pressure to come down naturally or use a
  quick-release method. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to
  allow any excess steam to escape. If the lentils are not quite
  tender, either return to high pressure for a few more minutes or
  replace (but do not lock) the lid and simmer until the lentils are
  done.
  
  Remove the bay leaves.  Stir in the roasted red bell peppers,
  parsley, just enough vinegar to bring up the flavors, and salt and
  pepper to taste.
  
  Serves 6-8

  Preheat oven to 325 *large heads of (about 50 cloves) **or as needed
  As the coating hardens and bakes on the chicken, the flavors and
  juices are all sealed in.. Best chicken you ever ate. Put peeled
  garlic cloves in blender with 1/2 cup of olive oil and Cajun spices.
  Blend until creamy consistency, add more oil if needed. Place the oil
  and garlic mixture in a large bowl. Add flour slowly, mixing until a
  very heavy, thick, smooth mud like consistency is achieved. With
  string, tie the chicken wings and the legs tight against sides of
  carcass. Using a spatula, completely coat chicken with Garlic Mud, as
  evenly as possible, using it all. Fill in all crevices between wings
  and legs. Place on a rack, breast side up, in a pan and put in
  preheated oven. Roast whole chicken about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours or
  until coating is browned well. If using cutup chicken, coat each
  piece very well, place on a rack and roast for a shorter time, until
  chicken coating is brown. Serve chicken with the crisp pieces of
  Garlic coating .. I would suggest using a vertical roaster. It is a
  wire stand that the chicken slips down on and is vertical. Set your
  bottom rack as low as possible to accommodate in oven. Even a lower
  heat setting with a longer roast time is even better.

      Title: GARLIC PANCAKES WITH HAM SAUCE
 Categories: Garlic, Pancakes, Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Butter
      3 tb Rubbed sage
      3    Large heads fresh garlic
      2 c  Self rising flour
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Oil
  3 1/2 c  Milk
      9    Large cloves fresh garlic,
           -minced
      1 lb Lean ham, minced
 
  Mix together 12 tablespoons (1-1/2 sticks) butter and sage; reserve.
  Remove as much outer skin from garlic as possible without piercing
  the cloves' covering. Set garlic in saucepan, cover with water and
  boil gently about 45 minutes or until cloves are quite soft. Remove
  from heat. When cool enough to handle squeeze each clove to remove
  cooked garlic by grasping clove at tip and pulling down toward base.
  In mixing bowl, beat garlic with fork until smooth. Add to garlic
  same amount (at least one cup) flour, eggs, oil and 1-1/2 cups milk
  to make pancake batter. Add minced garlic to batter and set aside.
  Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter and keep warm. While waiting for
  batter to work, place half the sage butter (6 tb) in saucepan, add 6
  tb flour to make a roux and cook at medium temperature, stirring
  frequently, to brown. Meanwhile in skillet, place remaining 2 tb of
  remaining sage butter and add ham. Heat thru, but do not burn. When
  roux is nicely browned, add remaining 2 cups milk. Allow to thicken,
  stirring frequently. Add ham and skillet drippings and mix to make
  ham sauce. Keep warm. Heat griddle or clean skillet and grease
  lightly with a bit of remaining sage butter. Drop batter by spoonfuls
  onto griddle to make silver dollar-sized pancakes. Serve with melted
  butter and ham sauce. Makes 2 dozen pancakes. NOTE:Cooking the garlic
  until it is soft changes its flavor from pungent to sweet and
  nut-like -- a very good addition to pancakes and a pleasant
  compliment to the smokiness of the ham sauce. Serve for breakfast,
  brunch, lunch or even a light supper.

      Title: GARLIC PICKLES
 Categories: Relishes
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
      4    Heads of Cauliflower
      4    Heads of Green Cabbage
      1 bn Fresh Carrots
      1    Head of Garlic
      1 bn Celery
      4 lb Kirby Cucumbers
     15 tb Salt
     10 l  Hot water
      2 tb Mustard seeds
      2 tb Peppercorns
      4    Bay leaves
 
  These are the approximate ingredients you would need to fill up a 10
  liter barrel. Peel garlic and cut each clove in half. Peel carrots.
  Wash vegetables. Cut cabbage, carrots and celery into quarters. Break
  apart cauliflower. Leave cucumbers or tomatoes whole. With cabbage,
  discard outer leaves and cut off the hard part at the base. With the
  cauliflower, leave alittle it of the leaves on for taste but discard
  the hard part of the stem. Mix vegetables in layers so all of one
  kind is not next to the other. Put in the vegetables, garlic, then
  vegetables again, and so on. Add 1 heaping tablespoon of salt for
  each liter of hot water that you will add to the barrel.  After the
  barrel is full with the vegetables and water, add 5 more tablespoons
  of salt on top, along with 2 tablespoons of mustard seeds, 2
  tablespoons peppercorns and 4 bay leaves. You can use a cheescloth
  bag to put the mustard seeds and peppercorns in or just throw them in
  loosely. Use clean wood sticks or empty glass bottles on top to hold
  down all vegetables under the water, if necessary. It's important for
  them to be covered at all times.  Mix the barrel (if it's large, it
  can be rolled on the floor!) when done and shake it again each day
  for the next few days. It's important to make sure it's being mixed
  well. It should be ready in about 10 days to eat.  Kirby cucumbers
  may take a few days longer. Taste the liquid after the first couple
  of days, as you may need to add an additional tablespoon of salt or
  two.  It's important not to add too much salt in the beginning but to
  keep the balance constant and to add alittle more as the salt is
  absorbed.  In our case, we added 3 tablespoons of salt on the sixth
  day, but this could change according to what you put in and the size
  of your barrel.

  SEPARATE THE GARLIC CLOVES and remove their papery husks. Slice each
  clove into halves or, if large, thirds. Peel the potatoes (unless
  they are newly harvested), quarter them and slice thinly. Put the
  garlic, potatoes, parsley and butter in a small sauce- pan, add water
  to cover by 2 inches and lightly salt. Bring to a boil, lower the
  heat, and simmer, partially covered, until the potatoes and garlic
  are soft and the water has cooked away, about 25 minutes. Pass the
  potatoes and garlic through a food mill. Don't use a food processor
  or blender as it will give the puree a gooey, unpleasant texture. If
  you don't have a food mill, mash the potatoes by hand, then work them
  through a strainer for a smooth texture or leave it a little rough
  and irregular. Stir in the milk or cream and additional butter, if
  desired. Add salt to taste and season with pepper.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Homemade garlic roaster
 
     Making roasted garlic is simple and easy, even without one of
  those "in" garlic roasters!
  
     Peel slightly, and cut the whole head of garlic in half
  horizontally. Put both halves cut side up in a baking dish. Add about
  1/4 c. chicken stock, if you're so inclined. Drizzle both halves with
  olive oil, and sprinkle with rosemary, if you like.  Cover with foil.
  
     Bake at 350 F. for 45 min., or until garlic is soft. Use a knife or
  spoon to dig out the now-soft cloves of garlic, and smear on toasted
  French rounds.

      2 ts Olive oil
      1 sm Clove garlic or 1/2 large,-
           -peeled and crushed

  Bring the chicken broth to a boil.  In a small skillet, heat the oil.
  Add the garlic and saute until golden and aromatic. Place the bread
  in a large soup bowl, pour the oil and garlic over it, add the
  boiling chicken broth, and immediately break the egg into the soup.
  It will cook in 2 to 3 minutes.  Add salt and pepper, and sprinkle
  with the parsley and cheese.
  
  NOTE:  There are dozens of quesos blancos, or white cheeses, which is
  exactly how the name translates. Some are soft, some fresh, but many
  aged. Queso blanco generally is mild flavored, though some of the
  aged ones can be quite tangy.  They are found in markets in Florida
  and in most cities with colonies of residents of Caribbean, Cuban, or
  Mexican ancestry. Try the cheeses, and choose the one that suits your
  taste.

  This recipe is called garlic soup because it has so much garlic in it
  but it is actually a very hearty soup with a very sweet garlic
  flavor. It is well worth the time it takes to peel the garlic but you
  must use fresh garlic do not replace with dried minced. Place 2 cups
  of the water in a large stock pot. Add the whole garlic cloves and
  cook over medium heat for 15 min. Remove the garlic cloves and mash
  them thoroughly before processing. Blend in a food processor. Add the
  remaining 2 1/2 qts water the barley and the wild rice. Bring to a
  boil cover and simmer for 15 min. Add the remaining ingredients bring
  to a boil turn down to simmer and cook until tender about 30-45 min.
  This soup tastes best if made a day or two in advance to give the
  flavors a chance to blend. Nutrition (per serving): 274 calories

    1/3 c  Plus 1 Tablespoon vegetable

    1/3 c  Water
      1    Egg, lightly beaten, for
           Glazing the tops
 
  "The ever-popular garlic imbues these crackers with an unmistakable
  personality. They stand alone and also go well with cold, crisp
  cucumber slices. 325~F. 30 to 35 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  Stir together the poppy seeds, flour, sugar, salt, and pepper in the
  food processor or in a large bowl. Add the garlic and mix well.
  
  Cut the shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse
  meal. Blend in enough of the water to form a dough that will hold
  together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/8 inch thick. With a cookie
  cutter, cut into 2-inch circles and place on an ungreased baking
  sheet. Prick each circle 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Brush
  the tops with the beaten egg, if desired.
  
  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, turning over once after about 15 minutes.
  Remove when the crackers are lightly browned and crisp. Yield: 50-55.
  
  VARIATION: In place of the garlic, use 1/3 cup finely minced fresh
  onion.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 sm Onion; chopped very finely
     40 g  Butter
    175 g  Mushrooms
           - chopped very finely
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
      2 tb Parsley, finely chopped
      1 tb Parmesan, grated
      2    Eggs
     50 g  Fromage frais
           Salt and pepper
      2 lg Crusty rolls
     25 g  Butter; melted
 
  Crisp, golden bread shells enclose a mouth-wateringly smooth, light
  filling of mushrooms and fromage frais with herbs. This starter is a
  delight - no problem with leftovers here.
  
  Cook the chopped onion in the butter gently for 4-5 minutes until
  soft and translucent, then turn the heat up and toss in the chopped
  mushrooms. Stir-fry so that they are well coated with the butter, and
  cook for 3-4 minutes until they are crisp and hot. Turn the heat down
  and stir in the garlic and parsley. Cook for a minute or so gently,
  then add the Parmesan.
  
  Beat the eggs thoroughly and scramble them lightly into the mushroom
  mixture so that they are creamy, then cool. Mash the fromage frais and
  combine with the mushroom mixture. Season to taste and leave to one
  side.
  
  Cut the rolls in half and scoop out the bread in the middle, leaving
  the crusts as shells. Brush with melted butter and crisp in a warm
  oven for 10 minutes. Pile the warm mushroom mixture into them and
  serve at once.

  sage with any of the following fresh herbs: marjoram; oregano; thyme;
  rosemary or tarragon. Conversely, reduce the amount of sage & add a

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
      1    1" cube ginger
           - peeled and minced
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
      1 tb Cider vinegar
      1 tb Mirin (sweet rice wine)
      1 ts Hot sesame oil
 
  SIFT THE FLOUR, SALT, PEPPER and 2 teaspoons of the sugar into a large
  bowl. Make a well in the center and pour the eggs into it. Stir just
  enough to combine the ingredients. In a medium skillet set over
  moderate heat, stir-fry the pork, scallions, and two-thirds of the
  garlic in the sesame oil for 8-to-10 minutes, until the pork is no
  longer pink; do not brown the meat. Add the asparagus, toss for
  1-or-2 minutes over moderate heat, then allow the mixture to cool to
  room temperature. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining
  ingredients, except the vegetable oil, to make a dipping sauce. When
  the pork mixture is cool, stir it into the reserved batter. Heat the
  vegetable oil in a large skillet over moderately high heat until
  ripples show on the skillet bottom. Half fill a 1/4-cup measuring cup
  with the batter and drop the batter into the hot oil, evening up the
  ragged edges of the pancake. Add 3 more pancakes to the skillet,
  smoothing the edges as before, and brown them for 1-to-1 1/2 minutes
  per side. Drain them on paper towels, then keep them warm on an
  uncovered platter in a 250F oven. Fry the rest of the pancakes,
  adding more vegetable oil to the skillet if needed. Serve the
  pancakes hot with the dipping sauce.

           Making a sandwich special.
           A sprig of parsley,or a
           Sculpted radish is a
           Compliment in every sense
           Of the word. Like
           Serving wine in a wine
           Glass instead of a
           Coffee  mug.
           Even something as casual
           As a sandwich ought to be
           Pleasing to the eye as well
           As the palate.
           The following list
           Contains a wide selection
           Of other garnishes in
           Which you'll find
           Something suitable for almot
           Any occasion of
           Sandwich combination.
           Some of the garnishes, such
           As horseradish sauce,and
           Relishes, are also
           Excellent on the
           Sandwiches themselves.
 
  Apples--- Cubed,sliced, in rings, rolled in paprika, minced parsley,
  chives or curry powder. .............................................
  Cheese--- Cubes,sliced, rolled into small balls, then rolled in
  paprika, parsley,curry powder, saffron, nuts or chives.

  quartered, halved, sieved, then mixed with parsley, chives, chopped
  dill, or capers. ....................................................

  or cheese. ....................................... Relishes--- Such
  as tomato and onion, pickled beets,spiced green beans, curried tomato

  slaw, pickled cauliflowers. Many of these are excellent on the

      Title: GARY'S BEEF STROGANOFF
 Categories: Beef, Russian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Beef, 1" cubes
  1 1/2 lb Mushrooms
      3    Onions
      2 tb Dill, fresh
     25 oz Red Wine, dry, full bodied
  1 1/2 c  Sour cream
      1 tb Tomato paste
      3 tb Olive oil
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      1    Bay leaf
      2 c  Beef stock
           Salt
           Pepper
           Flour for dredging
 
  Peel and chop onions.  If large mushrooms are being used, slice into
  rather large slices.  I prefer to use small mushrooms and leave the
  whole.
  
  Dredge beef cubes in flour and give them a light coating. Heat a large
  stewing pot and add olive oil. Brown beef cubes thoroughly in olive
  oil. Add onions, garlic and mushrooms and saute lightly. Add red wine
  (all) and enough beef stock to barely cover the ingredients. Add bay
  leaf (broken) and   dill.  Salt and pepper to taste. Add tomato
  paste. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 2 hours or
  until beef is very tender. The cooking liquid will thicken from the
  flour in which you dredged the beef. The desired result is that the
  ingredients are coated with a thick gravy. If more liquid is needed
  during the cooking process, add additional beef stock sparingly. Be
  careful that you scrape the bottom of the pot when stirring to
  prevent flour from sticking and burning. Just before ready to serve,
  mix in 1 1/2 cups sour cream. Place into a casserole dish or tureen
  and garnish with sprigs of fresh dill. Serve with rice or buttered
  noodles.

  1 1/2 c  Onions, finely chopped
  1 1/2 ts Olive oil
      1 tb Garlic, finely minced
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 c  Tomatoes, peeled,
           -seeded and diced.
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Coriander, finely
           -chopped [optional]
           Sherry, dry, to taste
 
  Put the beans, ham hocks, water and salt in a kettle and bring to a
  boil. Cover and let simmer 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until beans are
  thoroughly tender. Remove the ham hocks and set aside.
  
  Drain the beans and reserve both them and the cooking liquid. There
  should be about 6 cups of beans and about 4 cups of liquid. Add
  enough broth to the liquid to make about 6 cups.
  
  Put the beans in the container of a food processor or blender, and
  blend as thoroughly as possible.  Add a little of the liquid and
  continue blending. Combine the pureed beans and remaining liquid in a
  large bowl.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy kettle and add the peppers, onions, garlic and
  cumin. Cook, stirring, until the onions are wilted. Add the tomatoes
  and the vinegar. Let simmer about 15 minutes. Meanwhile cut up ham
  hocks.
  
  Add the pureed bean mixture to the cooked tomato mixture. Add the
  chopped ham and coriander. Serve in hot soup bowls with about a
  tablespoon or so of sherry (if desired) in each serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Soup with Black Beans and Ham Hocks -- Here is a hearty soup for
  those cold winter evenings. This is a rather messy soup to make, but
  well worth the effort. Yield: Serves 8-12.
  
  *  I skip the sherry and add a spoon of sour cream or yogurt. If your
  palate can handle them, try adding pickled jalapeno peppers.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: GARY'S CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE
 Categories: Desserts, Pies, Chocolate
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Pie shell, 9" or 10"
      2    Chocolate Pudding (double
           -recipe)
      1 pt Whipping Cream
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      3 tb Confectioner's Sugar
           Chocolate shavings (semi-sw)
 
  Make a double batch of Gary's Chocolate Pudding increasing the
  cornstarch to about 4 1/2 tb per batch (8-10 total). Chill
  thoroughly. This pudding will be extremely thick. Make or purchase
  your favorite pie shell. I personally like the good old fashioned,
  plain pie shell. My family seems to prefer a cookie type of shell. If
  you make your own, you must pre-bake it as this pie requires NO
  BAKING. Whip cream with confectioner's sugar and vanilla extract
  until thick and fluffy. Take 1/2 of the whipped cream and add to the
  chocolate pudding. Because the pudding is so thick, you will probably
  want to use an electric mixer for this task. Mix until all of the
  whipped cream is thoroughly incorporated. Fill pie shell with the
  pudding-whipped cream mixture.  Place remaining whipped cream into a
  piping bag and pipe onto top of pie. Shave bittersweet chocolate on
  top as garnish. Cover pie and place into refrigerator for 2-3 hours
  to allow the cornstarch that is in the confectioner's sugar to set.

      Title: GASCONY LAMB CASSEROLE
 Categories: Pork, Lamb, Casseroles
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Lamb cut into 1in chunks
      8 oz Pork belly cut into 1in
           - chunks
      6 oz Dried cannellini beans
      1    Olive ciabatta
      2    Spanish onions
     24    Cloves garlic
           Olive oil
      2    50g tins anchovy fillets
    3/4 pt Red wine
      1    284ml fresh chicken stock
           Green vegetable
           French bread to serve
           Salt & pepper
 
  You will need a large frying pan and an earthenware casserole with a
  lid.
  
  Preheat the oven to gas mark 2 300øF 150øC.
  
  Start the recipe the day before it is needed by bringing the beans to
  the boil in plenty of water (do not add salt) and simmering for 10
  minutes. Drain the beans and discard the cooking water. Put the beans
  back into at least 4in of fresh, cold water and leave them to soak
  overnight.
  
  Reduce the ciabatta loaf to rough breadcrumbs.  Peel the onions and
  chop into 1/2in pieces.  Peel all 24 garlic cloves - boring but worth
  it in the end! Pour in enough olive oil to cover the bottom of a
  large, heavy frying pan and saut the onions (not the garlic) over a
  medium heat for about 15 minutes until they have taken on some
  colour. Using a slotted spoon, remove the onions from the pan and put
  into a large earthenware casserole.
  
  Sprinkle salt lightly and grind black pepper lavishly over the chunks
  of lamb.  Add some more olive oil to the frying pan, turn the heat up
  high and in 2 or 3 batches sear the lamb cubes quickly on all sides.
  Remove each batch to the casserole as soon as it has browned. You
  might need to add a little more oil to the frying pan as you go
  along, but remember to heat it well before adding the lamb.  Once all
  the lamb has been browned, put the frying pan to one side for a
  moment while you add the garlic clove and whole anchovy fillets to
  the casserole, tucking them well down into the layers of meat.
  
  Return the frying pan to a high heat and 'deglaze' it by adding the
  red wine and bringing it to a fast boil for 3 minutes, while
  vigorously scraping all the browned sediment into the wine. Now add
  the stock and continue cooking for a further 2 minutes after the
  liquid returns to the boil.  Now pour everything from the pan into
  the casserole. Give it a good stir, put the lid on and place in the
  slow preheated oven for about 2 hours, until the meat and beans are
  both very soft and tender.
  
  When the casserole is cooked remove it from the oven and turn the
  grill on to a high setting.  Dredge the breadcrumbs over the lamb in
  a thick layer and trickle a little olive oil over the top. Place
  under the grill for a minute or two until you have a golden brown
  crust. Serve with a crisp green vegetable and warm french bread.

           Piping bag
 
  Using a bowl and whisk, beat the butter until smooth; add the sugar
  and beat for 3 minutes. Still beating, add first one egg, then the
  other and finally beat in the flour, baking powder and orange flower
  water. The mixture should be very smooth.
  
  Preheat the oven to 200 oC / 400 oF.
  
  Butter the inside of the cake tin and sprinkle with flour. Turn over
  the tin and tap out the excess flour. Fill the piping bag with some
  of the egg-sugar-...-mixture. Starting from the outside and working
  inwards, pipe the mixture into a spiral so that the bottom of the tin
  is entirely covered, with no gaps between the spirals.
  
  Carefully spoon the creme patissiere into the centre of the tin,
  spread it out slightly, but leave at least 2 cm / 3/4 in uncovered
  all round the edge of the tin.
  
  Continue to pipe spirals from the outside inwards, piping one on top
  of the other, so that the creme patissiere is complerely enclosed on
  all sides by the egg-sugar-...-mixture.
  
  Brush the top of the tart with the egg yolk-milk-mixture, score a
  lattice pattern with a fork and cook in the preheated oven for 45
  minutes.
  
  Leave to cool, then unmould on to a wire rack.

      Title: GATEAU DE MOUSSE A LA NECTARINE
 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Nectarine mousse:
  1 1/2 lb Nectarines
    1/2 c  Sugar
      5 ts Unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Peach schnapps
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream, well chilled
           Genoise cake (see recipe)
           Peach syrup:
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Peach schnapps
           Peach glaze:
  1 1/4 ts Unflavored gelatin
    3/4 c  Peach preserves or jam
      3 tb Peach schnapps
 
  Halve, pit, and chop nectarines and, in a heavy saucepan, combine
  them with sugar and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil, stirring, and
  cook it at a slow boil, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. In a
  food processor, puree the mixture and force it through a fine sieve
  into a large bowl, pressing hard on the solids. In a small saucepan,
  sprinkle gelatin over the lemon juice and schnapps, let it soften for
  5 minutes, then heat mixture over low heat, stirring, until gelatin
  has dissolved. Stir gelatin into nectarine puree, blending the
  mixture well. Let it cool to room temperature. In a chilled bowl,
  beat the cream until it holds soft shapes, (not as stiff as soft
  peaks) and fold it into the nectarine mixture. Trim the Genoise and
  cut it into three layers, horizonally. Peach Syrup: In a small
  saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil,
  stirring until sugar is dissolved, and stir in the schnapps.  Let the
  syrup cool to room temperature. Assembly:     Center one layer in the
  bottom of a 9-1/2-inch springform pan and brush with half the peach
  syrup. Pour half the mousse over the cake and top it with another
  layer of Genoise. Brush with the remaining peach syrup and pour the
  remaining mousse over the cake, rapping on the side of the pan to
  expel any air bubbles and smoothing the surface. Chill for 2 hours,
  or until it is set. Peach Glaze: In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin
  over 3 Tbsp cold water and let it soften for 5 minutes. In a small
  saucepan, combine the preserves and schnapps, bring mixture to a
  boil, stirring, and simmer it for 1 minute. Remove pan from heat, add
  gelatin mixture, stirring until gelatin is dissolved, and strain the
  mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on the
  solids. Assembly:      Pour all but about 2 Tbsp of Peach Glaze over
  top of the mousse cake, covering it completely, and chill the cake
  for 2 hours, or until glaze is set. While cake is chilling, in a food
  processor, grind the remaining Genoise layer into fine crumbs. Toast
  the crumbs in a jelly-roll pan in a preheated 350f oven for 5-8
  minutes or until they are golden. Reserve. Cut half the nectarine
  into thin slices, and arrange them decoratively on top of the cake in
  a pinwheel pattern. Brush the remaining glaze over the nectarine
  slices and chill the cake, covered, for 1 hour, or until the newly
  applied glaze is set. Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan and
  remove the side of the pan. Working over a sheet of wax paper, coat
  sides of cake with the cake crumbs. Let cake stand at room
  temperature for 20 minutes before serving.

  occasionally, until rice absorbs all liquid, about 1 hour. Remove
  from heat, scrape seeds from vanilla bean into rice, discard pod. Set
  aside to cool to room temperature.
  
  Pour 1 c sugar into a skillet (shake so the sugar spreads evenly) and
  place over medium-high heat. Cook, without stirring, until sugar
  begins to melt, about 2 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon until
  golden and just beginning to foam, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat
  and carefully pour into a 9" baking pan, and (working quickly) tilt
  to cover bottom and sides.
  
  Preheat oven to 375.  Stir egg yolks and raisins (discard rum) into
  rice. Beat egg whites until foamy. Slowly add 1 T sugar, beat until
  soft peaks form, then fold into rice mixture. Transfer to caramelized
  pan. Set pan in a shallow pan of water (bain marie) and bake until a
  knife inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool
  slightly in pan, then turn out onto a platter.  Swerve with creme
  anglaise if desired.

  stay on the surface for a while before sinking).
  
  Beat the butter till it's the same consistancy as the creme. Mix the
  two together and add the coffee extract.
  
  Boil the sugar and water for syrup, add rum.
  
  Boil the sugar and water for caramell, take it to the point where it
  just starts to change color. Remove, dunk the nuts in and let cool.
  You will have to crush the chopped walnuts, as they will now be a big
  sticky mess.
  
  Cut the cake in half, spread with syrup, add a layer of butter cream,
  sprinkle with chopped nuts, spread the top part with syrup, place on

  Gateaux Jos. Louis
  
  Home-made versions of this best selling commercial snacking cake turn
  up in recipe collections throughout the Beauce. A product of the
  giant Vachon bakery at St. Marie, it was launched by founder-bakers
  Arcade and Rose-Anna Vachon who named it for their eldest two sons
  Joseph and Louis and not, as some believe , after the heavyweight
  boxing champion, Joe Louis. Home recipes use a drop-cookie method and
  ~sometimes- a marshmallow filling. The baking cake is made
  automatically with a diameter of 3 1/2 inches (9 cm). To achieve a
  symmetrical look and a light texture, I adapted a recipe belonging to
  Mariette Scully Bourque of Notre Dame des Pins to the muffin tin.
  
  CAKE: Grease 12 medium muffin tins or 24 small ones. In a large bowl,
  cream butter and sugar together until fluffy. Measure milk into a 1
  cup measure and stir in vinegar, then baking soda. In another bowl,
  sift or mix together flour, baking powder, cocoa powder and salt.
  Combine dry ingredients with butter mixture with milk; stir in
  vanilla. Fill prepared muffin tins half full of batter. Bake in a
  preheated 350F oven for about 10 minutes or until a tester inserted
  in centre comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in pan. Turn out onto
  rack and cool completely.
  
  VANILLA FILLING: In top of a double boiler, set over boiling water,
  combine egg whites, granulated sugar, salt and water. With an
  electric mixer, beat until stiff and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes.
  Remove from heat and beat in vanilla.
  
  CHOCOLATE ICING: Cream soft butter with cocoa powder. Blend in cream
  and vanilla. Stir in sifted icing (confectioner's) sugar until icing
  is of spreading consistency.
  
  Slice cakes in half horizontally. Fill with Vanilla Filling and
  spread tops and sides with Chocolate Icing.

      Title: GATEAUX PIMENTS
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Chana dall (split
           -yellow peas)
      3 sm Onions (button-sized)
      6    Onion springs
      4    Watercress sprigs
      2    Green chilies
      1    Parsley sprig
      1 ts Turmeric
      1 ts Thyme
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper,
           -freshly ground
 
  Soak the dall in cold water for a day, then drain thoroughly.
  
  Chop all the vegetable ingredients finely.  Place the dall in a food
  processor and process to a paste. Decant into a bowl, add turmeric,
  salt and pepper, and vegetable ingredients and mix well.
  
  Heat oil in a deep-frying pan.  When it is hot, roll walnut-sized
  pieces of the paste in the palm of the hand and drop in to the oil to
  fry until golden brown. Remove from the oil and drain the gateaux on
  kitchen towels. Serve hot, with drinks.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Savoury spice balls -- This recipe is from the kitchen of Fred
  Hopper, and is originally from the isle of Mauritius. Fred often
  serves these as delicious late-night snacks, to accompany drinks.
  
  *  The choice of drinks served will depend on how spicy you make the
  gateaux: cool beer or lager usually goes down well.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate
  : Time:  1 day soaking dall.  30 minutes preparation, 10 minutes
  cooking. : Precision:  Weighing of ingredients is best, but measures
  can be approximate.

      Title: GAYE'S SOURDOUGH TIPS
 Categories: Breads, Breadmaker, Sourdough
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           From: gaye levy ** dtxt63a
 
  You will find that your sourdough breads will have more "tang" and
  will rise higher in the BM if you follow this procedure: * Remove a
  cup )or more) of your starter from the fridge and bring to room temp.
  * Feed with 1 cup flour and 1 cup (or slightly less) water * Let the
  starter do its thing. It will become bubbly and foamy. Watch for its
  'peak'. This usually occurs 8 to 10 hours after feeding. It is best
  to keep the starter warm (75 to 85 degrees). If it cold out, leave it
  in the oven with the light turned on! * Make your bread during the
  peak...while the starter is VERY active. * Dump the unused starter
  back into the mother pot. Following this method, you can even make
  sourdough in the b/m without yeast. Really! *Variation: Separate your
  starter into two batches. Create a "beer" starter with one batch. You
  will feed this pot with flat beer and flour instead of water and
  flour. A very unique and delicious taste! * To create your own
  sourdough recipe: Substitute 7/8 cup start for 1 cup liquid Reduce
  flour by 1/4 to 1/2 cup

  fry, cool and freeze. To reheat, preheat oven at 350 degrees. Heat
  frozen packets for 7-8 minutes. COMMENTS: Foil may be substituted if
  parchment paper is unavailable. You may also use cellophane paper,
  and that's quite pretty as the filling shows through clearly. The
  advantage of using the parchment paper is that the chicken pieces
  will not stick to the wrapper. If you prefer to serve fresh, wrap the
  filling several hours ahead and deep-fry at the last minute. Source:

  doesn't hold together sufficiently after chilling, add more matzo
  meal.) Reduce heat to steady slo-boil.  Cover and cook 45 min.,
  spooning ovals with broth after they've cooked for 10 min.  Each pc.
  will puff up and rise to top. Partially uncover and cool in pot for
  30 min. Add reserved carrots to broth. Cover and regrigerate
  overnight; or carefully transfer each pc. to container(s), pouring
  stock over all.  Tightly cover and refrigerate. Broth will thicken

      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Cider vinegar
 
  Serves 8 as a first course. Source: Chef Morey Kanner, Culinary
  Institute of America
  
  To make the poaching liquid: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Combine all
  the poaching liquid ingredients in a large pot. Bring to a gentle
  simmer over medium-low heat. Simmer for 10-15 minutes.
  
  To make the gefilte fish: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Combine all the
  gefilte fish ingredients in a food processor; process for 15 seconds.
  Use a small serving spoon to scrape out a spoonful of the mixture
  against the side of the bowl.
  
  Using another small serving spoon, shape the gefilte fish into a
  dumpling by gently pushing the mixture off the other spoon and
  dropping it gently into the summering poaching liquid. Continue until
  all of the fish mixture has been made into dumplings.
  
  Cook the gefilte fish until all the dumplings float to the liquid's
  surface, about 10-12 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and let the
  dumplings cool in their poaching liquid for 30 minutes at room
  temperature.
  
  Refrigerate until the broth has jelled, about 4 hours or overnight.
  
  Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the dumplings from the jelled
  broth and place on chilled plates. Serve with beet preserves, fresh
  horseradish, julienned green onion and carrot.
  
  BEET PRESERVES:
  
  Combine all of the ingredients in a small pan and simmer gently over
  medium heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until all the liquid has been
  absorbed. Chill well before serving.
  
  Makes 1/2 cup
  
  FRESH HORSERADISH: Prepare at least one day in advance so its flavor
  has time to develop.
  
  Grate the horseradish with the water in a blender until very finely
  shredded. Scrape down the blender's sides with a rubber spatula.
  Strain off any excess liquid and transfer the horseradish to a bowl.
  Add the salt and vinegar; stir to combine. Place in a clean jar,
  cover, and refrigerate overnight. Serve cold.
  
  Makes about 1/2 cup.
  
  Note: To make horseradish in a food processor, fit the processor with
  the fine grating disc. Peel and cut the horseradish so that it will
  fit through the feed tube. Grate the horseradish in the processor and
  transfer it to a bowl. Add the salt and vinegar. The water may be
  omitted using this technique.
  
  Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to three days.

           -Tbsp)
      2    Eggs
           Salt
      4 tb To 5 tb water
           Stuffing:
    500 g  Smoked meat, cooked and
           -diced (a generous lb)
      1    Kaiser-type roll, cubed and
           -sauteed
           Finely chopped onion greens
      1    Pancake, diced
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Egg white (for sealing
           -edges)
 
  Dough:
  
  The liquid the smoked meat has been cooked in makes a suitable broth.
  
  Combine the flour, eggs, salt, and water into a pasta dough. Knead
  well, and immediately roll out thin on a floured pastry board. Cut
  the dough into 5-inch squares.
  
  Make the stuffing by mixing the smoked meat, sauteed cubed roll, onion
  greens, and diced pancake.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Put one
  heaping tablespoon of this stuffing on each square of dough. Brush
  the edges of the dough with egg white, and fold each square over,
  into a triangle. With your fingers, press the edges of the dough
  which should seal immediately. Put the 'Maultaschen' into barely
  cooking salted water, and let them simmer for 5 minutes, turning over
  the pasta once.
  
  Carefully remove 'Maultaschen' from water, as they are very fragile.
  Immediately transfer them to the hot broth, and serve.
  
  Serves 4.

      1 x  Cheesecloth; About 6 ft.
  2 1/2 c  Tomatoes; Canned, Chopped
    1/2 c  Vermouth; Dry
    1/2 c  Beef Broth
      2 tb Tomato Paste
    1/2 ts Sugar
 
  In a medium bowl cover brown rice with hot water and soak for 3 hours.
  Drain.  In a 2-quart saucepan combine rice, 3 cups water, and 1 1/2 t
  salt. Simmer covered for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.
  Add the dillseed, marjoram, and 1/2 t pepper. In a large skillet
  saute 1 1/2 cups chopped onion in 3 T hot vegetable oil until soft,
  about 6 to 8 minutes. Add paprika and garlic, continue cooking and
  stirring for 2 minutes. Stir in the rice mixture, eggs, bread crumbs,
  and parsley. Adjust seasonings to taste.  Core cabbage and, in a
  large pot, blanch the cabbage cored-side-down in boiling salted water
  for 5 minutes or until it is softened.  Drain.  Remove 12 leaves and
  cut off one fourth of each leaf from the base. Arrange 1 leaf
  curved-side down on a square of dampened cheesecloth and place 3 T of
  rice mixture in the center. Wrap the leaf around the filling and
  twist the corners of the cheesecloth to form the leaf into a roll.
  Continue making rolls with remaining filling. Chop remaining cabbage
  to make 3 cups and, in a large frypan, saute with 1 cup chopped
  onions and 2 T vegetable oil until soft. Add tomatoes, vermouth,
  broth, tomato paste, sugar, 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper. Simmer the
  mixture for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasonings.
  Transfer cabbage-tomato sauce mixture to a large baking dish. Arrange
  the cabbage rolls close together in one layer on the sauce. Spoon
  some of the mixture over the rolls. Bake at 325 degrees F for 1 1/2
  hours. Baste rolls 4 to 5 times during cooking.  Let the dish cool.
  Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove cheesecloth. Heat in
  preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes before serving.

           Vegetable Oil
     16 sm Dried Chiles
      1    Garlic Clove, Minced
    1/4 ts Grated Fresh Ginger

    1/4 c  Chicken Broth
    1/4 c  Water
    1/4 c  Dry Sherry Wine
 
  Quoting from the article the recipe was contained in, "The dish is not
  difficult to make and can be prepared partially in advance. The crunch
  texture of the chicken pieces is achieved by coating them with egg and
  cornstarch, then deep-frying them twice; once to cook them through;
  and once at a higher temperature to make them brown and crisp. The
  velvety sweet-sour sauce, which is combined with the chicken at the
  last minute, provides a wonderful counterpoint. The amount of heat is
  your option. Sixteen small dried red peppers provide a moderate
  amount of heat. Add more or less to taste, but be careful not to bite
  into one. They are dynamite!"
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~------------- ~-- Whisk together thoroughly the egg and cornstarch.
  Add pieces of chicken, turning to coat evenly. In wok or deep-fat
  fryer, heat 2 inches of oil to 350=F8F.  Fry chicken, a few pieces at
  a time until lightly browned and just cooked through.  Drain on paper
  towels. Combine sauce ingredients, mixing well. Set aside. (The
  chicken may be fried the first time up to one hour in advance; the
  sauce can be combined several days in advance and kept covered in the
  refrigerator.) In frying pan, heat 1 TB of oil until hot. Add chili
  peppers and cook until blackened. Add onions and stir-fry about one
  minute. Add garlic and ginger, cooking briefly, but do not brown.
  Remove from heat. Reheat deep oil to 400=F8F. Return chicken to fat,
  in batches, and cook until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper
  towels. Re-stir sauce and add to frying pan with onions and peppers.
  Cook, stirring until thickened and bubbly.  Add chicken and cook,
  stirring, until well coated and heated through.  Serve over rice.
  Makes 3 to 4 servings.

      4    Chicken legs, skinned & cut

      2    Egg whites
      2 ts Cornstarch

           -white & green parts)
      1 sm Knob fresh ginger, minced
      1    Garlic clove, minced
      2 ts Sesame oil
 
  Here's a couple of recipes for Gen. Tso's Chicken and a hint on how
  to get pro results.  Can't vouch for them as I've never made the
  dish. These are reposts from other folks.
  
  Vigorously blend egg whites and cornstarch; add chicken pieces and
  toss to coat.  Heat oil in large wok and add chicken pieces in
  batches, cooking each until golden, about 3 minutes, then draining.
  
  Pour off all but 1 TB of hot oil from wok.  Add peppers and stir-fry
  for 15 seconds; add green scallion, minced ginger and garlic and
  stir-fry for 15 more seconds.  Add mixture of vinegar, soy, wine, and
  sugar, stirring until heated through.  Add cornstarch and water
  mixture and stir until mixture is thickened. Off heat, stir in sesame
  oil, garnish with scallion greens, and serve.
  
  NOTE FROM ALAN CLAVER:
  
  Just made my bi-monthly batch of General Tso's Chicken. I've been
  trying for many months to get it to come out just like in my favorite
  Chinese restaurant but couldn't.  Well, I recently read about the
  double frying method of cooking and thought I'd try it - Yippee!
  that's what we missing.
  
  What you do is deep fry the chicken pieces once, then put them aside
  for a bit and reheat the oil.  Then, fry them a second time. This
  really gives them extra crispiness and flavor. You couldn't tell this
  batch from a professional version (umm.. modesty aside 8-)).

      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Soy sauce
 
  For the best results use skinned deboned legs of capon. Cut the
  chicken into pieces no larger than 1 inch square. Prepare marinade by
  combining egg white, cornstarch and 1 tablespoon soy sauce in a large
  bowl. Add chicken pieces and set aside for two hours. In a deep pot,
  heat the oil until it reaches 350 degrees. In a basket, or with a
  slotted spoon, lower several marinated chicken pieces into the fat.
  Fry about one or two minutes or until the chicken becomes crisp; test
  for doneness before completing the batch. Continue until all pieces
  have been fried. Set oil and cooked chicken pieces aside. In a wok,
  on high heat, reheat two tablespoons of the reserved oil. Add
  prepared ginger, scallions, garlic and chili peppers.
  
   Stir to prevent burning. Add the fried chicken and stir quickly.Add
  sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and cornstarch mixed with chicken stock.
  Remove from the heat and stir sesame oil into the sauce. Spoon the
  mixture on to a hot platter and serve immediately with steamed rice.
  Serves 4.

      Title: GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN III
 Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Chinese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Egg
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 lb Boned, skinned chicken
           - (thigh or breast)
           - cut into 2 inch chunks
      4    Green onions
           -cut diagonally into 1" pcs.
           Vegetable oil
     16 sm Dried chilis
      1    Garlic clove; minced
    1/4 ts Grated fresh ginger

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      4 ts Cornstarch
      4 ts Sugar
      4 ts Rice vinegar
      6 tb Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 c  Water
    1/4 c  Dry sherry wine
 
     Quoting from the article the recipe was contained in, "The dish is
  not difficult to make and can be prepared partially in advance. The
  crunch texture of the chicken pieces is achieved by coating them with
  egg and cornstarch, then deep-frying them twice ~ once to cook them
  through and once at a higher temperature to make them brown and
  crisp. The velvety sweet-sour sauce, which is combined with the
  chicken at the last minute, provides a wonderful counterpoint. The
  amount of heat is your option. Sixteen small dried red peppers
  provide a moderate amount of heat. Add more or less to taste, but be
  careful not to bite into one. They are dynamite!"
  
   ****************************************************** **************
     Whisk together thoroughly the egg and cornstarch. Add pieces of
  chicken, turning to coat evenly.  In wok or deep-fat fryer, heat 2
  inches of oil to 350 F.  Fry chicken, a few pieces at a time until
  lightly browned and just cooked through.  Drain on paper towels.
  Combine sauce ingredients, mixing well.  Set aside. (The chicken may
  be fried the first time up to one hour in advance; the sauce can be
  combined several days in advance and kept covered in the
  refrigerator.)
     In frying pan, heat 1 TBSP of oil until hot.  Add chili peppers
  and cook until blackened.  Add onions and stir-fry about one minute.
  Add garlic and ginger, cooking briefly, but do not brown. Remove from
  heat.
     Reheat deep oil to 400 F.  Return chicken to fat, in batches, and
  cook until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
     Re-stir sauce and add to frying pan with onions and peppers. Cook,
  stirring until thickened and bubbly. Add chicken and cook, stirring,
  until well coated and heated through. Serve over rice.
  
  Makes 3 to 4 servings.

      Title: GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN WITH ORANGE
 Categories: Chinese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Boneless chicken breast
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
      2 ts Rice wine
           -or dry sherry
      1 ts Ginger root; minced
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/3 c  Peanut oil
      2    Dried red chiles
           - halve lengthwise
      1 tb Orange peel; coarse chop
    1/2 ts Fine ground roasted sichuan
           -peppercorns (optional)
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
 
  This popular dish gets a lift from the addition of orange peel, hence
  its other name, Orange Peel Chicken.
  
  CUT CHICKEN INTO THIN SLICES 2 inches long, cutting against the
  grain. Put it into a bowl together with the soy sauce, rice wine or
  sherry, ginger, cornstarch and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Mix well, and
  then let the mixture marinate for about 20 minutes. Heat the oil in a
  wok or large skillet until it is very hot. Remove the chicken from
  the marinade with a slotted spoon. Add it to the pan and stir-fry it
  for 2 minutes until it browns. Remove it and leave to drain in a
  colander or sieve. Pour off most of the oil, leaving about 2
  teaspoons. Reheat the pan over a high heat and then add the dried
  chiles. Stir-fry them for 10 seconds, and then return the chicken to
  the pan. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir-fry for 4 minutes,
  mixing well. Serve the dish at once.

      Title: GENERAL WOK COOKING INSTRUCTIONS
 Categories: Info/tips, Wok
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  (1) Always check to see if you have all the ingredients on hand before
  preparing meals.
  
  (2) Cut up your meat and vegetables, marinating any that require this
  process. Set aside for cooking, if you are cooking several wok dishes
  at the same meal, prepare all of them before cooking any.
  
  (3) Place oil in wok, heat until oil just begins to smoke.
  
  (4) Stir fry your meat, onions, or garlic together. Then add other
  ingredients accordingly.
  
  (5) If a gravy is desired, use a little corn starch (about 1
  tablespoon) dissolved in 1/3 cup of water. Stir this mixture
  vigorously and pour into your wok on top of your cooked food. Mix
  thoroughly. Your gravy should be just the right consistency. In case
  it is too thick, add hot water a tablespoon at a time to thin gravy
  out. If the gravy is too thin, mix up more corn starch solution and
  repeat process.
  
  (6) If you are cooking several wok dishes at the same meal, and are
  worried about keeping them all warm, heat your oven up to 150'C. and
  store cooked dishes in it until eating time. Maximum storage time is
  about one hour. DO NOT store cooked leaft green vegetables in this
  manner as they will turn yellow. Instead, leave those in an uncovered
  wok and reheat at meal time. If you have an electric hot tray, it is
  excellent for keeping dishes warm.

      Title: GENERIC IMPOSSIBLE PIE
 Categories: Casseroles
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  1 1/3 c  Milk
      4    Eggs
    5/8 c  Bisquick
    1/2 ts Garlic salt
    1/4 ts Pepper, black
      1 ts Herbs

MMMMM-----------------------THINGS TO ADD----------------------------
      1 c  Meat, cooked; chopped
  1 1/2 c  Vegetables; bite-sized
      1 c  Mushrooms; pieces
      6    Onions, green; thinly sliced
    1/2    Onions; chopped or rings
      2    Bell peppers; rings/chopped
      1 c  Cheese, shredded
 
  Meat can be chicken, turkey, beef, ham, or even bacon. Vegetables can
  be anything your family likes and you have in the freezer or garden:
  green beans, corn, carrots, peas. If you use a watery vegetable such
  as tomatoes or zucchini, be sure to drain well. Cheese can be
  whatever will go well with the meat: ham and swiss, beef and cheddar,
  chicken and monterey jack, garden vegetables and parmesan, shrimp or
  crabmeat and almost anything. For a vegetable quiche, just use
  vegetables and more cheese.
  
  Preheat oven to 400.  Thaw and drain vegetables. Spray one foil pie
  plate per 2 servings with nonstick spray. Mix meat, vegetables, and
  cheese in pie plate. (If desired, reserve 1/8 c cheese per pie plate
  to sprinkle on top for last 5 minutes of baking.)  Beat filling
  ingredients until smooth (15 seconds in blender). Pour into plate(s).
  Bake 20 minutes. Cool 5 minutes.
  
  Sylvia's comments: this is a wonderful, flexible dinner pie. Great for
  whatever leftovers you need to use up. I don't care what anyone says,
  you can't fit 8 servings' worth into one pie plate.

      Title: GENERIC QUICHE (BAR CODE GOES HERE)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Grated Cheese
      1 c  Half & Half
      4 lg Eggs
      1    Unbaked Pie Shell
      1 c  Filling
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Herbs (your choice)
    1/8 ts Black pepper
 
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Beat the eggs.  Brush pie shell with beaten
  egg and pre-bake for 5 minutes. Allow to cool for a couple of
  minutes. Combine cheese and filling material and place in pie shell.
  Dust with salt, pepper and herbs. Combine half & half and eggs and
  pour over all. Leave a little room for expansion. Bake 30-40 minutes
  (golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean).
  Allow to rest for about 10 minutes before serving. It is a good idea
  to place your pie pans on a cookie sheet just in case this boils over.
  
  Re:  measurements.  Since you generally buy a dozen eggs, frozen pie
  shells come two to a pack, half and half is sold in Pints and it is
  easy to buy a big enough brick of cheese, I usually double this and
  make two quiches. They freeze well and make great leftovers and are a
  wonderful breakfast.
  
  Re:  fillings ... anything you want.  Suggest spinach, chopped
  brocoli, onion, green pepper, crab, shrimp, sausage, bacon, ham,
  turkey, etc.

      Title: GENOISE
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6    Eggs, at room temperature or
           -warmer
      1 c  Extra-fine granulated sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Cake flour; sifted
    1/4 c  Butter
 
  Recipe by: The New York Times Cookbook 1. Warm the bowl of an electric
  mixer.  Beat the eggs with the sugar and vanilla at the highest speed
  until the mixture stands in stiff peaks when the beater is withdrawn.
  Depending on the power of the mixer, this should take from 5 to 30
  minutes. It is important not to underbeat the mixture. Scrape the
  sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula from time to time so the
  ingredients will be well blended.
  
  2.  Meanwhile grease two 9-inch or three 8-inch cake pans that are 1
  1/2 inches deep.  Line the pans with waxed paper and grease the
  paper. Melt the butter and let cool to luke warm. Set the oven
  temperature at moderate 350F and place the rack in the lower third of

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
 
  Text only: "Melt 1/2 pound of butter and mix with as much Hot Tabasco
  sauce as you can stand. For super hot, add the whole bottle (now,
  that can get really hot depending on the size of the bottle you buy!).
  
  Salt and pepper to taste, usually fairly heavy on the salt (keeps you
  eating the wings, like popcorn despite the fire coming out of your
  nostrils!)
  
  Don't forget celery and blue cheese dressing to cool down the insides
  of your mouth enough to go back and have some more!
  
  A trick I like... coat your wings in this mixture, and then deep fry
  them, and then coat again when done. Makes the wings nice and crispy!"

 Categories: Cyberealm, Fish
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
           Text only
 
  "If you like seafood, try this sometime. It's a fillet from the Monk
  Fish, and is usually available at most fresh seafood counters. The
  meat is translucent pink, with a darker purple membrane on one side.
  Cut off that membrane, and discard. Then cut the fillet into 1 1/2 to
  2 inch chunks. Bring a pan of water to a boil and drop the chunks
  into it. Count to 10 then spoon back out. The meat will double in
  size and be a nice white color. Place chunks on a broiling pan and
  baste with melted butter (add lemon and/or garlic if desired). Broil
  on each side for about 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Cut into
  fork-sized pieces and dip into melted butter, just as you would
  lobster. A little milder flavor, but definitely is a good substitute,
  at a much cheaper price! Cook some cube steaks with this meal and
  call it Poor Man's Surf and Turf!"

  reserve. 3. Meal the oil in a large heavy pot. Add the onions and
  cook until they are translucent. 4. Meanwhile, drain the beef,
  straining and reserving the marinade. Mix the beef and pork together,
  then combine the meats with the ground chile, cayenne pepper,
  oregano, cumin, rosemary, and the rest of the salt. Add this
  meat-and-spice mixture to the pot with the onions. Break up any lumps
  with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is evenly
  browned. 5. Add half the marinade, the reserved chicken, tomatoes,
  both tomato sauces, jalapenos, and 1 tablespoon of liquid hot pepper
  sauce to the pot. 6. Melt the butter in a heavy skillet over medium
  heat. Add the fresh chiles, mushrooms, and a small amount of the
  Sauterne and cook for 3 minutes. Add this to the pot. 7. Bring to a
  boil and simmer, uncovered, for at least 3 hours. When the chili is
  cooking, from time to time stir in the remaining marinade, the
  remaining Sauterne, and beer. If more liquid is needed, stir in the
  water the chicken was cooked in. Taste and adjust seasonings.

    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg

MMMMM-----------------------CRUMB TOPPING----------------------------
    1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      6 tb Light brown sugar
      4 tb Unsalted butter; chilled
    1/4 ts Cinnamon

MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      6 tb Sour cream
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 lg Egg
    1/3 c  Sugar
      4 tb Unsalted butter; softened
  1 1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
    3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 375~, 15 minutes before baking, with the rack in the
  center of the oven. Butter an 8" square baking pan, preferably glass.
  Cut the peaches into 1/2" slices. Put in a pan with sugar, lemon
  juice, tapioca and nutmeg and toss gently. Cook over high heat until
  syrup begins to bubble, about 4 minutes. Set aside.
    FOR THE TOPPING: Work the flour into the sugar, butter and cinnamon
  until the butter is the size of small peas. This can be done with a
  food processor or pastry blender. Set aside.
   FOR THE CAKE: Stir the sour cream and baking soda together and let
  stand while you begin the cake. Cream the egg, sugar and butter in
  the processor or with a mixer until it is light and fluffy. Add the
  vanilla and sour cream and mix well. Gently fold in the flour, baking

 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 lb Ripe peaches; peeled
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg

MMMMM-----------------------CRUMB TOPPING----------------------------
    1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      6 tb Light brown sugar
      4 tb Unsalted butter; chilled
    1/4 ts Cinnamon

MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      6 tb Sour cream
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 lg Egg
    1/3 c  Sugar
      4 tb Unsalted butter; softened
  1 1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
    3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F 15 minutes before baking, with the rack in the
  center of the oven. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan, preferably
  glass. Cut the peaches into 1/2-inch slices. Put in a pan with sugar,
  lemon juice, tapioca and nutmeg and toss gently. Cook over high heat
  until syrup begins to bubble, about 4 minutes. Set aside. FOR THE
  TOPPING: Work the flour into the sugar, butter and cinnamon until the
  butter is the size of small peas. This can be done with a food
  processor or pastry blender. Set aside. FOR THE CAKE: Stir the sour
  cream and baking soda together and let stand while you begin the
  cake. Cream the egg, sugar and butter in the processor or with a
  mixer until it is light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and sour cream
  and mix well. Gently fold in the flour, baking powder and salt. In
  the processor, do this by pulsing the machine on and off several
  times. Spread the warm peaches and their juice in the bottom of the
  baking pan. Spoon the batter over the peaches and spread in a thin,
  even layer with a rubber spatula. It's OK if the peaches are not
  completely covered. Sprinkle the topping over the batter. Bake until
  a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake--not the

      Title: GEORGIAN (RUSSIA) GARLIC SALAD (AKA MARINATED
 Categories: Salad/dress, Vegetables, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     50    To 75 cloves of garlic,
           Peeled
      1 c  Extra virgin olive oil
    1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice (or
           Balsamic vinegar)
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Freshly ground or cracked
           Black pepper
      1 tb Herbs (oregano is nice, or
           Create your own mixture)
 
  Start by peeling all that garlic.  Now bring a saucepan of water to
  boil. Once the water is boiling, turn off heat and drop garlic cloves
  into hot water. Let sit in water for 3 to 5 minutes. (Use the shorter
  time if you like a sharper raw garlic flavor; the longer time results
  in a much milder garlic flavor.) Remove garlic and plunge into (or
  rinse thoroughly with) cold water to stop the cloves from "cooking"
  any further.
  
  Dissolve the salt into the lemon juice. Now make a "viniagrette" with
  the olive oil, lemon juice/salt, pepper and herbs. Place garlic into
  jars and pour oil mixture to top the cloves. Refrigerate for a
  minimum of 1 week.
  
  After one week, eat straight (or, for the faint of heart, slice up
  garlic and mix with your salad greens). Be sure to keep refrigerated.
  I don't know how long this will last in the refrigerator because I
  eat it up too fast.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 pk Dry yeast
           Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Lukewarm milk
           Flour
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Butter, softened

MMMMM-----------------------CHEESE FILLING----------------------------
      1 lb Muenster Cheese
      2 tb Butter
      1    Egg, beaten
 
  Sprinkle yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar over milk in small shallow bowl.
  Cover with plastic wrap and place in warm place until yeast blooms and
  mixture nearly doubles in vol- ume, 5 to 10 minutes. Combine 4 1/2
  cups flour, 1 tablespoon sugar and salt in large mixing bowl. Make
  well in flour mixture and add milk-yeast mixture and softened butter.
  Beat vigorously with large spoon until smooth.  Form into ball and
  place on lightly floured surface.  Knead hard 10 minutes, adding more
  flour or water as needed to create medium stiff dough. When dough is
  smooth and elastic, place in large, lightly buttered bowl. Cover with
  plastic wrap and kitchen towel and let rise in warm, draft-free
  place, such as unlit oven with pilot light on, until doubled in bulk
  and dough springs back slowly when gently poked with finger, 45
  minutes to 1 hour. Punch dough down and let rise until again doubled,
  30 to 40 minutes. Punch dough down and roll out on lightly floured
  surface into circle about 22 inches in diameter. If rolling surface
  is too small, divide dough in half and roll into 2 half-circles 22 by
  11 inches. Roll dough up on rolling pin and unroll carefully over
  buttered 9-inch cake or springform pan or springform so that it is
  centered, with edges overlapping more or less evenly on all sides. If
  using 2 half circles of dough, form 1-inch seam to make whole circle
  and moisten thoroughly to seal. Carefully press center of dough down
  to bottom of pan. Place cheese filling on dough and bring up edges of
  dough over filling, forming thick, fabriclike folds. Moisten edges at
  top and seal. Let stand 10 to 15 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees in
  center of oven, on foil in case filling leaks, until golden brown, 50
  minutes to 1 hour. Cool 1 to 2 hours before serving. Makes 12 to 16
  servings.
                   Cheese Filling In large mixing bowl, combine cheese,
  butter, and egg. Knead vigorously until mixture is uniform. Shape into
  thick, round cake 8 to 7 1/2 inches in diameter.

  One of
  :         the most typical sauces is tkemali, which is made with a
  base of
  :         wild or sour plums that grow only in the Georgian republic.
  It

      Title: GERMAN EGG DUMPLINGS WITH CHERVIL
 Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, German, Side dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
      3 lg Eggs; beaten lightly
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 ds Grated nutmeg
      1 tb Minced chervil or
      1 tb Italian flat-leaved parsley
           -- minced
    1/2 c  Milk or water
           -- or more as needed
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter
 
  In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except butter, adding
  enough liquid so that batter is the consistency of a thick crepe
  batter. With a wooden spoon or spatula, beat batter in a circular
  motion, to incorporate as much air as possible into the dough (about
  5 minutes). Allow dough to rest 10 minutes, then beat again another 5
  minutes.
  
  Bring lightly salted water (or stock) to a boil.  Turn heat down so
  water just simmers.  Using a large-holed colander, vegetable mill,
  spatzle cutter or a pastry bag, drop small bits of dough into
  simmering liquid. (If using colander, press batter through holes.
  With pastry bag, break off small bits with a knife; or place a flat,
  large-holed cheese grater over top of pot and press batter through
  the openings with a spatula.) When cooked, spatzle will rise to the
  surface (about 5 minutes).
  
  Remove with a slotted spoon, rinse under cold water and drain well.
  (To keep ahead of time, place spatzle on a damp towel and
  refrigerate, up to a day or two.)
  
  To reheat, place butter on a large baking pan and place in moderate
  oven to melt butter.  Spread spatzle on pan and toss to coat with
  butter. Heat, uncovered, in 350 F. oven until golden brown and
  slightly crisp. Or saute in butter.
  
  Good served with veal or pork chops and sour cream gravy.

      Title: GERMAN FRIENDSHIP CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Sourdough, German
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      1 c  Cake starter

MMMMM------------------------STARTER FOOD-----------------------------
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Flour, self-raising
      1 c  Sugar

MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      2 c  Flour, self-raising
      1 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Oil
      2 ts Cinnamon
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Nuts (or other fruits)
     15 oz Pineapple chunks,
           -drained (one can)
 
  PREPARE STARTER:
  
  Day 1:  Blend the starter feed together, and then hand mix in the
  starter. I find it easiest to mix the flour and sugar together dry,
  add the milk to the starter, and then slowly add the flour and sugar
  to the liquid. The starter should never be beaten with a blender or
  refrigerated. Pour the mixture into a large bowl, cover with
  cling-film or a damp towel, and leave to brew.
  
  Day 2:  Thoroughly mix the sourdough, then leave to brew again.
  
  Day 5:  As day 1
  
  Day 6:  As day 2
  
  Day 10:  Print off three copies of this recipe.  Here now is why this
  is called a friendship cake.  Take 3 cups of Sourdough mixture, and
  give them away with copies of the recipe as starters to your friends.
  Then proceed with the baking.
  
  MAKING THE CAKE:  Blend all ingredients thoroughly with remaining
  starter. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Pour mixture into a
  well-greased baking tin. Bake for 1 3/4 hours (less in a fan oven),
  cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A 10-day Sourdough cake -- This is known as the friendship cake,
  it's a bit like a chain letter in that you have to find a set of
  friends to pass on the starter to.
  
  During preparation put the starter into a very large bowl (it foams
  up), and cover with a lid or with cling film. Yield: Starter and one
  cake.
  
  *  If you don't get cake starter from a friend, you can probably buy
  it in a baking supply store.
  
  *  Vary the spices to taste.  The cake is quite pleasant if you forget
  them.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 days brewing starter, 30 minutes preparing cake, 2 hours
  baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: GERMAN PANCAKES
 Categories: Pancakes, German, Breakfast
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    Eggs
      1 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      3 ts Sugar
  1 1/3 c  Milk
      1 c  Butter (2 sticks)
 
  Cinnamon sugar Juice of 1 lemon jam...suggested are loganberry,
  boysenberry or seedless raspberry
  
  You will need a LARGE skillet for these...
  
  Beat the eggs until light and frothy.  Add flour, salt, sugar and
  milk. Beat for 5 minutes more.  The batter will be thin, but very
  smooth and creamy.
  
  Place 2 T of butter into the pan for each pancake. Heat until pan is
  very hot, but don't allow butter to burn. Ladle in enough batter with
  one hand so that, with the other hand holding the skillet handle and
  rotating the skillet, there is just enough batter to cover the bottom
  and slightly up the sides of thepan, but not a lot of excess. This
  will produce a giant, crepelike pancake.
  
  Check the cake by gently lifting the edge with a spatula. When it is
  nicely browned, tunr the cake. The second side will brown quickly.
  
  Place the pancake onto a warm plate, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar then
  lemon juice, then spread with jam. Roll up like a small jellyroll,
  sprinle again with cinnamon sugar, cut into two pieces, and serve.

      Title: GERMAN PEPPERED BEEF SOUP
 Categories: Soups, German
      Yield: 2 Gallons
 
      5 lb German peppered beef *
      2 lg Yellow onions diced large
      1 c  Crushed RED BELL peppers **
      2 lb Red potatoes
      2 lg Carrots
      2 ea Celery stocks (not bunches)
    1/4 c  Oregeno
    1/4 c  Sweet basil
      1 tb Celery seed
    1/8 c  Carroway seed
    1/2 c  Dill weed
 
  * this may be obtained from all of the german deli's I have ever been
  in (which may not be many)... and is basically a rather tough cut of
  beef which has been covered (and I do mean covered) with very large
  chunks of black pepper corns (some are even whole) ** if you can not
  find red bell peppers dried and crushed you will want to do it your
  self for the flavor needed... cut three or four red bell peppers into
  small pieces and spread out on paper towels to dry (or put it in your
  food drier if you have one) seeds and all! FIRST: cut the meat into 1
  inch chunks (leaving the precious pepper on it!), sear by your
  favorite method... I prefer a small amount of sesame oil in a wok.
  CROCK POT METHOD: chop everything up into 1 inch chunks throw in the
  pot, set on medium (200 degrees), cover with water plus 1 inch (for
  the pan as my mentor said), cook covered (with a lid) stirring every
  2 hours or so from the bottom for 4 hours, turn to low, cook covered
  for 6 hours. PAN METHOD: chop everything into 1 inch chunks, place
  carrots, celery, and meat into pan, cook 1 hour at med/low (150 to
  160 degrees), add the rest of the goodies, cook 1 hour. Ahh a bug
  found... covered in water both times, better go change it <GRIN> plus
  1 inch for the pan LAST: refrigerate for at least 6 hours, warm only
  as much as you will be eating. NOTES: you are correct, this method
  looks a little "ugly", but having been taught to make this soup by a
  german grandmother, and her scottish husband (my grand father, who
  also was a chef by trade)... I learned at a very young age that what
  they said usualy worked the best, even though it took more time.

  pieces. Shape each into a smooth ball by gently kneading. Then roll
  each into a smooth rope about 18 inches long, and twist into a
  pretzel shape. Place slightly apart on a greased baking sheet turning
  loose ends underneath. Let rise, uncovered,until puffy(about 25
  minutes) Meanwhile, in a 3-quart stainless steel or enameled pan(not
  aluminum) bring soda water to a boil; adjust water to keep water
  boiling gently. With a slotted spatula, lower 1 pretzel at a time
  into pan. Let simmer for 10 seconds on each side,then lift from
  water,drain briefly on spatula, and return to baking sheet. Let dry
  briefly, then sprinkle with coarse salt and let stand,uncovered,
  until all have simmered.

    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Eggs
      1 tb Orange peel, finely shredded
      2 ts Lemon peel, finely shredded
    1/2 c  Almonds, blanched chopped
           Confectioners' glaze **
 
   * Candied citron or citrus peel, diced ** Confectioners' glaze or
  powdered sugar ~ In a medium bowl combine raisins, cherries,
  currants, citron or citrus peel, and rum.  Set aside.  In a large
  mixer bowl combine 1-1/2 cups of the flour and yeast.  Heat milk,
  butter, sugar and salt over low heat, stirring constantly until warm
  (120F to 130F). Add to dry ingredients along with eggs and fruit
  peels.  Beat at low speed of electric mixer for 1/2 minute, scraping
  sides of bowl. Beat 3 minutes at high speed. Stir in fruit-rum
  mixture, almonds and enough of the remaining flour to make a soft
  dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead in enough of
  the remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth
  and elastic (5 to 6 minutes). Shape into a ball. Place in a greased
  bowl, turning once. Cover. Let rise until double (1 hour). Punch
  dough down. Divide in half. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.
  
  On a lightly floured surface roll each half to a 10x8-inch oval. Fold
  lengthwise in half so the top half overlaps to within 1/2 inch of the
  bottom half. Press folded edge firmly. Place about 4-inches apart on
  greased baking sheet.  Cover and let rise until double (45 minutes).
  Bake in a 375F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool.
  
  Serve sprinkled with powdered sugar or spread with Confectioners'
  Glaze and decorate with candied cherries. Makes 2 loaves.

    Mix 1 cup sifted powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon milk. Add more
  milk, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until spreading consistency.
