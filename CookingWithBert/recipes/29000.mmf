 Categories: Jane, Rubey
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Potatoes -- red skin
           Preferred
     12    Cloves garlic -- peeled
      2 ts Extra virgin olive oil
    1/4 c  Dry wine -- red or white
      1 ts Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      6    Sprigs fresh rosemary --
      6    Inch
 
  Counts: about 18 small potatoes. Scrub the potatoes. With the skins
  on, cut small potatoes so pieces are no larger than 1-inch in
  thickness. Place in a large bowl with the rest of the ingredients.
  Toss to mix well. Cut 2 sheets of microwave wrap (or parchment) 12 X
  18-inches. Also cut 2 sheets of aluminum foil 12 X 18-inches. Lay one
  sheet of parchment on top of one sheet of foil; repeat, making 2
  wraps. Divide potato garlic mixture, including all of the liquid and
  seasoning, onto the 2 wraps. Top with rosemary sprigs. Bring 12-inch
  edges of one packet together. Seal open edges tightly by turning or
  rolling and pressing them together. Repeat for second packet. Flatten
  so potato pieces are in a single layer. Place packets on hot grill
  and cook, turning once, until potatoes yield when pressed with
  finger, about 15 minutes on each side. Just prior to serving, unwrap
  packet and turn potatoes and garlic onto warm platter. Discard
  rosemary stems. Smash vegetables coarsely with potato masher or large
  fork. Top with fish and relish. Serve immediately.

  NOTES : These could be baked in a hot (425F) oven for about 25
  minutes. In this case you could leave off the foil; just be sure the
  parchment is well sealed. When grilled, the foil prevents the
  parchment from burning; the parchment prevents the acidic wine from
  eating through the foil. I find that microwave wrap can be
  substituted for parchment. It is available at the supermarket and is
  much less expensive. Recipe By : Jane Rubey, 1996, Deliciously

      Title: GRILLED STUFFED FRESH PASILLA CHILE WITH AVOC
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      6    Fresh pasilla (poblano)
           -chiles, Anaheims or
           -pimientos
    1/2 c  Grated fontina cheese
    1/2 c  Grated Monterey Jack cheese
    1/2 c  Grated Jarisberg cheese
      1 c  Grated white cheddar cheese
    1/2 c  Grated Asiago or Parmesan
           -cheese
     12    Cilantro sprigs
           AVOCADO SALSA:
      2    Ripe avocados
    1/2    To 1 jalapeno chile,
           -roasted, seeded and minced
    1/2 sm Red onion, minced
      3    Scallions, minced (white
           -part and 2 inches of green)
      3 tb Roughly chopped cilantro
      2 tb Rice vinegar
      6 tb Olive oil
           Kosher or sea salt
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Prepare the chiles by cutting all the way around the stem so that you
  can remove the stem and seed base in 1 piece. Keeping the stem and
  top intact, trim off any seeds and membranes, and if any get left
  behind in the pepper, remove them, too. Blanch the chiles for 2
  minutes in lightly salted boiling water. Remove the chiles, refresh
  in ice water, and drain.
  
  Combine the grated cheeses in a bowl and mix well. Stuff each chile
  with about 1/2 cup of the cheese mixture. Do not overstuff or pack
  the cheese in too densely. Replace the stem and top of the chile.
  
  Cook on a grill over a medium fire, turning frequently until the
  cheeses are melted and the chiles are hot all the way through.
  
  Avocado Salsa: Cut each avocado in half. Remove the seed, make
  dice-sized crisscrosses in the avocado flesh with a knife, and scoop
  out the dice with a spoon. Place in a mixing bowl and add the chile,
  onion, scallions and chopped cilantro. Whisk together the vinegar and
  oil in a separate bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and pour over
  the avocado mixture. Mix gently, being careful not to mash the
  avocado or the salsa will look like guacamole and taste "muddy."
  
  Place on a bed of Avocado Salsa and garnish with the cilantro sprigs.

  Combine balsamic vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan over high heat.
  Simmer mixture until it is thick and syrupy, or reduced by one-half,
  about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter and cool.
  
  If using grill, heat grill to high. Cut sweet potatoes crosswise into
  1/2-inch-thick slices. Brush tops of slices with oil and place,
  brushed side down, on grill until marked, about 2 minutes. While
  slices are cooking, brush the other sides with remaining oil and turn
  over. Grill until marked, about 2 more minutes. Brush grilled sweet
  potatoes on both sides with vinegar glaze and serve.
  
  If using broiler, heat broiler to high. Arrange sweet potatoe slices
  on a baking sheet and brush tops with glaze; no oil is necessary.
  Place baking sheet under broiler and broil until glaze starts to
  bubble, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from oven, turn potatoes over, and
  brush with glaze. Broil for 3 to 4 more minutes.

           VEGETABLE MINESTRONE:
      1 tb Olive oil
      1    Clove garlic, pressed or
           Minced
      2 c  Finely diced vegetables
           (such as yellow squash,
           Zucchini, onion, red bell
           Pepper)
  1 1/2 tb Chopped fresh basil leaves
      1 ts Chopped fresh thyme leaves
      1 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
           Leaves
      1    11.5 oz can V-8 juice
    1/4 c  Fat-free chicken stock
    1/4 ts White pepper
           HERBED COUSCOUS:
  1 1/2 c  Fat-free chicken stock
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Chopped fresh thyme leaves
    1/2 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
           Leaves
      1 ts Olive oil
      1 c  Couscous
           SWORDFISH:
  1 1/2 lb Fresh swordfish (4 6-oz
           Pieces)
           Sprigs of fresh thyme or
           Rosemary, for garnish (opt.)
 
  To make the vegetable minestrone, heat the oil in a large saucepan
  over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook just until it starts to
  sizzle; do not brown. Add the herbs, juice, stock and peper and bring
  to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes. Set aside.
  
  To make the couscous, combine the stock, pepper, herbs and oil in a
  small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the couscous, mix well and
  remove from the heat. Cover tightly and allow to stand for at least 5
  minutes, or until all of the liquid has been absorbed. Set aside.
  
  Wash the swordfish and pat it dry.  Rub the surface with a little
  olive oil and sprinkle with salt, freshly ground black pepper and
  herbs, if desired. Cook over a charcoal grill or under a broiler just
  until it turns from translucent to opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes per
  side. Do not overcook or the fish will become tough.
  
  To serve, place a rounded 1/2 cup of couscous on each of 4 plates and
  top with a piece of grilled swordfish. Spoon the minestrone around
  each serving, dividing it equally. Garnish each serving with a sprig
  of fresh thyme or rosemary, if desired.

  over the sink. Arrange tofu in one layer on the cutting board, then
  top with a clean dishtowel. Place a second board on top, then a 4 to
  5 pound weight, such as a thick phone book or heavy pot. Let press 20
  minutes.
  
  Uncover tofu and place in one layer in a shallow baking dish. Drizzle
  with orange juice and soy sauce. Marinate at room temperature 20
  minutes.
  
  Broil or grill over hot coals until lightly browned, turning once.
  Serve with Cold and Spicy Noodles.

      Title: GRILLED TOFU SANDWICHES
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    1-in slabs marinated tofu
      4 sl White or whole wheat bread
           Mayonnaise
           Horseradish to taste
      1 lg Tomato, sliced
           Salt and pepper
           Lettuce
           Thinly sliced red onions
           - (optional)
 
  Be sure to use the firm, Chinese-style tofu rather than the soft or
  regular tofu. It tastes best after it has been marinated for several
  days. PREPARE A FIRE if you are grilling the tofu, and grill it on
  both sides, about 6 inches above the coals, until it is well-browned
  and a little crispy. Otherwise, broil the tofu on both sides. Spread
  the bread with mayonnaise and horseradish to taste. Slice the tofu in
  half, crosswise, to make pieces 1/2-inch thick, and cut the pieces to
  fit the bread. Arrange the tomato slices on the tofu, and salt and
  pepper them; add the onion if you wish. Cover with the lettuce and
  the top piece of bread.

 Categories: Bbq, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------NORMA WRENN MSN---------------------------
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice or wine
           Vinegar
      2 tb Fresh basil; chopped
      1 tb Shallots; chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      3 lg Tomatoes; cut into slices
           -1/2-3/4 inch thick
     10    To 12 green onions; trimmed
           Including 4" of green tops
           Sprigs of fresh basil or
           Parsley
 
  Firm tomatoes, even those that are slightly green, should be used for
  this recipe.  They are less juice and hold their shape better when
  grilled than fully ripe ones. Fresh basil is wonderful with tomatoes,
  but you could also use chopped tarragon or even parsley in the
  basting sauce. Serve warm or at room temperature, with grilled lamb
  or fish.
  
  Prepare a fire in a grill.  Position the oiled grill rack 4-6 inches
  above the fire.
  
  In a small bowl stir together the oil, lemon juice or vinegar, chopped
  basil, shallots, salt and pepper.
  
  Arrange the tomatoes and onions on the rack. Grill, turning them two
  or three times and brushing with the oil mixture, about 5 minutes. If
  the onions are large, they might take 1 or 2 minutes longer.
  
  Transfer the tomatoes and onions to a platter and garnish with basil
  or parsley sprigs.

      3    Cloves garlic; crushed
      1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; sliced
    1/2 c  Red wine
 
  Place the tournedos side by side in a shallow pan and sprinkle them
  with salt and pepper.  Mix 2 tablespoons olive oil with the lemon,
  garlic, and onion.  Rub the mixture into the tournedos. Set them
  aside on a plate to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.
  
  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over
  high heat.  Remove the tournedos from the marinade and reserve it.
  With a paper towel, wipe or blot the tournedos and add them to the
  pan. Cook them to the preferred degree of doneness (about 8 minutes
  for rare, 10 to 12 minutes for medium).  Remove them to a lightly
  heated platter and keep them warm.
  
  Add the marinade, mushrooms, and onions to the skillet and stir-fry
  until the onions and mushrooms are lightly browned. Add the red wine.
  Raise the heat to high to burn off the alcohol quickly. Cook until
  the sauce reduces to a slightly creamy consistency, then spoon it
  over the reserved tournedos.  Source:  Monday Night at Narsai's.

      Title: GRILLED TUNA FISH WITH AVOCADO & TOMATO SAL
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     10    Cherry tomatoes
      1    Red pepper
      1    Green chilli (or to taste)
      1    Ripe, firm avocado
           Olive oil
           Salt and pepper
      4    Tuna steaks, cut from the
           -belly
      2 tb Chopped chives
      1 tb Coriander leaves
      2    Lemons or limes
 
  Roughly chop the tomatoes, pepper and chilli and place in a bowl. Cut
  the avocado in half and, with your hand wrapped in a tea towel for
  protection, hold the half with the stone in it. Lightly tap the stone
  with a sharp knife so that the blade lodges in the stone. Twist the
  knife and the stone should come away easily. Slice the flesh from
  both halves into chunks and add to the chopped ingredients. Pour over
  a generous amount of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and set
  aside.
  
  Grill the tuna steaks for two minutes on each side, or longer if you
  don't want them too underdone. Remember that the fish will continue
  cooking a little even when you remove it from the heat. Season with
  salt and pepper on both sides and allow to rest in a warm oven.
  
  To serve, divide the salsa equally on four plates, place the tuna
  steaks on top, sprinkle with the chives and coriander and serve with
  half a lemon or lime.

      4    Tuna steak, 1" thick
           -(about 8 ounces each)
           Rosemary sprig, fresh; (opt)
 
  Blend butter, olives, 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon rosemary
  and mustard in small bowl.  (Butter can be prepared up to 2 days
  ahead. Wrap tightly and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 45
  minutes before continuing.)
  
  Whisk olive oil with remaining 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice,
  remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary and pepper in shallow dish. Arrange
  tuna steaks in dish, turning to caot both sides. Let stand 15 minutes.
  
  Prepare barbecue (high heat).  Grill tuna until just cooked through,
  about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to platter. Place 1 tablespoon
  rosemary butter on each steak. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.
  
  Note from author:  A simple, sunny dish with the flavors of the south
  of France.  The seasoned butter is our bonus, since the fish is
  already delicious after its quick marinating in a rosemary
  vinaigrette. Add a sliced tomato salad and buttered orzo (rice-shaped
  pasta) for a satisfying meal.  Finish with freshing lemon sorbet.

      Title: GRILLED TURKEY
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -==============
 
  On a large Webers (round, covered, charcoal grill):
  
  Picking the turkey:
  
  Get a flat one otherwise the top of the turkey sticks to the
  underside of the cover.  This is only a problem with the 14+ lb. size
  turkeys. Make sure it is not selfbasting. Fresh is best.
  
  Get the charcoal to the greying over stage, shift half the coals to
  one side, the other half to the other side, put a foal drip pan down
  the center (you can use drippings in this pan for the gravy, but a
  lot will burn away).
  
  Do NOT stuff the turkey other than a few onions or garlics. (I forget
  why, but it is important not to do so). Slather the turkey up with
  vegetable oil and season (salt/pepper). Loosely truss up the legs.
  Put on a poultry rack.
  
  Put the turkey in the rack in the center of the grill over the drip
  pan. Cover the grill.  Add 23 coals per side every half hour. Cook
  1113 minutes per pound (eg. 132156 minutes for a 12 pound turkey).
  
  You can add wood chips for smoked flavor if desired to the coals just
  before you put the turkey in.  Add more as time goes on.
  
  The turkey meat comes out absolutely moist as moist can be, even the
  white meat.  You may want to foil protect the wings if they start to
  look a little *too* golden brown towards the end of the cooking.

  Shepherd writes:  "BBQing vegetables brings out their sweetness and
  imparts a smoky, nutty quality that is extraordinarily delicious.
  Make them whenever you light up the coals all harvest season."
  
  "Choose colorful ripe garden-fresh vegetables, such as summer squash,
  eggplants, onions and different colored bell peppers. Cut eggplant,
  onions and squash on the bias into about 1/2" thick slices. Cut
  peppers into 2 to 3" strips or big scallops.  About an hour or so
  before cooking, combine vegetables with any good olive oil-based
  vinaigrette or use balsamic vinegar and olive oil with added minced
  garlic, basil, pepper and salt.
  
  "Prepare a BBQ fire, preferably using some fruit wood or mesquite
  chips. When coals are evenly at the white ash stage, drain vegetables
  well and grill on fine mesh BBQ grid about 4 to 6" from the coals.
  Grill as slowly as possible until tender when pierced, turning
  several times and moving vegetables around with a fork so that they
  cook evenly. A little charring on the edges doesn't hurt them. Enjoy
  warm with or without a meat course, and have crusty French bread to
  sop up the tasty juices."

  1). Prepare the meat by triming the border of fat to a thickness of
  1/4". Slash fat at 1" intervals to prevent curling during cooking.
  2). If desired, marinate the meat for one hour or more to tenderize
  and flavor it. Flavor increases with longer marinating. 3). Season
  the meat with pepper, garlic or herbs before placing it on the grill.
  Add salt after grilling because it will draw juices from meat during
  grilling. 4). Place steak on gas grill over medium heat or on
  charcoal grill over medium-high coals. Cook to desired doneness,
  using cooking times listed below. For a juicier steak, turn meat only
  once and do not pierce with a fork.

      Title: GRISSINI AL FINOCCHIO (FENNEL BREAD STICKS)
 Categories: Breads, Herb/spice, Italian
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    3/4 c  ;Warm water (abt. 110 F.)
    3/4 c  Salad oil
    3/4 c  Beer
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Fennel seeds
  4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1    Egg, beaten w/1 tb. water
 
  In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water and let stand 5
  minutes to soften.  Stir in salad oil, beer, salt and fennel seeds.
  With a heavy-duty mixer or wooden spoon, beat in 3 1/2 c. flour until
  dough is elastic (about 5 minutes).
  
  On a board or pastry cloth, spread remaining 1 c. flour and turn out
  dough. Knead, using this technique: lift edge of dough, coated well
  with flour, and fold toward center, avoiding contact with sticky part
  of dough. Continue folding toward center and kneading, turning dough
  as you work, until it is smooth and elastic. Place dough in a greased
  bowl; turn dough to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place
  until doubled (1 to 1 1/4 hours).
  
  On a floured surface, knead just to expel air.  Pinch off lumps (1
  1/2" in diameter) and roll each into a strip that is 18" long. Cut
  each strip in half.
  
  Set wire racks on baking sheets and arrange strips across racks, 1/2"
  apart.  Brush strips with egg-water mixture. Bake at 325 F. for about
  35 minutes or until evenly browned. Serve hot, or cool on wire racks.

      Title: GROUND BEEF TIPS
 Categories: Meats, Info
      Yield: 1 Text
 
           ---  Ground Beef Tips  ---
 
  Ground beef packages are labeled according to U.S. Department of
  Agriculture standards and by supermarket preference. Lean to fat
  ratios vary; however, if a package is labeled ground beef, it must be
  no more thant 30% fat.
  
  A bright, cherry-red color indicates fresh ground beef. However, fresh
  ground beef goes through a number of color changes during its shelf
  life. A darker, purplish-red color is typical of vacuum-packaged
  ground beef or the interior of packaged ground beef which has not
  been exposed to oxygen. Once exposed to oxygen, ground beef will turn
  from darker red to bright red.
  
  Store properly wrapped ground beef in the coldest part of the
  refrigerator (36 F to 40 F); use or freeze within 2 days. Ground beef
  can be frozen in its original transparent packaging for up to 2
  weeks. For longer storage, rewrap ground beef tightly in heavy-duty
  aluminum foil, freezer paper or plastic freezer bags and store up to
  4 months at 0 F or lower.
  
  Defrost ground beef in the refrigerator to prevent bacterial growth.
  Never defrost at room temperature.
  
  Wash hands with hot soapy water before and after handling raw meats.
  Also, wash utensils, counters, cutting boards and other surfaces raw
  meat has touched.
  
  Do not overmix as patties, meatballs and loaves will have a firm,
  compact texture.
  
  Cook ground beef to a least medium (160 F) doneness, or until no
  longer pink and the juices run clear. All forms of ground beef
  including patties, loaves, meatballs and crumbles should be cooked to
  medium doneness. It's risky to eat rare ground beef because surface
  bacteria are transferred to the interior of the meat during grinding.
  
  Brush brown sauces such as teriyaki, Worcestershire or soy on the
  cooked surface of beef patties. When these sauces are mixed into the
  raw product, it is difficult to determine doneness.

      Title: GROUND CHERRY PIE
 Categories: Pies, Fruits
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Pie crust (9" 2-crust)
      3 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    3/4 ts Almond extract
    1/2 ts Nutmeg; grated
           Dash of salt
  2 1/2 c  Ground cherries; husked
      2 tb Butter
 
  "Ground cherries grow wild on low bushy plants along uncut country
  roadsides and in uncultivated fields. They are especially prolific in
  the Mississippi Valley. The fruit goes by several regional names: husk
  tomatoes, chew cherries, strawberry tomatoes, or winter cherries. The
  ground cherry plant is the first cousin to the ornamental Japanese
  lantern, which it resembles. The firm fruit, which is nestled in a
  husk, is about the size of a cherry and looks like a green tomato,
  though the color varies from green to yellow to red. To me, it also
  resembles a tiny Mexican tomatilla. Its flavor has been likened to
  tomatoes and strawberries, and the fruit is most commonly used in
  pie, though I have also eaten it in chili sauce and jam. I see ground
  cherries occasionally at farmer's markets around the country."
  
  Line a 9-inch pie pan with pastry and set aside. Preheat the oven to
      400    degrees F.
  
  In a medium bowl, combine the tapioca, sugars, almond extract,
  nutmeg, and salt. Sprinkle half the mixture in the bottom of the
  pastry shell and top with the cherries. Sprinkle the remainder of the
  sugar mixture over the cherries and dot with the butter. Top with a
  lattice design or other decorative top crust.
  
  Bake for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 degrees F and bake
  about 45 to 50 minutes longer, or until the crust is deep golden and
  the juices in the pie are bubbling up in the center. Cool before
  cutting.

      Title: GROUND SEITAN
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Raw gluten recipe
 
   Place the raw gluten on a well-oiled cookie sheet.
   Using your hands and/or a rolling pin, flatten the gluten out to a
  slab that is about 1/2 inch thick.
   Bake at 350 deg for about 15 minutes.
  
   After 15 minutes or more of baking, the gluten should begin topuff
  up and form  air pockets. Poke these bubles with a fork to let the
  air escape and allow for more even cooking. Bake the gluten for 15-20
  minutes more.
  
   Remove the gluten from the oven and from the cookie sheet. Fold it
  in half and cover it with a large inverted bowl. Let the gluten
  stand, covered, for about 10 minutes to soften the crust.
  
   Tear or cut the baked gluten into pieces and place it in the food
  processor. Briefly grind it to obtain a ground-beef-like texture. If
  you prefer, you may run the gluten through a meat grinder instead of
  a food processor.
  
   Use the ground seitan to make Ground Seitan Mix. Or use it in any
  recipe that is traditionally made with ground beef.

      Title: GRUIBEN (CRACKLINGS)
 Categories: Pork, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 kg Fresh pork bacon [the fatty
           -layer right underneath
           The skin.  K.B.] (approx. 5
           -1/2 lbs)
    1/8 l  Milk or water (1/2 cup plus
           -1/2 Tbsp)
 
  Cut the bacon into 3/4-inch cubes and put into a tall pot which must
  not get filled more than halfway up (to prevent the large amount of
  foam during the rendering process from running over and spilling).
  Heat up slowly, else the bacon will stick to the bottom and scorch.
  As soon as there is a little liquid fat covering the bottom of the
  pot, add milk or water, and heat up more, constantly stirring.  Let
  the cracklings brown a little bit more, then pour off the liquid
  lard, through a sieve, into an earthenware pot. Warm cracklings are
  very popular in-between meal.
  
  Serves 4.

      1 lg Onion, sliced
    125 g  Lard (1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp)
    100 g  Cracklings (3 1/2 oz)
    1/2 tb Pepper
      1 tb (level) salt
           A few Tbsp meat broth or
           -water
 
  This is an old-style recipe from grandma's more thrifty age, and is
  rarely found today.
  
  Slice the potatoes while still hot, and mix in the sliced onion. Add
  the liquid and seasoning. Meanwhile, heat the cracklings in the lard,
  and when very hot, pour over the potato salad, and lightly stir in.
  
  In olden times, this was eaten with a slice of rye bread. Today, one
  could serve it with something like an endive (escarole) salad.
  
  Serves 4.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5 ea Large avocados
      1 ea Medium garlic clove, minced
      1 ea Medium tomato, chopped
      4 oz Can chopped green chili
  2 1/2 tb Lemon or lime juice
      1 ts Salt
 
  Peel and chop avocados into a bowl. Mash with garlic and lemon juice.
  Add remaining ingredients, mixture will be chunky. To prepare
  individual salads, spoon mixture on shredded or whole lettuce leaves.
  Top with diced tomato for garnish and serve with tortilla chips. If
  made ahead of time, save pit and put in dip until time to serve to

  adjusted to taste. Also, I sometimes replace the tomato and green
  chili with salsa.

    1/2 c  Chopped tomato
      2 tb Finely chopped onion
      1 tb Finely chopped serrano or ja

  The VERY BEST guacamole I ever tasted was at the Guadalajara Grill in
  Old Town San Diego.  They make it fresh, right at your table. (I
  recommend the Haas avacodas).
   Here's their recipe: Slice the avacodas in half, remove the pit and
  scoop out the pulp with a spoon. Add all ingredients and mix gently,
  crisscrossing two spoons in the bowl. The idea is to leave the
  avacoda in small chuncks. Susan Husij

      Title: GUAJILLO SALSA
 Categories: Mexican, Salsa, Sauces, Appetizers
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
    1/2 lb Dried Guajillo Chiles
      3 c  Water
      5    Large Cloves Roasted Garlic
      1 ts Ground Cumin
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 lb Roma Tomatoes
      2 ts Toasted Pumpkin Seeds
    1/2 c  Cider Vinegar
      1 ts Mexican Oregano
           -roasted and ground
 
  : GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO REHYDRATE DRIED CHILES: Stem and
  seed the chiles, then place them in a skillet, on a comal, or in a
  250 degree oven and dry-roast them for 3 or 4 minutes. Shake them
  once or twice and be careful not to scorch them or else they will
  taste bitter; this in turn will make sauce taste bitter. The chiles
  should then be added to water that has been heated t just below the
  boiling point, if it is boiling, the chiles will lose flavor. Use
  just enough water to cover the chiles and press them down with a lid.
  Allow them to sit for 20 minutes or until they are soft. At this
  point, you should taste the water to see if it is bitter, discarding
  it if it is. The chiles can then be used as directed in the recipe.
  : METHOD: Remove stems from the Guajillo. Roast and rehydrate the
  chiles. Puree with the remaining ingredients. To use as a sauce, heat
  2 tb peanut oil or lard in a high-sided pan and refry sauce at a
  sizzle for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring continuously. Add a little water
  if necessary. ---

      Title: GUILAINN CHAOIREOLA I DTAOSRAN (LAMB SHOULDER
 Categories: Ireland, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12 oz Shortcrust or flaky pastry
      3 lb Boned shoulder of lamb
      6 tb Butter
      1 tb Mixed chopped herbs
           Salt and black pepper
           Milk or egg to glaze
 
  Make the pastry and chill for at least 1 hour before using. See that
  the lamb is fairly free of fat, and securely tied: put in a roasting
  pan and rub with about a third of the butter. Put into a very hot
  oven, 450F for 20-30 minutes. Take out and allow to cool slightly. --
  Miz the remaining butter with the herbs, salt and pepper. Roll out
  the pastry to a piece large enough to wrap around the joint.
  Carefully remove the string from the lamb, trying to retain the
  shape. Put it in the center of the pastry, dampen the edges, and draw
  the pastry up over the top: secure well by squeezing the pastry ends
  and edges together. Turn over so that the fold is underneath, and put
  on a baking sheet. Prick all over the top lightly with a fork, then
  brush with either the milk or beaten egg. Put into 400F oven and cook
  for about 1/2 hour, or until the pastry is nicely browned. Turn the
  sheet once during baking to make sure the browning is even. Serve,
  cut into fairly thick slices.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Potatoes, waxy type
      5 tb Olive oil
      3 lg Garlic cloves
    1/2 ts Ground turmeric
    1/8 ts Ground asafoetida
      1 ts Salt
      1 pn [generous]cayenne pepper
           - or hot powder
      1 tb Sesame seed
 
  Sesame seed - I used pre-roasted from a Chinese grocery
  
  Gujarat is a part of India on the western coast, right at the Tropic
  of Cancer, between 20 and 25 deg. N. latitude. This recipe, adapted
  from Madhur Jaffrey, uses only one "mystery ingredient," asafoetida
  powder (you should find some if you're going to get into Indian
  cooking at all.)
  
  Jaffrey says use two pounds of medium, very waxy boiling potatoes. I
  used one pound but left everything else the same and it was perfect
  for two hungry people.
  
  Peel potatoes (optional) and cut into long French-fries 3/8" (9mm)
  square. Dunk in a bowl of cold water for 1/2 hour. Peel and sliver
  garlic. Heat the oil in a 9- or 10-inch skillet over medium. Drain
  and pat dry the potato fingers. Put potatoes in hot oil and turn
  occasionally for 8 or 10 minutes to partially cook -- not brown.
  
  Remove potatoes with tongs or slotted spoon to a plate with a paper
  towel on it. From here on you have to move kind of fast: throw the
  sesame seeds into the skillet, stir once. Add the garlic, and
  continue to stir. When it =just= begins to turn brown, quickly add
  turmeric and asafoetida, and stir once more.
  
  After just a couple of seconds put the potatoes back in, with salt and
  cayenne or hot powder. Reduce heat and cook gently until done. Stir
  frequently. (I added a tiny bit of water and loosely covered the
  skillet with a plate during the last few minutes.)

      Title: GUJERATI CARROT SALAD
 Categories: Vegetables, Salads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5    Carrots;medium
    1/4 ts -Salt
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 tb Whole black Mustard seeds
      2 ts Lemon juice
 
  This is a Madhur Jeffrey recipe, published in the Toronto Sun.
  "Jaffrey was in town last week teaching at the Bonnie Stern School of
  Cooking. Using ingredients available locally, primarily in the shops
  along Gerrardjust west of Coxwell, she wowed the classes with her
  masterful teaching, attention to detail and wonderful aromatic
  dishes. She also proved how good and easy Indian cooking can be. ...
   Jaffrey taught us how roasting, crushing and grinding bring out
  different qualities in a spice. Crushing mustard seeds, for example,
  brings out their heat but tossing them 'til they pop in hot oil calms
  the heat and brings out a sweet nuttiness. Black mustard seeds, the
  finest mustard seeds are essential and inexpensive ingredient, found
  in Indian groceries."
  
  Trim and peel and grate carrots. In a bowl, toss with salt and set
  aside. In a small heavy pan over medium heat, heat oil. When very
  hot, add mustard seeds. As soon as the seeds begin to pop, in a few
  seconds, pour oil and seeds over carrots. Add lemon juice and toss.
  SERVES:4 Serve at room temperature or cold.

  Kazuto is the head chef at Chinois on Main.  He has worked with me at
  Ma Maison, Spago, and now at Chinois, where he developed this tasty
  salad. (WP)
  
  1. Prepare the sauce: In a blender or food processor fitted with the
  steel blade, puree the tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, garlic, and tomato
  paste. Transfer to a medium bowl. Chop the cilantro leaves very fine
  and fold into the sauce.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and
  set aside.
  
  2. Peel the shrimp, leaving the tails intact.  Season lightly with
  salt and pepper.  In a large skillet, heat the peanut oil. Without
  crowding the pan, cook the shrimp, about 1-1.2 minutes on each side.
  If necessary, do it it batches.
  
  Presentation: Set the radicchio leaves on one half of a large serving
  platter.  Toss the greens with the vinaigrette and spoon equal
  mamounts into each of the radicchio leaves. Place the endive
  attractively around the radicchio.  Spoon the sauce over the
  remaining half of the platter and arrange the shrimp on the sauce.
  Garnish with the garlic chives and julienne of peppers.  Serve
  immediately. (You can also do this on individual platter, placing one
  radicchio leaf on each plate, diving the remaining engredients
  equally.)
  
  To prepare ahead: Through step 1.  In step 2, peel the shrimp and
  refrigerate, covered, until needed. Continue with the recipe at
  serving time.
  
  Chinois Vinaigrette: At Chinois, we combine rice wine vinegar, peanut
  oil, soy sauce, and sesame oil to give the vinaigrette a distinctive
  oriental flavor. (WP)
  
  1. In a small bowl whisk together all the ingredients, seasoning with
  salt and pepper to taste.  Use as needed.
  
  To prepare ahead: Through step 1, refrigerating, covered, until
  needed.

      Title: GULLIVER'S CREAMED SPINACH
 Categories: Entrees
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     10 oz Spinach, chopped
           -(frozen or fresh)
      3 sl Bacon
      1 sm Onion
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
      3 tb Flour
  1 1/4 c  Milk (we substitute
           -a like quantity of
           -50/50 Kosher Parve
           -creamer and water)
 
  Rinse and chop the spinach.  Place the chopped spinach in a heavy
  skillet, cover, and steam until wilted, stirring occasionally. There
  is no need to add water other than what clings to the leaves from
  washing. (If you are using frozen spinach, place over low or medium
  heat to thaw and allow excess water to evaporate) Transfer to small
  bowl and squeeze completely dry.
  
  Grind bacon and onion very fine and place in saucepan. Saute bacon and
  onion until bacon is cooked. Stir in flour to make smooth paste.
  Gradually add milk. Bring to boil and simmer 10 minutes over low heat
  until thickened.
  
  Add salt and pepper.  Grind spinach fine and add to cream sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Creamed spinach with bacon -- This is a creamed spinach recipe
  that we found in the _Los Angeles Times_. It produces a creamed
  spinach that even my wife likes.
  
  *  You may find that you want to add extra milk and give the finished
  soup a final heating in the microwave. We did, and it didn't hurt it
  one bit.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Soups, Hungarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 tb Bacon grease
      1    Green chile; (opt, julienne)
      2 lg Onion; chopped
      2    Garlic clove; smashed &

           Pepper, black
           Garlic salt; to taste
           Sour cream; for garnish
 
  In large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, saut peppers & onions in the
  bacon drippings until onions are translucent. Make a space, and add
  garlic directly to the hot surface, stirring until fragrant. Now add
  the paprika and stir it all until it loses its raw smell. Add cubed
  meats, canned tomatoes and a hefty grinding of pepper and stir. When
  mixture reaches a simmer, cover and allow to cook for 1 to 1-1/2
  hours, until meat is tender. Check after 45 minutes; if there seems
  to be too much liquid, leave cover off to reduce sauce. And if, when
  the meat is tender, there is still too much sauce, thicken it in the
  following manner: remove a cup or so of liquid and stir into it
  perhaps a teaspoon of arrowroot; return all to pan and stir until
  thickened nicely. Serve on noodles if you like, although they're not
  absolutely necessary. Suggestion: serve WITH fresh, steamed green
  beans, left whole.

  Guaranteed to conjure up dreams of moss-draped oaks and the bayou.
  This was developed with the help of a Cajun friend's memory of
  watching his mama cook it every Friday night when he was a boy in
  Louisiana. Making a "roux" with the flour and lard is the most
  important part and the secret of a good gumbo.  Be careful and don't
  let it burn.
  
  In a heavy pan, melt the lard (shortening: over very low heat. Add
  flour and stir continuously until it turns a tawny brown color (it
  may take as long as 15 minutes, but don't rush it because if it
  burns, the gumbo will be ruined).  Now add the onion, garlic, celery,

 Categories: Vegetarian, Low-fat, Vegetables
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     12 c  Water
      6 ts Vegetable Bouillon granules
      4    Tomatoes, fresh or 1-lb can
    1/2 c  Corn, fresh or canned
      1    Celery rib, diced
      1    Onion, diced
    1/2 c  Okra, cut
    1/4 c  Rice, white or brown
    1/8 ts Tabasco Sauce (optional)
      1 c  Shredded cabbage (optional)
 
  Directions: Place all ingredients in a large pot, bring to boil,
  cover and simmer about 20 minutes until all vegetables are done.
  1-l/2 C serving equals about
       35    calories.
  
  NOTE:  I use Uncle Ben's Converted Rice as it seems to hold its shape
  better in long cooking periods.  Any rice will work if this soup is
  not reheated several times, but it usually is!
  
  This is a thin soup, I sometimes add shredded cabbage, chard, bok
  choy, or other green vegetable to it.  The greens make it thicker and
  more filling, but add few calories. This doesn't resemble the real
  Cajun Gumbo, but is good for those days when you feel you've
  over-indulged and need to cut back.  I keep in it the fridge and use
  it as a snack when I just have to have something else. You can also
  add herbs, hot pepper, it is very versatile, and a good starting
  recipe.

 Categories: Grains
      Yield: 6 Cups
 
      2 c  White rice, preferably
           -converted
  2 1/2 c  Chicken stock, homemade
           -or canned
  1 1/2 ts Onions, very finely

  1 1/2 ts Celery, very finely
           -chopped
    1/8 ts Garlic powder
  1 1/2 ts Green bell pepper,
           -very finely chopped
  1 1/2 ts Butter (unsalted),
           -melted
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 pn White pepper
      1 pn Cayenne
      1 pn Black pepper
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine all the ingredients in a
  5x9 inch loaf pan. Seal the pan snugly with aluminum foil. Bake until
  the rice is tender, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A basic steamed rice for gumbo dishes -- If you are making the
  gumbo for appetizer servings, make a 1/3 recipe. If you make this
  ahead, leave out the bell peppers, since they sour quickly.
  
  *  You can use the rice right away, or leave it in the oven to stay
  warm for a couple of hours. If you save it longer than that, reheat
  in the top of a double boiler or stir it in a skillet with a little
  butter.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 70 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  This is almost a liquid, so makes a fun change from other doughs.
  Clean up is the easiest of all doughs, as when it dries it is simply
  swept up.
  
  Any that is left can be plaed in a clean glass jar and let dry. It
  can then be reconstituted by simply adding water.

      Title: GUSANOS DE MAGUEY ESTILO PACHUCA (MAGUEY WORM
 Categories: Mexican, Weird, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE WORMS----------------------------
      5 c  Vegetable oil
      4 c  Maguey worms, cleaned
      8    Tortillas

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE GARNISH---------------------------
      8    Balls fresh masa, 1 inch in
           -diameter
      8    Limes, sliced
      2    Fresh cactus flowers
           -(optional)
 
  Forgot to include this in the packet from the other board. Karin
  Brewer sent me the following recipe via snail mail. Apparently
  there's a large, semi-permanent black hole hovering over her house
  and she's having trouble getting out.  Been wondering where she was...
  
  Maguey worms, a Mexican specialty, are popular in the state of
  Hidalgo, where maguey grows abundantly.  The worms were sold in
  cocoons on the street until a few years ago. Today, this dish is
  considered to be a delicacy.
  
  Heat 1 cup oil in a thick skillet and fry worms until crisp. Remove
  and drain on paper towels.
  
  Heat 4 cups oil in a deep saucepan or deep fryer. Press tortillas in
  a mesh strainer, and fry one by one until they become crisp and take
  the shape of the strainer. Drain well on paper towels.
  
  To serve, place a little ball of masa on each of 8 plates, and put
  tortilla "baskets" on top, pressing to fix in place. Fill tortillas
  with worms. Garnish with lime slices and flowers. Serve with
  guacamole and green sauce. This appetizer is good with tequila or
  pulque.
  
  The worms can also be used as a taco stuffing.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

 Categories: Meats, Romanian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Lambs toung heart & liver
      1 x  Onion, large, chopped
      1 tb Bland lard*see note*
      5 x  Slices dutch toast*note*
      5 x  Eggs
      1 x  Parsley, to taste
      1 x  Salt and pepper, to taste
 
   Parboil tounge and remove skin and any veins. Cut up lungs, heart,
  toung and livers into small chunks; sautee onion in lard*NOTE* what
  they call bland lard I would consider to be white, or refined top
  lard< add meat and brown lightly. Chill. Grind up chilled meat and
  onions. Turn into a bowl add the toast*NOTE* "Dutch Toast" I think is
  like a garlic bread without the garlic, But I'd use stale garlic
  bread< add eggs, chopped parsley, salt and pepper and mix well.
    Place lamb casing in a greased baking dish, place mixture in casing
  and fold over edges. Bake at 350 deg for one hour or until done.
    If you wish you may leave out the casing and just make a meatloaf
  out of this, topped with rashers of bacon and tomato sauce or salsa.
    One variation is to place the meats in a pan with onion, carrot and
  parsley and boil until tender. Remove from water, skin tounge and put
  meats through a food grinder. Fry onions until transparent and add to
  meat mixture, with more parsley, dill, salt and pepper, and eggs. Mix
  eggs in well.
    Another variation is to take one egg, five tablespoons of flour, a
  walnut sized hunk of butter and enough cold water to make a dough,
  cut the flour, butter and egg together as for pie dough and roll out
  large enough to cover bottom of casserole dish and encase meat
  mixture, fold dough over top and prick several times with a fork.
  Bake as above.

      Title: GUVEC OR TURLU - VEGETABLE CASSEROLE
 Categories: Turkish, Ethnic, Vegetables, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Long eggplants; -OR-
      1 md -Oval eggplant
           Salt
      4 sm Zucchini
      3 sm Sweet green peppers
    250 g  Okra; optional
    250 g  Green beans
      4 sm Tomatoes, ripe, peeled
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      3 sm Onions; sliced
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  -Water
 
  There is some confusion about the name of this dish. To the Turks,
  Turlu is a lamb or chicken and vegetable casserole. Yet in other
  countries of the region Turlu is prepared as an all-vegetable
  casserole, with cooks admitting to it being a Turkish dish.  Guvec on
  the other hand is a casserole of meat or poultry and vegetables, or
  vegetables on their own.
  
  Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 1-1/2 to
        2    hours
  
  Remove stem from eggplant, wash well then peel off 1 cm (1/2 inch)
  strips of skin lengthwise at intervals giving a striped effect. Cut
  long eggplants in 1 cm (1/2 inch) slices; oval eggplant should be
  quartered lengthwise, then cut into chunky pieces.  Spread eggplant
  on a tray and sprinkle liberally with salt. Leave for 30 minutes,
  then pat dry with paper towels.
  
  Trim zucchini and cut into 4 cm (1-1/2 inch) pieces. Remove stem and
  seeds from peppers and quarter.  Wash, trim and (if desired) de-fuzz
  okra. Soak in vinegar to remove slime. Drain.
  
  String beans if necessary and slit in half (French cut). Slice
  tomatoes.
  
  Heat half the oil in a frying pan and fry eggplant until lightly
  browned. Remove to a plate - do not drain.
  
  Add remaining oil to a pan, add sliced onions and fry gently until
  transparent.  Stir in garlic, cook 1 minute, then remove pan from
  heat.
  
  Place a layer of eggplant in the base of a casserole dish. Top with
  some of the zucchini, peppers and beans. Spread some onion mixture on
  top and cover with tomato slices.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper and
  some of the parsley. Repeat until all ingredients are used, reserving
  some tomato slices and parsley.
  
  Place prepared okra on top if used and cover with last of tomato.
  Sprinkle with parsley, salt and pepper and add water and oil drained
  from eggplant.
  
  Cover casserole and cook in a moderate oven for 1 to 1-1/2 hours until
  vegetables are tender.  Serve from casserole as an accompaniment to
  roast or grilled meats or poultry. Often this is served as a light
  meal on its own; bread and peynir (feta) cheese are then served with
  it.

  results. BTW, is anyone out there reading the posts of those who are
  taking their time? How about joining in for some variety. I know
  would like some new ones such as from  Kathleen and Rita and Frank

           Vinegar & oil to taste
      1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 c  Plain yogurt
 
  In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb with the bread, allspice,
  coriander, garlic, onion, savory, and salt and pepper, and knead
  thoroughly.  The mixture should be spicy, though not too herby, and
  hold its shape. Break into 5 sections, each as large as a navel
  orange, then break each section into 6 balls. Knead and flatten
  slightly to a thickness of about 3/4". Cut the bacon slices into
  widths equal to these balls, keeping the slices of bacon between
  them.  Slip a cane skewer through the centers and roll gently with
  the palms to smooth the edges. (There will be 5 or 6 skewers,
  depending on their length.) Cover and refrigerate overnight.  When
  ready to cook, set on a broiler tray or grill and cook under moderate
  heat, turning every 5 minutes. (The bacon will baste the meat.)  The
  surface will be crusty and the inside cooked within 25 minutes. To
  serve:  Put out the bread, meat, tomatoes seasoned with the vinegar
  and oil, parsley and yogurt in separate dishes.  Guests may open
  pocket bread and stuff them with meat and seasonings. From: "The Food

    1/4 ts Parsley
      1 ts Salt,
    1/4 ts Pepper ; freshly ground,
      8 ea Lg Pita
 
  (recipe follows).  Mix all ingredients except pita, mixing well and
  kneading until m;ixture is stiff.  On skewer pack meat mixture about
  5" long and not more than 2" in diam. Put as many "fingers" as
  possible on a skewer leav- ing a 1" space in between.  Cook over hot
  coals o 10 to 15 mintues,  turning frequently.. Take pita and slide
  gyro onto center. Drizzle with sauce.  Fold over to eat SAUCE:   Mix
  together 1 cup yogurt, 2 Tbp. mayo,  juice of 1 lemon, 2 scal- lions
  incl. green tops, finely chopped. I have another recipe that gives
  the following for the meat mixture:   2# lean ground lamb,  2  slices
  homemade gread toasted and crumbled; 1 tsp. crushed allspice, 1 tsp.
  crushed corian- der seed1 clove pressed garlic; 1 grated onion; 1
  tsp. chopped fresh savory; salt and freshly ;ground pepper.   This
  latter recipe also suggests wrapping the "fingers" on the skewer with
  sliced bacon. If anyone tries this, let me know how it works out. I
  have this frequently in Greece and here in the U.S.,  but as I have
  said, I view it as a "deli" item. Krinos Foods has a "gyros kit" that
  is sold in the frozen food section of some supermarkets. FROM:    C

  *including some fat 8 or more slices blanched bacon or fresh pork
  belly slices, if available Grind lamb and beef together, using large
  hole plate on meat grinder. Regrind using small hole plate. In small
  bowl reconstitute onions in water. In another small bowl combine next
  6 ingredients and mix thoroughly.  In large bowl combine meat, onions
  and spice mix. Add garlic and vegetable oil; mix thoroughly with
  hands until spices are evenly distributed; refrigerate, covered,
  several hours.
   In a small skillet, fry a small amount of the meat mixture in a
  little butter. Taste for seasoning and adjust, if desired.
   Blanch bacon by simmering in hot water about 3 minutes. If pork
  belly is used, blanching is not necessary. Drain on paper towels.
  Line loaf pan (8 1/2 x 5 x 3") with bacon or pork slices, covering
  sides and bottom; pack gyros meat into pan, filling to the top of the
  pan. Cover with remaining slices of bacon or pork. Place filled pan
  in hot water bath, reaching 3/3/4 of the way up the loaf pan.  Bake
  at 375^F. for 20-30 minutes. Reduce heat to 325^ and continue baking
  30 minutes longer. Remove pan from oven; remove loaf pan from hot
  water bath and place on wire rack to cool. Cover with aluminum foil
  and weigh with about 2 lbs weight to compress loaf. Cool to room
  temperature; refrigerate meat, covered with weight 12 hours or
  overnight to ripen and increase flavor. Meat will keep for up to 4
  days refrigerated. Slice thin and serve in pita bread with sliced
  onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce. (I don't have a meat grinder and
  usually call my butcher and request the grinding. I also prefer this

    1/4 lb Precooked salad shrimp,
           -chopped
      2 oz Pork fat, chopped fine
    1/4 c  Bamboo shoots, chopped
    1/4 ts Ground white pepper
    1/4 ts Grated fresh ginger
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Chopped green onion
      1    Egg white
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Cornstarch
           Dough:
      2 tb Potato starch
      1 c  Wheat starch
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Boiling water, plus
      3 tb Boiling water
      1 ts Lard
 
  Place all filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well, by hand until
  the ingredients form a smooth and rather firm stuffing. This will
  take about 2 minutes. Dough: Measure both starches and salt into a
  small mixing bowl. Quickly pour the boiling water into the starches
  while stirring with chopsticks until you get a partially cooked
  dough. Do not overwork the dough. Quickly add the lard in little
  pinches and then knead until smooth. When the dough is smooth, after
  about 2 minutes' kneading, cover it with the mixing bowl and allow it
  to rest for 15 minutes before shaping. To shape the dumplings, pull
  just a bit more than 1 tsp of dough from the ball.  Keep the
  remainder of the dough covered with the bowl. Roll the small amount
  into a ball and place onto a floured marble board. Roll out into a
  circle about 3 inches in diameter. Place 1 t of the shrimp filling in
  the center of the circle of dough and fold over into a half-moon. Use
  a tiny bit of water for sealing the edges.  Be sure to gently press
  out all the air.  If you wish, you can form little pleats in the
  dough for added decoration. Steam on an oiled bamboo steaming rack
  for 12 minutes. From The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient Cuisines,

      2 tb Water
      1 c  Golden raisins
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
           Confectioners sugar
 
  Note: It has never ceased to amuse Dr. McCoy that Mr. Spock, with all
  his logical training, cannot consider Ha Rageel a close equivalent to
  Tufeen Hushani. Actually, to the logical Vulcan mind, a ceremonial
  wedding cake is quite unrelated to an "everyday" dessert loaf. It is
  quite true that they contain many of the same ingredients and have a
  somewhat similar taste. But this no more makes them related than the
  same number of eyes and legs makes first cousins of horses and dogs.
  To a cook the difference is also important. Preparing the wedding
  cake requires time, attention, and care to avoid a minor disaster;
  with Ha Rageel you can hardly go wrong.
    Preheat the oven to 350. Grease a 2-quart ring mold with a little
  butter.
    Peel the carrots and grate them. Grate the yellow rind off the
  lemon, using the coarse set of teeth on your grater. Leave enough of
  the white inner rind so that you can squeeze the lemon for its juice
  when you are done grating.
    Cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is somewhat
  light colored. Add the eggs, mix well, then add the carrots, lemon
  juice and rind, water and raisins.
    In a smaller bowl mix together the dry ingredients, exept the
  confectioners sugar, and add them to the liquid part a bit at a time.
  When it is well mixed, pour the batter into the greased mold. Bake
  for about 40 minutes, or until a knife or skewer stuck into it comes
  out clean. Let it cool for about 5 minutes, unmold on a serving plate
  and dust with confectioners sugar.
    Note: If you dust the plate with a little confectioners sugar
  before you unmold the cake onto it, the cake will tend to stick to it
  less.

        1 pn salt
        1 ts dry jerk seasoning
      1/2 c  vegetable oil
      1/2 c  flour
        1 qt heavy cream
        2 c  chicken stock
      1/3 c  tomato sauce
      1/3 c  tasso or smoked ham
  
  Season the chicken pieces with Poultry Magic. Melt 1/2 pound butter
  in a 4-quart saucepan. Add the chicken pieces and saute until cooked,
  about 7 minutes. Remove the chicken and drain it on paper towels.
  Pour off the butter from the saucepan and then add all the vegetables
  and seasonings. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the
  vegetables soften, about 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  As the vegetables soften, make a roux. Heat the vegetable oil until it
  begins to smoke. Reduce the heat and add a small amount of flour and
  stir to combine. Keep adding the flour in small amounts until all the
  flour is incorporated with the oil and the flour mixture is caramel
  colored. Stir constantly to keep the roux from scorching.
  
  When the vegetables have softened, add the cream, chicken stock,
  tomato sauce, cooked chicken and tasso. Cook until the liquid has
  reduced by half. Add the roux, one tablespoon at a time until the
  mixture has thickened moderately. Stir in the rest of the butter, one
  tablespoon at a time, until incorporated. Serve over a large square
  of cornbread.

      1 cl Garlic
    1/2    Grated carrot

      1 ts Leaf oregano
           Lawrey's seasoned salt
    1/4 ts Worstershire sauce
    1/2 c  Honey
 
  cook the onions in the olive oil until they just start to turn
  golden. half way through this process add the grated carrot. Then add
  the minced garlic and stir for a minute, just to soften it. Add the
  oregano at this time as well. Stir over moderate heat for about a
  minute. Add the habaneros and the vinegar, bring to a simmer, cover
  and cook about 10 minutes until the habs are soft. take off the heat
  and cool a little bit. Put in the blender and blend thoroughly.
  
  Put back in the pot and bring to a simmer again. add chicken broth,
  worstershire sauce, and honey. salt to taste. Add the tequila and
  cook long enough to take away the raw alcohol flavor.
  
  it's pretty hot but the carrots and honey make it so you can taste the
  flavor of the habs without scorching yourself in the process. The
  chicken broth and tequila ensure that it's not too vinegary.
  
  I'm going to try a variation on this with my jalapeno crop when it
  comes due... I'll let you know.  Walt - MM - Chile-Heads

      1    Clove garlic, mashed or
           -minced
      1 bn Parsley, finely chopped
      1 pn Sugar
      2 tb Lard
      1    Onion, sliced
      4    To 5 cloves garlic, whole
    1/2    Yellow turnip, sliced
           -[substitute: carrot]
           Water for pan gravy
 
  Mix the ground meat with all the other ingredients [except for the
  lard, the sliced yellow turnip, sliced onion, and whole garlic
  cloves] and shape into a rectangular loaf. Put in a casserole dish
  with the lard, the sliced onion, whole garlic cloves, and sliced
  yellow turnip. Roast at 390 degrees F until the onions turn brown.
  Then, add a little bit of water. Continue to roast, basting
  frequently.  Add more water as needed. If the crust is getting too

  days, the cook put a clay tile on top of the meatloaf to achieve the
  same effect.
  
  At 390 degrees F, the meatloaf will be done after 1 1/2 hours and may
  be served immediately, sliced, and topped with the reheated pan
  juices.
  
  Serve with potato salad or green salad [lettuce].

  3 1/2 lb Haddock
    1/3 lb Salt pork
      2    Medium onions, chopped
      2 c  Pared, diced potatoes
      1 qt Whole milk
      1 cn Evaporated milk
 
  HADDOCK CHOWDER From America:
  
  Have the haddock cleaned and cut up to boil.  Barely cover with salted
  water and cook until the fish comes off the bones. Don't cook until
  the flesh is soft and mushy. Set aside to cool.
  
  While fish is cooling, cut the pork into 1/4" cubes and fry until
  crisp in a large heavy kettle. Drain the cubes on paper towels and
  pour off all but 4 tbls of the fat. In this fat, cook the chopped
  onions over low heat until trnasparent.  Add the potatoes and enough
  of the fish liquor to cover them. Simmer gently until potatoes are
  cooked.
  
  Pick the fish flakes from the bones, adding to the chowder mixture
  when the potatoes are done.  Add quart of milk and evaporated milk.
  Set aside until serving time.
  
  It imporves the flavor of the chowder greatly to let it stand for
  several hours before serving.  Be sure it is piping hot when bringing
  it to the table.
  
  Biscuits and pickles always go with a good chowder.

 Categories: Barry, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Haddock Fillets, Skinned
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Oil
      2 oz Flour
      1 lg Beefsteak Tomato
      5 fl Double cream
           Salt and Pepper
 
  In a large non-stick frying pan, melt the butter in the oil until it
  stops sizzling. Coat fish lightly in flour and fry gently for 4
  minutes each side. Peel tomato by covering it with boiling water for
  30 seconds. The skin should slip off - mind your fingers, though! cut
  tomato in half, scoop out seeds and cut flesh into half-inch strips.
  Put these into pan with fish and cook gently for 1 minute. Take fish
  out and put it on to to warm plates. Pour cream into pan and bring it
  to boil - double cream won't curdle - stirring so it picks up all the
  lovely fish and tomato bits. Season, then pour the sauce over the
  fish. Mashed potatoes are perfect with it.

    1/2 ts Black pepper;freshly ground*
    1/2 ts Cayenne

           -cooking type
      1 c  Broth; in which liver, heart
           -were cooked; up to 1 1/2c
 
  This recipe make enough to serve 6-10. If you are able to find a
  sheep's stomach, double the amounts. Rinse and repeat till clean.
  *Anne's note, I would increase both the pepper & onion; most of the
  haggis I've eaten makes liberal use of these ingredients If the
  butcher has not trimmed the heart, liver and lungs do that first.
  (Cut the heart open to rinse it so it may cook more quickly.) Put
  them in a large pot with 1 to 1/2 cups water, bring to a boil and
  simmer for about an hour and a half. Let it all cool and keep the
  broth. Run the liver and heart through the meat grinder. Take the
  lungs (lights) and cut out as much grisly part as you can and run
  them through a grinder too. Next put the raw beef suet through the
  grinder. As you finish grinding each thing, put it in the big pot.
  Peel, slice and chop onions and then add them to the meat in the
  kettle. Add the salt and spices and mix. Toast or brown oatmeal
  lightly in heavy bottomed pan on top of the stove. Add to pot and mix
  thoroughly. Add 1 to 1/2 cup broth left from boiling the meat. Check
  if it sticks together when you grab a handful of the mixture. If not,
  add more broth so that it holds together. Stuff in plastic baking bag
  till about 3/4 full. If you are using a sheep stomach, have the
  smooth side out and stuff it about 3/4 full and sew up the opening.
  Wrap in cheesecloth so that when it is cooked, you can handle it.
  Prick with a skewer (so it won't explode from the steam). (You may
  wish to do this occasionally early on when cooking). Fill large pot
  with at least 1 gallon of water and bring to a boil. Boil gently for
  4 to 5 hours. Serve with neeps (turnips) or clapshot (mashed turnips
  & potatoes) SERVES:6-10

           -(You can substitute a
           -Selection of organ meats)
      2    Onions; peeled
      2 c  Pinhead oatmeal; (Irish

  1 2/3 c  Suet
           Salt & pepper
           -trussing needle and fine
           - stirng
 
  Thoroughly wash the stomach bag in cold water.  Turn it inside out and
  scald it, then scrape the surface with a knife. Soak it in cold salted
  water overnight. Next day remove the bag from the water and leave it
  on one side while preparing the filling. Wash the pluck. Put it into
  a pan, with the windpipe hanging over the side into a bowl, to let
  out any impurities. Cover the pluck with cold water, add 1 teaspoon
  of salt and bring the water to a boil. Skim the surface, then simmer
  for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Meanwhile parboil the onions, drain, reserving
  the ligquid, and chop them roughly. Also tpast the pinhead oatmeal
  until golden brown. Drain the pluck when ready and cut away the
  windpipe and any excess gristle. Mince half the liver with all the
  heart and lights, then stir in the shredded suet, the toasted oatmeal
  and the onions. Season well with salt and pepper. Moisten with as
  much of the onion or pluck water as necessary to make the mixture
  soft. With the rough surface of the bag outside fill it just over
  half full, the oatmeal will swell during cooking, and sew the ends
  together with the trussing needle and fine string. Prick the bag in
  places with the needlw. Place the haggis on and enamel plate and put
  it into a pan of boiling water. Cover the pan and cook for about 3
  hours, adding more boiling water when necessary to keep the haggis
  covered. Serve with the traditional accompaniment of
  Tatties-an'Neeps. (Mashed potatoes and mashed turnips.)

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Sheep's stomach, thoroughly
           -cleaned
           The liver, heart, and lights
           -(lungs) of the sheep
      1 lb Beef suet
      2 lg Onions
      2 tb Salt
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Cayenne or red pepper
    1/2 ts Allspice
      2 lb Dry oatmeal (the
           -old-fashioned, slow-cooking
           -kind)
      2    Or 3 cups broth (in which
           -the liver, heart and lights
           -were
           Cooked)
           Utensils
      4 qt Pot with lid
 
  What you need: Canning kettle or a large spaghetti pot, 16- to 20
  quart size with a lid to fit it Meat grinder Cheesecloth What to do:
  If the butcher has not already cut apart and trimmed the heart, liver
  and lungs, do that first.  It involves cutting the lungs off the
  windpipe, cutting the heart off the large bloodvessels and cutting it
  open to rinse it, so that it can cook more quickly. The liver, too,
  has to be freed from the rest. Put them in a 4-quart pot with 2 to 3
  cups water, bring to a boil, and simmer for about an hour and a half.
  Let it all cool, and keep the broth. Run the liver and heart through
  the meat grinder. Take the lungs and cut out as much of the gristly
  part as you easily can, then run them through the grinder, too. Next,
  put the raw beef suet through the grinder. As you finish grinding
  each thing, put it in the big kettle. Peel, slice and chop the
  onions, then add them to the meat in the kettle. Add the salt and
  spices and mix. The oatmeal comes next, and while it is customary to
  toast it or brown it very lightly in the oven or in a heavy bottomed
  pan on top of the stove, this is not absolutely necessary. When the
  oatmeal has been thoroughly mixed with the rest of it, add the 2 cups
  of the broth left from boiling the meat. See if when you take a
  handful, it sticks together. If it does, do not add the third cup of
  broth. If it is still crumbly and will not hold together very well,
  add the rest of the broth and mix thoroughly. Have the stomach smooth
  side out and stuff it with the mixture, about three-quarters full.
  Sew up the openings. Wrap it in cheesecloth,so that when it is cooked
  you can handle it. Now, wash out the kettle and bring about 2 gallons
  of water to a boil in it. Put in the haggis and prick it all over
  with a skewer so that it does not burst. You will want to do this a
  couple of times early in the cooking span. Boil the haggis gently for
  about 4 or 5 hours. If you did not have any cheesecloth for wrapping
  the haggis, you can use a large clean dishtowel. Work it under with
  kitchen spoons to make a sling with which you can lift out the haggis
  in one piece. You will probably want to wear lined rubber gloves to
  protect your hands from the hot water while you lift it out with the
  wet cloth. (You put the dish cloth in the pot only after the haggis
  is done; you do not cook the towel with the haggis as you would the
  cheesecloth.) Note: Even if the butcher has cleaned the stomach, you
  will probably want to go over it again. Turn the stomach shaggy side
  out and rinse. Rub it in a sinkful of cold water. Change the water
  and repeat as many times as necessary, until the water stays pretty
  clear and handling it does not produce much sediment as the water
  drains out of the sink.

  Clean the bag thoroughly,washing well in cold water,then in warm and
  scraping till fresh.Then soak it overnight in cold water to which a
  little salt has been added.Well wash the pluck,and put on to boil
  with sufficient cold water to cover.See that the windpipe hangs over
  the side of the pot, so that any impurities may escape.Boil 1 1/2 to
  2 hours,remove from water and allow to cool.Retain a pint of the
  liquid for use afterwards.Now cut away the windpipe, and any
  superfluous gristle.Chop the heart and lights and grate half the

  suet and the onions (which have been par-boiled and finely chopped )
  then the oatmeal toasted to a pale brown in the oven or in front of
  the fire.Add the pepper and salt mix thoroughly, then stir in the
  pint of pluck liquid.Now fill into the bag which should be only
  slightly more than half full in order to allow room for swelling.Sew
  up the hole securely with needle and thread and place in a pan of
  boiling water big enough to take the haggis comfortably. If liked a
  glass of milk can be added to the water in which it is boiled. To
  prevent the bag from bursting,prick it occasionally all over as it
  boils. Continue to boil steadily without a lid for three hours.If the
  haggis is not to be used right away remove from pan and place on a
  flat dish.Later reheat by boiling it steadily for at least half an
  hour.Serve on a folded napkin placed on a hot dish and before serving
  make a three cornered gash in the top so that the serving spoon can
  be inserted easily.Serve with potatoes (cooked in their jackets or
  mashed),mashed turnip and brussels sprouts.If sheep's bag is not
  available,pack mixture into a basin ,cover with greaseproof paper and
  a scalded cloth and steam steadily for four to five hours.

      6 oz Oatmeal, medium; 175 grams

  "Haggis, "The great Chieftain of the pudding' race", as Robert Burns,
  described it, is indeed a toothsome morsel and it is a great pity
  that many English people look upon it as more a Scottish joke than a
  good Scottish dish. However since Haggis is made from the stomach,
  lungs and other internals of a sheep it is a rather gruesome sight
  during certain stages of its cooking, as anyone who has witnessed the
  process will agree. The lung must be first be heating in a pan of hot
  water with the trachea hanging over the side to allow any blood and
  froth to escape and the stomach bag must be cleaned and scraped very
  thoroughly before it is used. I must say from experience that it
  takes needs a fairly robust stomach to first prepare and then eat it.
  If you can buy prepared haggis I do strongly recommend you to try it.
  All you need to do is slice it and fry it in a lightly greased frying
  pan. If you cannot buy ready-made haggis, then the following is tasty
  substitute.."
  
  Boil the liver for five minutes. Drain and put aside to cool. Toast
  the oatmeal in a dry frying pan or in the oven until it begins to
  turn a pale brown. Peel and mince the onions and the liver. Mix all
  the ingredients with the seasoning and stir in some of the water in
  which the liver has been boiled. The mixture should be thoroughly
  moist but not wet. Have ready a greased basin large enough to give
  the mixture room to swell. Cover with greaseproof paper and a cloth
  and boil or steam for three hours. The traditional way to serve
  haggis is with mashed potatoes and turnips - "tatties and neeps", as
  they are called in Scotland - and to give the meal a truly Scottish
  flavour you should serve a glass of whiskey along with it. I like to
  let the mock haggis go cold and then slice it and heat it through in
  a frying pan (without fat) until golden brown on both sides. This way
  it is very good with poached eggs and even with chips.
  
  Note: if your mince looks to be on the fatty side, then cut down the
  quantity of suet to 4 oz (100grams).

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Pork fat or salt pork
      1 lb Pork liver; approx 3 lb
  1 1/2 c  Rolled oats
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
 
  This New Brunswick recipe reflects a change in the traditional haggis
  ~ a change which recent Scottish arrivals consider akin to sacrilege.
  Directions: Grease a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan. Cut Pork fat in cubes and
  fry out the fat from the pork or salt pork fat. Pour off the grease
  as it accumulates.  When the pieces are golden brown and crisp they
  are called "crackin's in Ontario, or "Kips" in the Maritimes. Drain
  well. Cool. Wash the pork liver and place in a large pot. Cover with
  boiling water and boil for about 1 hour, or until a fork can easily
  be inserted. Remove liver and allow to cool. Reserve liquid. Put
  cooled liver and 2 cups of cracklin's through the food grinder. Mix
  together. Stir in the oats, salt and pepper. Add sufficient cooking
  liquid to hold mixture together. Press into prepared loaf pan, cover
  with waxed paper and foil. Steam for 1 hour. Cool. To Serve, slice
  1/2 inch thick and pan fry until golden brown on both sides. Serve
  piping hot.

MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 6 SERVINGS--------------------------
      2 lb Haggis
      2 lb Potatoes; peeled & cut into
           -eighths
  1 1/2 lb Yellow turnips (rutabagas),
           -peeled & cut into 1/2"

      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Butter; melted
    1/3 c  Milk; warmed
           Fresh lavender, rosemary, &
           -sage for garnish (opt)
           Scotch whiskey
 
  In a 6 quart saucepot, bring 3 quarts water to boiling. Pierce casing
  of the haggis once with a fork. Carefully place the haggis into the
  pot of boiling water and boil 45 to 60 minutes or until haggis feels
  firm and is cooked through. One-half hour before haggis had finished
  cooking, prepare Tatties (mashed potatoes) and Neeps (turnips)/ In a
  3 quart saucepan, combine potatoes and water to cover. Heat to
  boiling over high heat; reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until
  potatoes are tender- about 20 minutes. In a 2 quart saucepan, combine
  turnips, 1/2 tsp salt, and water to cover. Heat to boiling over high
  heat; reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until turnips are tender-
  about 25 to 30 minutes. When potatoes are tender, drain well and
  return to saucepan. With electric mixer, beat potatoes on low speed
  until all pieces are broken up. Add 1/2 tsp salt, 2 Tbsp butter, and
  half of the milk. Beat until mixture is smooth. Add remaining milk
  and beat at high speed until smooth and fluffy. Keep warm until ready
  to serve. If desired, place some of potatoes in large pastry bag with
  large star tip. When turnips are tender, drain well and return to
  saucepan. Add remaining 2 Tbsp butter and keep warm until ready to
  serve. To serve, place haggis on serving platter. Spoon, or, if
  desired, pipe several mounds of mashed potatoes around haggis leaving
  space between mounds. Spoon some of turnips between potato mounds.
  Garnish with lavender, rosemary, and sage, if desired. Pass remaining
  potatoes and turnips. Give each guest a glass of Scotch to pour over
  the haggis or to enjoy with it. If haggis has collagen casing, guests
  may want to remove it from slices before eating. Notes: This classic
  Scottish pudding made from oatmeal, mutton scraps, and suet is
  traditionally baked in a sheep's stomach. Today, butchers often use
  collagen casings while homemakers frequently opt to bake the mixture
  in a casserole. Mashed potatoes (tatties) and turnips (neeps) are the
  traditional accompaniment to haggis, as is a glass of Scotch whiskey,
  which is either poured over the pudding or enjoyed with it. To serve
  this traditional dinner, you can purchase a haggis by mail or prepare
  our Americanized Homemade Haggis (separate recipe). Source: Country

  Jewish, Pileggi, Persia
      1/4 c  Almonds
      1/4 c  Pistachio nuts
      1/4 c  Walnuts
      1/4 c  Pumpkin seeds
      1/4 c  Hazelnuts
      1/8 c  Pitted dates, coarsely Chopped
      1/8 c  Light and dark raisins
      1/8 c  Dried apricots, coarsely Chopped
      1/8 c  Prunes, chopped
      1/8 c  Aloo bukhara (dried apricots With seeds)
      1/8 c  Dried seeded cherries, Coarsely chopped
      1/4 c  Red wine
        2 t  Wine vinegar
      1/4 t  Advieh; see recipe
      1/4 t  Rosewater
  
  1.  Coarsely chop the nuts in a processor.  Mix the nuts, fruits,
  wine, vinegar, Advieh, and rosewater to achieve a moist, textured
  consistency.
  
  VARIATIONS:  For fresh fruit halek, use apples, pears, pineapples,
  plums, and grapes -- as much variety as is available -- an equal
  amount of each when cut into very small pieces. Mix with the wine,
  vinegar, Advieh, and rosewater in the proportions noted for the dried
  fruit and nuts.
  
  Halek is a word also used in Kurdistan and India to denote the
  ceremonial mixture presented on the table at the Passover Seder. The
  Ashkenazi haroseth is used for the same purpose, but the combination
  of ingredients is more complex. There are several types of Persian
  halek -- the combination of nuts, fruits, wine, and spices --
  depending upon the family custom.

      Title: HALF MOON BAY PUMPKIN BREAD
 Categories: Quick bread
      Yield: 3 Loaves
 
      3 c  Sugar, granulated
  3 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Nutmeg
      4 lg Eggs
      1 c  Vegetable oil
      2 c  Pumpkin (cooked)
    2/3 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
           Cream cheese (optional;
           -for serving)
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Butter your containers well.
  
  Sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl. Make a well in
  the center of the dry ingredients, and add the eggs, oil, pumpkin and
  water. Beat thoroughly. It's easier to get all the lumps out if you
  use an electric mixer. Stir in the walnuts with a wooden spoon.
  
  Pour the batter into the containers, filling each only half to
  two-thirds full.  Bake for 60-90 minutes, depending on the sizes of
  your containers. If you're using a very small container, start
  checking much sooner. The bread is done when a toothpick in the
  middle comes out clean.
  
  Cool about ten minutes, then loosen the edges of the bread with a
  knife, and turn out of the pans to cool the rest of the way on a
  rack. For baking containers, you can use a loaf pan, metal cans, or
  whatever. I usually use 1-pound coffee cans, and it takes three of
  them. If you want tiny loaves, you could probably use soup cans.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A dessert bread made from pumpkins -- Every year in Half Moon Bay,
  California there is a Pumpkin Festival, at which prizes are given for
  the largest pumpkin in the world. Never mind that for the last two
  years the winner has been in Nova Scotia:  the citizens of Half Moon
  Bay take pumpkins very seriously.
  
  At Christmas time in Half Moon Bay, people give each other little
  tins of this bread as presents. I also take it backpacking, because
  it's pretty resistant to being squashed (and tastes fine even when it
  is). Yield: 3 1-pound loaves.
  
  *  I think the nuts are important in this recipe. Unless you
  absolutely hate them, leave them in.
  
  *  It's not necessary, but you can serve some good cream cheese with
  it to spread on the slices if you like.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 90 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: HALIBUT
 Categories: Info, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  "Hippo of the sea" is the translation of the Latin hippoglossus. "Holy
  flatfish" is the English derivation  hali for holy, but for flat.
  It was a special fish for holy days in Medieval England.
  
  Halibut is a member of the flounder family; specifically the right-eye
  flounder, signifying which side of the flat body the eyes are on.
  Related to soles, sand dabs and other flatfish, the halibut far
  outweighs them all, reaching as high as 500 pounds. Like other
  flatfish, the halibut has skin that is mottled brown on the top side
  to blend into the ocean floor. The bottom, seldom seen by predators,
  is snowy white.
  
  Pacific halibut is vastly more plentiful than Atlantic halibut, which
  is caught in very small numbers and is not commercially significant.
  Nearly all of the Pacific halibut are caught in the North Pacific,
  although they venture as far south as Northern California. California
  has its own halibut called, simply enough, California halibut. It
  looks much like the Pacific halibut but is much smaller.
  
  Halibut flesh should be translucent, shiny white. When halibut are
  frozen, they are generally frozen whole, which maintains the flesh at
  a peak of quality. Carefully frozen halibut, when thawed and
  portioned, should have the same translucent look that fresh does.
  Flesh with a milky, opaque white color, blotches or yellowish tinges
  indicates poor freezing or handling.
  
  Halibut is sold in the form of steaks or fillet pieces. Steaks,
  crosscut sections of the fish, vary widely in size since the fish is
  broad in the middle and tapered at the ends. Halibut fillets are
  always boneless. Steaks generally have bones, but end pieces do not.
  
  In 1993, about 30,000 tons of Pacific halibut was caught in Alaska,
  British Columbia, and down the West Coast. Over 90 percent of the
  Pacific catch comes from the Gulf of Alaska.
  
  With halibut now being caught from the spring to the fall, fresh
  halibut is more commonly available. Frozen halibut will still be
  available and is a very good alternative. Spring, early summer and
  early fall should be the most abundant seasons, so prices should be
  most reasonable then.
  
  For a lean fish, halibut has a pleasantly distinctive flavor.
  However, it is still mild enough to adapt well to a wide variety of
  flavor combinations. Like many other fish, halibut is very versatile
  in the kitchen. It has the added characteristic of firm flesh that
  holds together well, so it is even more adaptable than delicate white
  fish. Try marinating it before cooking to enhance its lean, mild
  flavor.
  
  Halibut is a lean fish with good nutritional balance. Each 3 ounce
  serving contains 110 calories, 2.3 g total fat, .3 g saturated fat,
  32 mg cholesterol, 54 mg sodium and 21 g protein.

  pepper. Grill the halibut over medium-hot coals for 5-8 minutes
  depending on thickness of steaks. Brush with butter mixture
  occasionally. Turn and baste with the remaining butter mixture. Grill
  the halibut until it flakes easily with a fork, 5-8 minutes more.
  Sprinkle halibut with paprika and serve with chilled cucumber sauce.

  pepper. Grill the halibut over medium-hot coals for 5-8 minutes
  depending on thickness of steaks. Brush with butter mixture
  occasionally. Turn and baste with the remaining butter mixture. Grill
  the halibut until it flakes easily with a fork, 5-8 minutes more.
  Sprinkle halibut with paprika and serve with chilled cucumber sauce.

    1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
      6 tb Butter; (yah. right.)
      3 tb Lemon juice
    1/8 ts Tabasco
 
  (For a six oz (raw) steak, I used 2 small Tomatoes, kept the green
  pepper and onion the same, threw in a chopped jalopena pepper,
  replaced the 6 tbsp of butter with 1 tsp margarine, and used about a
  tsp of Tabasco).
  
  Preheat the oven to 400F. Butter a shallow baking dish large enough
  to hold the fish in one layer, and place the fish in it. Season with
  salt and pepper to tasted and spread the tomatoes, green pepper, and
  onion over the top. Melt the butter with the lemon juice and Tabasco
  and drizzle it over the fish and vegetables. Bake about 25 minutes,
  basting with pan juices every
       10    minutes.
  
  (My way, without the butter, with a 4 oz (cooked) portion of the
  fish, and about two-thirds of the vegetables, I counted it as 4
  protein choices and 1 Fruit/Vegetable choice).

  Recipe by: Martin Golding <martin@PLAZA.DS.ADP.COM> Heat butter in
  frying pan until foaming subsides, reduce heat to medium to medium
  low and fry fish five minutes per side, being careful when you turn
  not to break it up.
  
  While fish is frying, combine sauce ingredients.
  
  When fish is done, remove to plates or serving platter. Deglaze pan
  with th sauce, stirring briskly until it begins to thicken just
  slightly. Pour sauc decorously over the fish, and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  Other mild, tasty vinegars could be substituted. If all you have is
  wine or cider vinegars, use two Tbs of that and two Tbs of some kind
  of unsweete fruit pulp or juice.
  
  Since you don't have muscadine wine, substitute a dry
  gewurtztrameiner or maybe a riesling- anything dry, with a spicy or
  fruity flavor.
  
  Other thick, firm fish ought to do. Fry it five minutes per side per
  inch of thickness.

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
     12    New potatoes, cooked &
           -buttered
 
  * BOUQUET GARNI - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
  sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
  thyme.  Leave the string long enough to hang the garni in the pot and
  tie the string to the pot handle for easy removal. ** Beurre Manie is
  used to thicken sauces.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter on a
  small flat plate and blend the mixture with a fork into a very smooth
  paste. Roll the paste into a ball. Wipe the mushrooms with damp paper
  towels. Remove the stems and add them to the fish stock. Heat the
  stock, simmer it for 15 minutes and reserve.  Poach the olives in
  boiling water over low heat for 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and
  set aside. Dip the halibut steaks into milk for 2 or 3 minutes. Dry
  them with paper towels. Season the fish steaks with salt and pepper
  and lightly dredge them in flour, shaking off the excess. In a large
  skillet melt the butter and 2 T of oil. Add the fish steaks and brown
  them well on one side. Turn them carefully with a large spatula and
  brown them on the other side. Carefully remove the fish to a side
  dish. To the fat remaining in the pan add the shallots. Cook over low
  heat until they are soft but not browned. Add the tomatoes, salt,
  pepper, Bouquet Garni and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil and
  add tomato paste and the fish stock. Return the fish steaks to the
  skillet. Cover it tightly and simmer on top of the stove for 20 to 25
  minutes, or until the fish flakes easily. Carefully remove the steaks
  to a serving platter. While the fish steaks are cooking, heat
  remaining oil in a skillet. Add the mushrooms and cook them over high
  heat until they are nicely browned. Do not overcook. Remove the
  skillet from the heat and reserve. When the fish steaks are done,
  remove them carefully to a serving platter. Strain the sauce,
  pressing down well on the tomato pulp to extract all the juice.
  Return the sauce to the pan and reduce it by 1/3 over high heat. Add
  a Beurre Manie, a little at a time, whisking constantly until the
  sauce heavily coats a spoon.  Add the mushrooms and olives, salt and
  black pepper.  Remove the sauce from the heat. Remove any accumulated
  juices around the fish steaks with paper towels. Pour the sauce over
  the fish steaks, and keep them warm until serving time. Combine the
  parsley, garlic and lemon rind and sprinkle the mixture over the fish
  steaks just before serving.  Serve the fish steaks with the optional
  buttered new potatoes.

        1 md eye of Cyclops (onion)
       15 oz Can soft shelled beetles
  :          (kidney beans)
       28 oz Can blood of bat (V-8 juice)
      1/8 ts pureed wasp (prepared
  :          mustard)
      1/4 ts common dried weed (oregano)
        1 ds Redtailed hawk toenails
  :          (crushed red
  :          pepper)
        2 ts ground sumac blossom (chili
  :          powder)
        1 ts hemlock (honey or sugar)
      1/2 c  fresh grubs (sliced celery)
        1 TB eye of Newt (pearled
  :          barley)
        1 TB dried maggots (uncooked
  :          rice)
  :          Water from a stagnant pond
  :          (tap water)
  
  Preparation : Substitutions are in parenthesis. Best made during the
  last phase of the moon, if that is not possible, just do the best you
  can in a softly lighted kitchen after dark. Brown the gizzards in an
  iron cauldron over a fire made from the siding off of a haunted
  house, add chopped eye of cyclops and simmer until the pieces of eye
  become translucent again, add blood of bat, and soft shelled beetles,
  bring to a slow bubbling boil. At this time, add the common weed,
  maggots, toenails, sumac, grubs, hemlock, eye of newt and the pureed
  wasp. As it cooks you may want to adjust the consistency with pond
  water. You can tell it is done when the eye of newt swells and the
  vertical tan colored 'cats eye' appears on one side.

  :          EFFECTS:--
  
  Preparation : In bowl, mix 3 tablespoons cornstarch and 1 tablespoon
  flour. Gradually stir in 3/4 cup Karo corn syrup and 1/4 cup water
  until smooth. This amount will make up 4 children's faces. Divide
  mixture between 4 paper cups. Color 3 batches with food colors of
  your choice (1/2 teaspoon liquid or 1/4 teaspoon paste for each
  batch). Leave 1 batch untinted.
  
  For additional colors, prepare more makeup.  Separate tissues into
  single layers; tear lengthwise into 2-inch wide strips. Using swabs
  or brush, paint generous coat of untinted mixture on forehead; place
  strip of tissue over area; pat firmly with fingertips. Brush on more
  of same mixture to cover any dry spots on tissue. Continue painting
  rest of face, one area at a time, and covering it with tissue.  Don't
  paint eyelids or around eyes. Let dry about 15 minutes; time depends
  on temperature and humidity.
  
  Stir colored batches before using.  Paint on 1 color at a time as
  desired. Let dry slightly before using another color if you want them
  to blend, or let dry completely if you don't. To speed process, use
  hair dryer on air setting.
  
  For deeper, smoother, candy-color effect, use several coats of same
  color (allow to dry slightly between coats).
  
  TO BUILD UP EYEBROWS, nose or chin (or for beard) apple cotton to
  damp, untinted mixture.  Paint with more of the same. Cover with
  tissue and paint desired color.
  
  FOR GHOULISH EFFECT, dust made-up face with flour.
  
  FOR WARTS, stick on Puffed Wheat cereal with untinted mixture, then
  coat with layers of mixture-soaked tissue. Paint desired color.
  
  TO REMOVE MAKEUP, wet face, then gently peel tissue away. Wash face
  with warm water.

  Okay, first the drinks. Easiest is to mix something yellow with
  something blue.  Orange juice and Mountain Dew are good for the
  yellow, Great Bluedini kool-aid is good for the blue. You'll end up
  with a radioactive shade of green.  If you're using a punch bowl, try
  this: Get some of those latex gloves, fill them with water or juice,
  freeze. Unmold carefully and float the disembodied hands in the punch
  bowl. Dry ice and back lighting is good for effect too

 Categories: Cakes, Kids, Holidays
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      2 pk Cake mix, prepared
      2 cn White frosting
           Food coloring
      1    Hostess Ho-Ho (or similar
           -cake-roll snack item)
 
  This is actually more a method than a recipe, but given the recent
  requests for Halloween goodies I thought it might be of interest. I
  originally saw this in Parents Magazine about two years ago.  It has
  been a favorite for our family celebrations since then!
  
  Prepare two cakes in bundt pans, cool completely. Color most of the
  frosting a deep orange, reserving about 1/2 c , which should be
  colored black (you may also use dark chocolate fudge frosting). Place
  one bundt cake upside down (rounded side on the bottom) on cake
  plate; frost top only.  Place second bundt cake flat-side down on top
  of first cake. Frost entire cake with orange frosting, making up and
  down motions with spatula to simulate pumpkin. Insert Ho-Ho in the
  middle of the top of the bundt cake to make the stem. Use black
  frosting to make eyes, nose, mouth, etc. Black rope licorice may also
  be used.

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 pk Blue jelly powder [170g]
      8 c  Lemonaide
 
  Lemonaide or "Goulade" really packs a punch when you float a
  frightening , ghostly blue hand in your serving bowl. For an even
  scarier effect, use red jelly powder to make a blood-red hand and
  tint the lemonade green. If you want, just let the gelatin set in a
  flat container, then cube it and serve with lemonade in dishes.
  
  Dissolve powder in 1-1/2 cups boiling water; let cool slightly.
  
  Meanwhile, thoroughly wash and dry inside and outside of new,
  medium-size stretch latex (medical) glove. Spray outside with baking
  spray; turn inside out. With 6-inch or longer skewer, puncture glove
  just below 1 side of opening; push skewer through to pierce opposite
  side, leaving wide opening. Suspend in tall pitcher.
  
  Carefully pour gelatin mixture into hanging glove. Close top with
  twist tie between gelatin mixture and skewer. Refrigerate for at
  least 2 hours or until firmly set. [Glove can be refrigerated for up
  to 48 hours.]
  
  Place glove flat in 12-cup punch bowl. Using scissors and bring
  careful not to puncture gelatin, cut glove open along palm and each
  finger; gently turn over and remove glove. Pour lemonade over gelatin
  hand.
  
  Makes 8 cups or 12 servings.

      3    Whole cloves
      1    Lemon (peel only)
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 c  Coarse semolina or farina

  Combine the water, sugar, cinnamon stick, cloves, and lemon peel (or 1
  tablespoon lemon juice) in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil
  for 10 minutes, then cool. Meanwhile, slowly melt the butter in a
  heavy saucepan, and cook for several minutes, without browning.
  Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly add the semolina or
  farina. Cook over low heat until the mixture turns a golden chestnut
  color; do not brown. Add 2 tablespoons of the pine nuts and chopped
  almonds and continue cooking 1 more minute. Remove cinnamon stick,
  cloves, and peel from the cooled syrup. Gradually add the syrup to
  the semolina mixture, stirring with a long-handled wooden spoon; the
  mixture will bubble furiously. Cook over the lowest possible heat
  until the syrup has been absorbed and the mixture thickens. Remove
  from the heat and drape with a clean towel for 10 minutes. Turn into
  a mold, spreading with a knife or a spatula. Cool, then reverse onto
  a serving platter, sprinkle with cinnamon, and garnish decoratively
  with the remaining pine nuts and the whole almonds. Cut into small,

      Title: HALVAS POLITIKOS
 Categories: Desserts, Greek
      Yield: 1 Dessert
 
      1 c  Olive oil
      2 c  Semolina
      3 c  Sugar
      4 c  Water
           Cinnamon, powdered
 
  Dissolve the sugar in the water and bring it to a boil. At the same
  time, brown the semolina in the oil on high heat, stirring
  continuously.
  
  When the semolina has taken a golden brown colour, add the syrup into
  it (taking care not to burn your hands), turn down the heat and keep
  stirring until you get a kind of thick porridge. Pour into any kind
  of mold you can think of (a cake-mold is perfect for the job), and
  let it cool.
  
  Unmold into a platter and sprinkle with cinnamon. Slice it using a wet
  knife, serve, and watch your weight go sky high!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Greek dessert with semolina -- This is a traditional greek
  dessert that is extremely about tasty, and as easy to make as
  1-2-3-4. Tasty. Yield: fills a cake-mold.
  
  *  You should be very careful pouring the syrup into the browned
  semolina, as it is extremely hot, and pouring water on it causes an
  eruption of scaldingly hot steam.
  
  *  You should not put this dessert in the refrigerator. It can keep
  for a few days outside the refrigerator, assuming you can gather
  enough will power not to eat it all at once. Some oil will start to
  drain off after a day or so, but this is to be expected. Just make
  sure you don't leave the dessert on your favourite tablecloth!
  
  *  The recipe doubles, halves etc.  nicely as long as you keep the
  proportion of the ingredients.
  
  *  I have seen variations on this dessert using any kind of fat
  imaginable, ranging from cooking fat to olive oil or butter, though
  I've only tried it with olive oil.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15-20 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients, except for the sugar which you
  can adjust to taste.

      Title: HALWA SHEBAKIA (RAMADHAN SPECIAL SESAME COOKI
 Categories: Cookies, Moroccan, Holiday, Quantity
      Yield: 1 Hundreds!
 
      4 lb Flour
      3 lb Butter
      2 lb Sesame seeds;plus additional
           -toasted seeds for sprinklng
      1 tb Dry yeast dissolved in
           -1/2 cup water
     20 g  Gum arabic; optional
      1 tb Saffron stamens
    1/2 lb Smen; seasoned butter
      1 tb Cinnamon, ground
      1 qt Vegetable oil
      1 qt Vegetable oil; for frying
     10 lb Honey
 
  "This recipe is frankly for historical purposes as its yield indicates
  suitability for commercial or restaurant production rather than home
  baking. With unusual proportions of butter, oil and honey in the
  batter, yeast for rising and more oil for frying, making the cookies
  would be rather daunting were it not for the fact that they help
  glorify a particularly holy celebration."
  
  1. In a food processor process all the ingredients, except the honey,
  into a paste.
  
  2. Take a walnut-sized piece of paste and roll it out very thin.
  Using a metal cut-out typically found in Morocco, with different
  designs, cut out cookies and let them rise for 15 minutes. Deep-fry
  the cookies in the remaining quart of oil in batches over low heat
  just to brown.
  
  3. Soak the cookies in the honey for 15 minutes. Remove and sprinkle
  with toasted sesame seeds.
  
  Makes several hundred cookies.

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 tb Drippings from 4 half-inch
           Baked ham steaks
    1/4 c  Firmly packed *light* brown
           Sugar
    1/2 c  *strong* fresh-brewed black
           Coffee
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman HAM & REDEYE GRAVY Remove
  the ham steaks from their fry-drippings and measure out 4 tbsp. of
  the fat. Dispose of the rest. Stir the sugar into the pan at LOW
  heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves. Add the coffee,
  and simmer until the gravy turns a rich brown (maybe 5 minutes or
  so). DO NOT ALLOW THE GRAVY TO BOIL! Pour the gravy over the ham and
  serve.
  
  (NOTE): If you're using uncooked slices of a salty, dry-cured ham,
  add a cup of water to the skillet along with the ham. The ham will
  absorb all the water by the time it's cooked through. Add more water
  if the original amount is absorbed too quickly.
  
  If you're using salt pork, or pork belly fat (like bacon, but
  unsmoked), be sure to blanch it before using. To blanch, cover with
  cold water, bring to a boil, simmer 3 minutes, then drain. Fry a
  little chunk, and if it's still too salty, blanch it again.

      1 lb Ham, diced
    1/4 ts Allspice

      1 lg Can tomatoes
      4 c  Raw rice
      6 c  Beef or chicken stock
      1 bn Green onions, chopped
      4    Cloves garlic, chopped
 
  Slice the sausage and fry it up in the oil (preferably in a big cast
  iron pot) until it is brown.  Then add the ham. Stir the ham and
  sausage mixture while chopping the onions, peppers and celery. Then
  add these vegetables to the pot and cook until they are tender. Nest,
  add the tomatoes and cook a few minutes more. Add the stock, bring to
  a boil and let simmer for 30 minutes.
  
  While the food is simmering, chop and add the garlic, the bay leaves,
  thyme, chili powder, allspice, cloves, salt, black pepper and cayenne
  pepper. [Unless you have a healthy tolerance for hot food, start off
  with 1 t of cayenne pepper and taste  before adding the rice.]
  
  Now add the rice, bring to a boil and kepp it there for about 3
  minutes. Then cover the pot and set stove to very low heat. After 15
  minutes, stir the jambalaya. If it seems dry, add some more water.
  Put the lid back on and cook for 15-20 more minutes. Add the chopped
  green onions a few minutes before serving.
  
  This makes 8-10 servings.  Also, it freezes very well, so don't be
  afraid to make a lot.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Smoked ham hocks; (or
           A meaty ham bone; or pieces
           -of slab ba
           Rind on)
      2 c  Dried black-eyed peas; (1#)
      1 c  Onions; coarsely chopped
      2 md Celery stalks; trimmed of
           -all leave
           Chopped
      1    Fresh hot red chili; about
           Chopped
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Place the ham hocks in a heavy 4 to 6 quart pot and add enough water
  to cover the meat by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat,
  reduce the heat to low and simmer partially covered for 2 hours, or
  until the ham hocks are tender and show no resistance when pierced
  deeply with the point of a small skewer or sharp knife.
  
   In a sieve or colander, wash the black-eyed peas under cold running
  water until the draining water is clear. Add the peas, onions,
  celery, chili and a few grindings of black pepper to the pot, mix
  well, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low and
  simmer partially covered for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the peas are
  tender. Check the pot from time to time and add more boiling water if
  necessary. When the peas are fully cooked, they should have absorbed
  almost all of the pan liquid.
  
   Taste for seasoning and serve at once from a heated platter or bowl.
  
   NOTE: The volatile oils in fresh hot chilies may burn your skin or
  make your eyes smart, so clean, stem and seed them under running
  water. Wear rubber gloves if you can and be careful not to touch your
  face or eyes. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water.

  BTW, if you crack the pot, it can be repaired by using two part epoxy
  which will withstand the oven heat okay. Sale's book recommends
  Elmer's Two Part Epoxy, but I wouldn't hesitate to use another brand
  if that one isn't available.

  wrap. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put
  edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies directly
  on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with
  freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last
  date the food should be used for best eating quality (about 6
  months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before stacking
  packages.

 Categories: Penndutch, Ham
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Ham, smoked
      1 x  Water
      1 qt String beans
      5 ea Med Potato
      1 x  Salt & pepper
 
  *** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a
  whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours
  if using a cooked ham. Cover the piece of ham with cold water and set
  over a low flame to cook for 3 hours. Add water from time to time
  during cooking in order to have at least one quart of broth at all
  times. Wash and clean the string beans, break into small pieces and
  add to the ham. Continue cooking about 25 minutes. Pare and quarter
  the potatoes; add to the beans and ham and cook about 25 or 30
  minutes, or until beans and potatoes are tender. About 15 minutes
  before serving, add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, providing
  vinegar for those who like the dish strongly flavored. Source:

 Categories: Pasta, Pork, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Fresh egg noodles
    1/2 lb Ham, diced
           Salt
      1 c  Sour cream

  This is one of the most popular German casseroles, especially south
  of the Main Line.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Cook the noodles in salted water and drain; they can also be left
  over from the day before.  Fill a souffle pan with alternate layers
  of ham and noodles; salt lightly and put some of the sour cream and
  some grated cheese over each layer.  The top layer should consist of
  noodles. Dot with little bits of butter and sprinkle with bread
  crumbs.
  
  Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes.
  
  Variations:
  
  This version of the recipe comes from Swabia; feel free to increase
  the proportions of the costlier ingredients (ham, butter, sour cream)
  as your fancy dictates.
  
  In another version of this casserole, the ingredients are all mixed
  together in one bowl, along with 3 eggs, the souffle pan is well
  greased with butter (always recommended), and the contents of the
  bowl transferred to the pan, the proceed as described above.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

   Get a big pot o' water (enough to sink the ham), slow boil the ham
  'til it starts falling off the bone, quarter the spuds, and when
  they're about done, drop in the beans. Season to taste. That's the
  extent of my cooking prowess, try it, it's cheap, and it's easy, and
  it tastes pretty good (to my palate, anyway).

  NOTES: For Panasonic/National machines, use 3 tsp yeast for the 1 1/2
  pound loaf. This bread has a high liquid content, so the top may fall
  during baking. Use a light crust setting. The crust will be somewhat

      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      2 lb Dry navy (pea) beans
      2 qt Boiling water
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Instant minced onions
      1 c  Green pepper -- cut in thin
           Strips
    3/4 c  Butter or margarine
    3/4 c  Unsifted flour
      4 ts Dry mustard
  1 1/2 qt Bean cooking liquid and
           Milk
      8 oz Processed cheddar cheese --
           Shredded (2 cups)
  2 1/2 lb Cooked ham -- diced (8
           Cups)
           TOPPING FOR EACH PAN -----
    1/4 c  Fine dry breadcrumbs
      1 tb Melted butter
 
  Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
  Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
  servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
  served without freezing.
  
  Add beans to boiling water; return to boiling.  Boil beans 2
  minutes;then soak beans 1 hour (or overnight, if preferred).
  
  Add salt to beans.  Cook beans slowly until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
  Drain; save cooking liquid.  Cook onion and green pepper in fat about
  5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in flour and mustard.
  
  Add enough milk to the reserved bean liquid to make 1 1/2 quarts. Add
  the bean liquid and milk slowly to the vegetable mixture. Cook until
  thickened, stirring constantly. Stir in beans, cheese, and ham. Pour
  one-fourth of mixture into each baking pan.  Pack food tightly to
  avoid air pockets.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 375B0 F. (moderate). Mix
  1/4 cup fine breadcrumbs with 1 tablespoon melted butter or margarine
  for each pan which will not be frozen. Sprinkle topping over bean
  mixture in baking pan.  Bake 30 minutes or until crumbs are lightly
  browned.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
  wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
  together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
  food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
  tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
  food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
  immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 375B0 F. (moderate). Remove
  freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Mix 1/4 cup fine breadcrumbs
  with 1 tablespoon melted butter or margarine for each pan. Sprinkle
  topping over bean mixture in baking pan. Bake 1 1/2 hours or until
  edges are bubbly, crumbs are lightly browned, and center is hot.

  NOTES : This recipe is for 24 servings (about 3/4 cup each).
  Directions are given for dividing the prepared food into four parts
  of six servings each. One part may be completely cooked and served at
  the time of preparation. The remaining parts may be frozen. The
  breadcrumb topping is added at the time of serving. You will want to
  have these ingredients on hand when you are ready to use the frozen

  In a small bowl, beat the eggs, egg yolks with the sugar, lemon rind,
  olive oil, vanilla extract and rum. Gradually add enough flour to
  make a rather soft dough. Turn out onto a floured working surface and
  knead for 2 or 3 minutes. Roll very thin. With a pastry cutter or
  sharp knife, cut into strips 1 inch x 4 to 7 inches. Slowly heat the
  oil in a small saucepan. (Oil is at the right temperature when a
  small piece of dough drops into it floats and begins to sizzle.) Fry
  a few strips at a time, twirling them to give them odd shapes until
  they are lightly golden. (Tie the longer pieces into a knot before
  frying them.) Drain and place on a paper towel. When all the ears are
  done, transfer to a large serving dish, sprinkling each layer with
  confectioner's sugar (through a sieve). YIELDS: 2 to 3 dozen

  firm and liquid has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.
  
  In a food processor, combine the prune mixture, apples, walnuts,
  sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest; process until smooth. Transfer to
  a small bowl and set aside. (The filling can be made up to 2 days
  ahead and kept, covered, in the refrigerator.)
  
  To make cookies: In a medium-sized bowl, using an electric mixer on
  medium speed, cream sugar, oil and butter until smooth. Add egg and
  beat until smooth. Add vanilla and beat until blended.
  
  In another medium-sized bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and
  salt. Using a wooden spoon, stir the dry ingredients into the sugar
  mixture until just combined. Gather the dough together into a ball,
  wrap with plastic wrap, and flatten slightly.  Refrigerate for 2 to 3
  hours or overnight.
  
  Line 2 baking sheets with baking parchment or coat with non-stick
  cooking spray. Set aside.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Divide the dough in half. (Refrigerate the other half.) Roll out on a
  lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/2" inch. Using a 2 1/2"
  diameter cookie cutter, cut the dough into circles. Place l/2 tsp. of
  the filling in the center of each circle. Bring the edges together to
  cover the filling, forming a 3-cornered cookie. Pinch the corners
  together to seal. Place about 1 1/2" apart on the prepared baking
  sheets.
  
  Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the tops are golden. Transfer to
  racks to cool.  Repeat with the remaining dough. (Store cookies in an
  airtight container for up to 3 days.  Freeze for longer storage.)

      Title: HAMBURGER BASICS
 Categories: Beef, Barbacue
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
     18 oz Ground chuck -- 85%
      3 lg English muffins
           Freshly ground pepper
           Toppings-----
           Cheese sliced
           Lettuce
           Tomatoes -- sliced
           Onion -- sliced
           Bacon
 
  Use freshly ground beef. Take the ground beef and break it apart in a
  large bowl. Grind the pepper over it and mix with a large fork, I
  find the 2-tined one with the long handle works best. Divide the meat
  into three mounds on waxed paper. Form the mounds into patties. DO
  NOT PRESS it tight, just kind of gather it up and form the patties,
  pressing lightly to form(about 1 to 1 1/2-inches thick). Grill over
  medium high heat until the juices just begin to appear on the top,
  then flip it over and continue cooking for about half the time took
  for the first side. Serve of toasted muffins with whatever toppings
  you like.
  
  If you press the meat tight, you end up with tuff fast-food stype
  burger
  
  I do not use salt in the mixture because it tuffings the meat and
  draws out the juices. Salt can added, if desires, when assembling
  finished burgers.
  
  Other herbs can be added to the meat when mixing, but I find that a
  good burger is one were the meat is left alone and the toppings are
  added later.

      Title: HAMBURGER GRAVEY
 Categories: Hamburger, Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Pepper
      3 md Onions, chopped
      1 lb Ground chuck
  1 1/2 c  Water + 2 Tb
      1    Beef bouillion cube
           Pepper
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Marge Hamburger Gravy Okay... several
  onions, maybe 2 large or three medium, very coarsely chopped. 1 pound
  hamburger, probably ground chuck or leaner. Scramble/brown the
  hamburger and onions together over medium heat, keeping the meat
  chopped as finely as possible, you don't want big clumps in this,
  until meat is cooked, and onion translucent. Drain off the excess
  grease from the meat, trying to leave about a tablespoon or two in
  the skillet. Sprinkle a scant two tablespoons of water over the meat
  mixture, and stir it in well over low to medium heat. Add
  approximately a cup and a half of water, and stir to blend. (You
  might want to toss a bouillion cube in at this point, won't hurt it
  any!) Simmer, stirring, until the "gravy" thickens... Taste and see
  about adding a healthy shake or three of pepper and (if you omitted
  the bouillion cube) a dash of salt. Won't hurt it to stay warm on the
  back of the stove for a while while the potatoes finish boiling, the
  flavor will go into the gravy more that way. Howzat for indefinite?
  But there WAS no recipe...we just made it!

      Title: HAMBURGER PETAL PIE
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      1 c  Onion, chopped
      1 c  Green pepper, chopped
    1/2    Garlic clove, crushed
      2 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 lb Hamburger
    1/3 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Flour
      1    Egg, slightly beaten
      1 lb Biscuits, canned
 
  Saute the onion, green pepper and garlic in the oil until tender then
  add the beef and cook until brown all over. Dump out the grease and
  add about 1/3 cup of water. Add the worchestershire sauce, salt,
  pepper and flour. Simmer until the juice thickens.
  
  Separate the biscuits and brush the edges with the egg. Put the
  biscuits against the sides and bottom of a pie plate so it is
  completely covered.
  
  Stir the rest of the egg into the meat mixture and then spoon the
  meat into the pie shell.  If you wish you can garnish with a few
  tomato wedges. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 450 degrees F. for about
  8 to 10 minutes. The biscuits should be slightly browned.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick hamburger dish -- I got this recipe from Judy Halter who
  got it from her sister.  Yield: serves 5.
  
  *  This gets its name because the biscuits around the edge puff up to
  look like the petals around the center of a sunflower. This is a
  great bachelor meal because you can come in from work and make it
  without much effort, time or dish washing. You can play with
  different spices to change the flavor. Some of my friends like to put
  cheese on top before baking it.
  
  *  If you live outside North America, remember that a biscuit is a
  scone.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking

 Categories: Meats, Italian, Holiday, Passover
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Chicken breast (2 halves)
           -ground
      4 ts Olive oil
      1    Egg; slightly beaten
      2 tb Matza meal*
      8 c  Chicken broth
           -salt
           -freshly ground black pepper
      1 ds Nutmeg
  2 1/2 lb Lamb,breast of or rib chops
      2    Garlic cloves; sliced
      2    Parsley, Italian sprigs
           -coarsely chopped
      1 c  -Warm water
      2 lb Spinach,cooked and slightly
           -drained
      4    Matzot;regular, broken into
           -large pieces
 
  * Matza meal and Matzots may purchase in some supermarkets and Jewish
  grocery stores.
  
  (The word Hammin (or Hammim) is derived from the Hebrew adjective Ham
  or warm which describes certain dishes that are kept warm for
  prolonged periods of time...In Pitigliano, however Hammin was the
  classic one-course meal for Passover that both rich and poor used to
  make. The only difference between the versions was the in the cuts of
  meat used. Poor people used breast of lamb..and meatballs made with
  beef(when the cost of ground beef was a fraction of the cost of
  chicken.) People who didn't have to worry about the cost used tiny
  rib chops from baby lamb and chicken balls."
  
  Combine ground chicken, 1 Tbsp olive oil, egg, matza meal and 2 Tbsp
  broth in small bowl. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste and mix
  well. In large pot, place the lamb with remaining oil, sprinkle with
  1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper and lightly brown for 2-3 minutes. Add
  garlic, parsley and 1 cup of warm water. Form many tiny bowls with
  the ground chicken mixture and gently add to pot with lamb. Cover and
  simmer 1 to 1/2 hours. Add spinach and 1 Tsp salt and simmer,
  covered, 15 minutes longer. Transfer the lamb chops, half the spinach
  and most of the gravy to a hot serving dish and keep warm. Add
  remaining broth to pot and bring to a boil. Add matza pieces and cook
  4 to 5 minutes. Turn the heat off and let stand 5 minutes before
  serving as a soup. Serve the lamb and spinach as the main dish.

 Categories: French, Breads, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 tb Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
      1 tb Honey
      4 c  (approx.) unbleached white
           -flour
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
      4 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 c  Cubed ham or pork
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
      2 ts Chopped fresh rosemary OR 1
           -tsp crumbled dried
      2 ts Chopped fresh thyme OR 1 tsp
           -crumbled dried
      2 ts Chopped fresh sage OR 1 tsp
           -crumbled dried
 
  ...This French style loaf can be made from start to finish in a
  little over an hour.  It's a hearty loaf that is delicious sliced and
  lightly toasted and served with soups, stews, and salads...
  
  generous grinding of black pepper
  
  1.  Place the yeast in a large mixing bowl.  Mix in the warm water and
  honey and set aside in a warm spot for about 10 minutes, or until the
  yeast is dissolved and begins bubbling. (If the yeast does not bubble
  it is probably dead. Begin again, using fresh yeast.) Gradually sift
  the flour and salt into the yeast mixture, stirring constantly until
  the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.
  
  2.  Sprinkle some flour over a working surface and gently knead the
  dough for several minutes.  Cut the dough in half and roll out one
  half into a rectangle (like a rectangular pizza) about 14 inches by
  10 inches. Brush the dough with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil.
  Scatter half the ham over the surface, pressing it gently into the
  dough.. Sprinkle half the cheese on top and scatter half the herbs
  and a generous grinding of fresh black pepper over the dough. Using
  your hands, gently roll the dough lengthwise, into the shape of a
  long cigar. Lightly seal the edges of the dough.  Place in a
  well-greased French bread pan (or on a well-greased cookie sheet) and
  cover with a clean tea towel.
  
  3.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
  
  4.  Make the second loaf.  Place the two loaves of bread in a dry
  warm spot and let the sit, covered, for
       15    minutes.
  
  5.  Just before baking, lightly brush the loaves with the remaining 1
  tablespoon of olive oil.  Place in the middle shelf of the hot oven
  and bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until the bread has a golden brown
  crust and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
  
  Serves 8.  Makes 2 loaves.

      Title: HANDLING TURKEY
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  According to an article in the "LA Times", Nov. 23, 1991, there are
  probably more cases of food poisoning, in the US, at least, on
  Thanksgiving than any other day of the year.  This is mainly due to
  improper handling, preparing, and cooking the family turkey. The US
  Dept of Agrigulture offers several iron-clad rules for preparing the
  turkey in such a way as to limit the spread and growth of bacteria in
  the process. They are: *
     Make sure juices from the uncooked bird do not drip onto other
  foods, even in the refrigerator. * Carefully wash everything: hands,
  utensils, sink, etc. that comes in contact with the raw bird. Use
  soap and hot water. *
        Don't defrost a frozen turkey at room temperature. Defrost it
  in the refrigerator, allowing one day in the refrigerator for each 5
  pounds of bird. *
        Don't stuff the bird until just before it goes into the oven.
  Stuff itloosely. *     Don't cook the bird at temperatures less than
  325 F. Long, slow cooking at low temperatures allows bacteria to
  grow. * Don't partially cook the bird the day before and finish
  cooking it Thanksgiving day. Cook it in a single, complete operation.
  You can hasten the cooking process by using commercial oven cooking
  bags, and by cooking the stuffing seperately. * Don't refrigerate a
  whole, cooked turkey. Carve the bird, cover and refrigerate the meat.
  Reheat before serving, making sure the meat and stuffing reach
  approximately 165 F. , steaming hot. * Don't allow the cooked bird to
  stand unrefrigerated for more than 2 hours after removing from the
  oven.  A frequent practice is to carve just enough meat from the bird
  to serve the meal, and to finish carving the remainder of the bird
  later.  Do not let later take too long. * Don't use regular paper
  grocery bags to cover the bird in the oven. Toxins from glue in the
  seams can cause illness.

      Title: HANDY CHINESE TRICKS FOR COOKING A WHOLE DUCK
 Categories: Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Info
 
      1    Information
 
  This is an article from the San Francisco Chronicle by Bruce Cost
  about the Chinese philosophy of cooking duck.
  
  Cooking a duck can be intimidating to home cooks. Unlike chicken,
  there's a layer of fat that can cause problems. When duck is simply
  roasted, it often cooks unevenly, leaving a lot of excess fat. In
  addition, much of the potentially delicious skin is discarded.
  
  Chinese cooks solve these problems by applying two or more cooking
  methods to melt away most of the fat while enhancing the flavor of
  the meat. As a bonus, this technique can produce duck skin that is
  succulently crisp.
  
  For example, a duck may be seasoned and hung overnight in a cool, airy
  place, then steamed, perhaps smoked, and finally fried to a golden
  brown. Or, a duck may be browned over high heat in a wok full of oil
  (which melts away some of the fat), drained, and finally simmered in
  a wine/soy/rock sugar sauce, which is reduced at the end of the
  cooking time to a syrupy glaze.  Sometimes just the skin is stuffed
  with boned duck meat, which has been mixed with glutinous rice or
  barley, mushrooms, Chinese dates, lotus seeds and ham; then the whole
  thing is steamed. The famous Peking Duck, which many rank as one of
  the world's greatest dishes, begins by easing the skin away from the
  meat then pumping in air so the whole duck inflates like a balloon.
  The duck then is scalded in a honey-vinegar mixture and hung
  overnight to dry before being cooked. This dish is not a good choice
  for the home cook because the duck is best roasted suspended in a
  special clay-lined oven. The lacquered-looking ducks that hang in
  Chinese delicatessens, sometimes mistakenly thought to be Peking
  ducks, actually are Cantonese roast ducks. After basting the skins
  and hanging the ducks overnight, they are roasted to golden brown
  perfection ++ a sauce of five-spices, star anise, wine and garlic
  simmering in their cavities. For not much more than the price of an
  uncooked duck, these, by the half or whole, make excellent take-out
  food.
  
  The method that follows for making Sichuan Crispy Skin Duck is
  typical of Chinese duck cookery.  It requires a few steps over a
  couple of days, and two cooking procedures, but it's not difficult -
  although frying a whole duck in a wok full of oil may be a new
  experience.

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Onion,large,chopped
      1 lb Mushrooms,sliced
      1    Butter stick
    1/3 c  Flour
      2 qt Chicken broth
      2 c  Canned pumpkin*
      2 c  Light cream
      3 tb Honey
      2 ts Nutmeg
 
  Before making her name as CNN's sole female sportscaster, Hannah
  Storm was famous for her misadventures in the kitchen. "When I was
  younger, my brothers used to make fun of me," says Storm. "Once, I
  was following this wonderful chocolate-coffee bundt cake recipe, and
  I used a cup of freeze-dried coffee grounds. The joke circulated
  around the family for years, 'I ate a piece of Hannah's cake and was
  up for two days straight'."
  
  Storm has since honed her culinary skills. One dish she's mastered is
  her mother's famous pumpkin soup. "This soup was always a mystery
  soup for anyone outside of the family," says Storm. "My mother never
  liked to tell people what was in it because they probably wouldn't
  try it."
  
  * - not pie filling
  
  In a large soup pot, saute onion and mushrooms in butter for 1-2
  minutes. Remove from heat and stir in flour. Add chicken broth and
  pumpkin. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir
  in cream, honey, nutmeg and serve.
  
  OPTIONAL GARNISH: Sprinkle with croutons or crispy chinese noodles and
  Parmesan cheese.

      2 c  Fresh bean sprouts

           -separated into leaves
 
  "This sublime recipe comes from my mother, a native of Hanoi. She
  always made the beef stock in large quantities++enough for at least 3
  meals++and froze it in batches until needed."
  
  In order to cut the beef into paper-thin slices, freeze the pieces of
  meat for 30 minutes before slicing.
  
  The night before, clean the bones under cold running water and soak
  overnight in a pot with water to cover at room temperature. (This
  will help loosen the impurities inside the bones. When heat is
  applied, these impurities are released and come to the top much
  faster and can be removed, therefore, producing a clear broth.)
  
  Place the beef bones, oxtails and short rib plate in a large
  stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook for 10
  minutes. Drain. Rinse the pot and the bones.
  
  Return the bones to the pot and add 6 quarts of water. Bring to a
  boil. Skim the surface to remove the foam and fat. Stir the bones in
  the bottom of the pot from time to time to free the impurities.
  Continue skimming until the foam ceases to rise.  Add 3 quarts more
  water and bring to a boil.  Skim off all the residue that forms on
  the top. Turn the heat to low and simmer.
  
  Meanwhile, char the clove-studded onions, shallots and ginger
  directly over a gas burner or under the broiler until they release
  their fragrant odors. Tie the charred vegetables, star anise and
  cinnamon stick in a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth.  Add
  the spice bag, parsnips and salt to the simmering broth. Simmer for 1
  hour.
  
  Remove the short rib plates.  Pull the meat away from the bones.
  Reserve the meat and return the bones to the pot. Simmer the broth,
  uncovered, for 4 to 5 hours. Keep an eye on it; as the liquid boils
  away, add enough fresh water to cover the bones.
  
  Meanwhile, slice the beef sirloin against the grain into paper-thin
  slices, roughly 2 by 2-inches in size. Slice the reserved short rib
  meat paper-thin.  Set aside.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the scallions, coriander and half of the
  slice onions.  Place the remaining sliced onions in a small bowl and
  stir in the hot chili sauce. Blend well.
  
  Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain and set
  aside.
  
  When the broth is ready, remove and discard all of the bones. Strain
  the broth through a strainer or colander lined with a double layer of
  dampened cheesecloth into a clean pot. Add the fish sauce and bring
  the broth to a boil.  Reduce the heat and keep the broth at a bare
  simmer. In another pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Drain the
  noodles, then drop them in the boiling water. Drain immediately.
  Divide the noodles among 4 large soup bowls.  Top the noodles with
  the sliced meats. bring the broth to a rolling boil.  Ladle the broth
  directly over the meat in each bowl (the boiling broth will cook the
  raw beef instantly). Garnish with the scallion mixture and freshly
  ground black pepper. Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and the
  accompaniments on the side. Each diner will add these ingredients as
  desired. Yield: 4 servings.

      Yield: 2 Servings

    1/4 c  Harbor Village Chef's BBQ

      1 c  Water (for roasting pan)
           Glazing Sauce

MMMMM------------------------BBQ MARINADE-----------------------------
    2/3 c  Cooking oil
      8    Garlic cloves, peeled and
           -minced
  1 3/4 c  Hoisin sauce
  1 3/4 c  Ground bean sauce
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  "nam yu" (red bean curd
           -"cheese")
    1/2 c  Sesame seed paste

MMMMM-----------------------GLAZING SAUCE----------------------------
 17 1/2 oz Container of maltose sugar
    1/4 c  Hot water
      2 ts Mui Gwe Lo rice wine
 
  Ran across this in the SF paper the other day and, on reading the
  ingredients, knew immediately that this is one for you. In the
  article that accompanied the recipe the author talks about a Chinese
  BBQ oven that the chef who originated this recipe uses.  It's made
  out of stainless steel, five feet tall with a 180,000 BTU burner in
  it! This is something I really need for my kitchen. This looks like a
  full-on, no- nonsense Chinese BBQ.
  
  Most master chefs seldom reveal all their kitchen secrets, but Derun
  Yu shared this recipe for a barbecued pork marinade, adapted for the
  home oven. Armed with a Chinese rice bowl, he assembled the
  ingredients, then poured them into a scale so we would have precise
  measurements.
  
  Versatile Chinese barbecued pork is the "ham" of Chinese cooking. It
  may be sliced and served as an appetizer or entree, or like a
  sandwich, cubed and stuffed in bread dough and steamed into pork
  buns. It's good stir- fried with vegetables, tossed with noodles or
  cooked with scrambled eggs.
  
  Prepare the marinade:  Heat the oil in a wok or saucepan over
  medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and gently fry just until it floats
  to the surface and is golden brown (about 2 minutes). Quickly remove
  the garlic and discard.  Pour the garlic oil into a large mixing
  bowl, let cool.
  
  Stir in remaining ingredients with the garlic oil into a smooth
  sauce. Pour into a glass jar. cool.  If the marinade is covered with
  1/8 inch cooking oil, it will keep in the refrigerator for several
  months.
  
  Yields 5 cups.
  
  Then combine the sugar, salt, rice wine, soy sauce, Barbecue Marinade
  and five-spice powder in a large mixing bowl; mix well. Add the pork
  butt and marinate for about 30 minutes (when using spareribs,
  marinate for 1 hour).
  
  Preheat oven to 500F.  Pour the water into a 10 X 14-inch roasting
  pan. Place the roasting rack in the pan (the rack should not touch
  the water). Remove the meat slices from the marinade and place on the
  rack; reserve the marinade.  Roast for 8 minutes, turn over and roast
  the other side for 8 minutes longer.  Reduce the oven temperature to
  300F. Brush the pork with the reserved marinade; roast for an
  additional 20 minutes on each side. Remove from the oven and let cool
  for 5 minutes.
  
  Slice the pork butt into 1/4-inch slices.
  
  Prepare the glazing sauce:  To soften maltose sugar, place the
  container (uncovered) in a microwave oven at high setting for 1
  minute. Transfer the softened maltose into a double boiler with the
  water and rice wine; stir until the glaze is well mixed.  Keep the
  sauce warm until ready to use.
  
  Makes 2 cups.
  
  Then spoon a few tablespoons of the glaze over pork before serving.
  NOTE: Hoisin sauce, ground bean sauce, nam yu, maltose sugar and
  sesame seed paste are available in Chinese markets.

      2 c  Cane sugar
    2/3 c  Light Karo
    3/4 c  Water
      1 ts Oil flavor* & color
      1 ts Or more citric acid**
 
  Have color/flavor/citric acid ready when finished cooking! *More or
  less, some flavors are stronger than others. **Put citric acid in
  fruit-flavored candies for tartness. TEST YOUR THERMOMETER EVERY DAY!
  To test: Place it in cold water & bring to boil. If water boils at-
  say 210 instead of 212, reduce cooking time 2 degrees. ***I use a
  TAYLOR thermometer. Wilton sells them now. Spray *PAM in molds & on
  surface. Not too much & only once per session. USE A THIN PAN, NOT
  HEAVY! Candy must set a few minutes in the pan & the temp will rise,
  burning the candy in a thick pan. Bring mixture to boil. Put lid on
  for 3 minutes <to wash down sugar crystals>, add thermometer & DON'T
  STIR. When therm. reaches 285-290D. remove pot from stove.Wait for
  temp. to lower below 260^ before adding color/flavor/citric acid.
  <Will cook flavor out if too hot.> Cover pan after adding citric acid
  so it won't fade the taste. I add about 2 ts citric acid.
        DON'T STIR!  Use the tiny viles of Lorann oils. Avail. in cake
  supply shop or drug store.
   I pour the cooked candy into a GUTTMAN candy funnel <holds entire
  recipe.> Thats the quickest way to get it in molds befor it cools &
  hardens. *Of course, spray funnel! I pour some into molds & the rest
  onto my marble slab. The part on the slab: I roll it into a long
  cylinder & cut into "pillows" w/scissors. Dust finished candies with
  powdered sugar so they won't "melt" together. There is one very nice
  sucker mold. It is a white ring w/ a slit for the stick. <Don't spray
  stick.> All you do is spray mold, add stick, fill w/candy, cool &
  remove easily Comes in 2-3 sizes, round or heart-shaped. I beleive it
  is Guttman Brand & available here at Sugarcraft. About 2 dz in a
  pack. This is my kids favorite Christmas candy. You will want to make
  several flavors. Experiment on how-much flavor. All vary. *Don't add
  too much on the mints. Takes more on the
  cherry/strawberry/lemon/orange, etc. There are at least 50 oil
  flavors available to choose from! Shared by Dolores McCann, Hamilton

  A large eggs, allow 3,4 or 5 minutes for a soft, medium thick or firm
  yolk; For Extra large 1/2 minute longer; for a Medium egg 1/2 minute
  less. 4.  If eggs cannot be served immediately DIP in cold water to
  stop cooking, otherwise they continue to cook when removed from hot
  water. 5. To hard cook eggs allow 25 minutes for large adding
  approximiately 3 minutes more for Extra large or deducting 3 minutes
  for Medium size. Allow less cooking time for small eggs. Chill in
  cold water.
  
  **************TO TEST HARD-COOKED EGGS******************
  
  A trick to use when hard-cooking eggs, if you forget to time them, is
  to insert a toothpick or small skewer through egg shell to centre of
  yolk. If pick comes out clean, egg is hard-cooked, otherwise sprinkle
  hole liberally with salt and continue cooking until done.

 Categories: Breads, Biscuits, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Van Geffen VGHC42A
           MIXTURE
      1    Box Kellogg's Bran Flakes --
           (1 ounce) (1-serving
           Size)
      1 tb Cinnamon
      2 tb Brown sugar -- packed
      2 tb Butter -- melted
           BISCUIT DOUGH
  2 1/2 c  Bisquick
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Dark raisins
    1/3 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  Tonic water
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  MIXTURE-Empty the box of cereal into blender. Dump in cinnamon and
  brown sugar and use high speed, on/off, for about 3 seconds or till
  crumbled, but not powdered. Empty into small bowl. Stir in melted
  butter with fork till mixture is completely softened. Set aside.
  BISCUIT DOUGH-Use a 2-qt mixing bowl. Stir biscuick together with
  sugar and raisins. Putbuttermilk, Tonic water and vanilla into
  measuring cup, without stirring and pour into Bisquick mixture. Use
  fork to mix until all of the liquid is absorbed. Then knead in the
  bowl with hands, dipping into additional Bisquick, to make dough
  smooth and no longer stick. Break dough up into 4 or 5 portions in
  the bowl - sprinkling the "Flake" mixture over the dough and then
  working it into your hands till most of it is pretty well evenly
  distributed throughout the dough. You want more to "marbelize" the
  dough than you do "mix"it into it. Divide dough into 12 equal parts
  and shape each into 1/2" thick patty, arranging close togethe r in
  Pam-sprayed 12" rouond or oven-proof skillet (or use 2 8" round layer
  cake pans). Bake at 400~ for 25 minutes or until evenly golden.
  Remove pan to wire rack and wipe tops with icing at once using the
  following recipe. ICING-In small bowl with electric mixer on high
  speed, beat 2 tb melted butter, 1 ts vanilla, 2 tb sour cream, dash
  of salt and 1-1/2 c powdered sugar until smooth.Place a rounded tb of
  icing atop each biscuit right out of the oven. The heat of the
  biscuit will soften the icing just enough that you can swirl it
  around to coat the tops nicely, letting the icing stand on thewarm
  biscuits half a minute before spreading it. Refrigerate any leftover
  icing in covered container to use within 2 weeks or freeze to use in
  6 months.

      Title: HARDEE'S FRENCH FRIES
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 c  Vegetable oil
    1/3 c  Granulated sugar
      2 c  Warm water
      2 lg Russet potatoes
           Salt to taste
 
  1) Heat the oil in deep saucepan over low-med. heat for abt. 20 min.
  2) In med. bowl, mix sugar into water until dissolved. 3) Cut
  potatoes in half lengthwise, and then into 1/4" strips. 4) Put
  potatoes into the sugar solution and soak for 15 min. 5) Remove
  potatoes and dry thoroughly on paper towels. 6) The right oil temp.
  in crucial. To test oil, fry a couple of potato slices for 6 min.
  Remove and cool, then taste. The fries should not get too dark too
  soon and should be soft in the middle. If oil is too hot, turn it
  down and test again. The fries should not be under cooked,either. If
  they are, turn up heat. 7) When oil temp. if just right, put all of
  the potatoes in the oil for 1 min. This is the blanching stage. 8)
  Take fries out of the oil and let them cool. 9) When the fries have
  cooled, place them into the oil again for 5 min., or until golden
  brown. 10) Remove from oil and place on paper towels to drain. Salt
  to taste.
  
  Yield: 4 to 5 dozen french fries
  
  Oil temp. is critical in cooking these french fries. Be sure to test
  the oil on several potato slices before cooking large portions. And
  keep in mind that the more your cook at once, the longer your cooking
  time may be.
       The blanching stage may seem to be a nuicance, but it is crucial
  if you want your fries to come out right. Blanching allows the fries
  to soak up a little oil while cooling, and wil make them crispy when
  done.

      Title: HARDNECK GARLICS
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Text Only
 
  These have a central flower stalk that hardens to a stem in the
  center of the garlic head. Tricky to grow and generally much less
  productive than "softneck" garlics, they are always more expensive.
  Examples include:
  
  Rocambole. This is the most commonly planted specialty variety. The
  head is cone-shaped, with bright purple skin. The uniformly sized,
  wedge-shaped cloves are clustered radially around the central stalk.
  The cloves easily pop out of their papery skins. It has a strong
  flavor but is rarely bitter.
  
  Spanish Roja. Similar to the Rocambole, but with a rounded head and
  skin coloration that ranges from red to mahogany. Grown most commonly
  in the Northwest.
  
  Italian Red. A generic name given to red-skinned, hardnecked garlics
  of several different varieties.
  
  SOFTNECK GARLICS
  
  These do not have a central flower stalk. These are always used for
  braiding. These include:
  
  Mexican Pink. A common variety grown in Mexico, it is char- acterized
  by cloves that splinter outwards from the main head, somewhat like
  leaves on an artichoke. The flavor is often quite hot.
  
  Early and Late California White. This is the main garlic variety grown
  commercially in California. It is very productive and is well adapted
  to growing in hot weather. It has tight skins over both the cloves
  and the whole head, which help make this garlic one of the best
  keepers.
  
  Elephant Garlic. A cross between garlic and onion. The flavor is mild
  and the texture is similar to an onion.
  
  Other Useful Terminology
  
  Green garlic. Garlic harvested before the bulb has matured and before
  skins have formed around the cloves. It can be used like baby leeks.
  The flavor is mild but distinctly garlicky.
  
  Fresh garlic. Juicy, mature garlic sold before the skins have set or
  dried. This is perishable and susceptible to mold.
  
  Cured garlic. Most garlic is cured for about a month to allow the
  skins to dry or set.

           -(optional)
      2 tb Butter
      2    Onions chopped
      8 ct Pods, punctured
      3    2-inch cinnamon sticks
     10    To 15 peppercorns
      8    Cloves
  3 1/2 qt Water
      1 c  Chick-peas soaked
      4    Strips orange rind
    1/2 ts Saffron
      1 ts Turmeric
      1 ts Nutmeg
      2 tb Honey
      1 cc Fresh ginger, sliced
      6    Sprigs parsley
     10    To 15 sprigs cilantro
    1/2 lb Carrots, scraped, cut in
           -chunks

      2    Sweet red peppers, seeded,
           -quartered
           Chopped cilantro for garnish
 
  If using the dried chiles, soak them in a cup of hot water for 1
  hour, then drain.  Pound or mince the chiles, garlic and salt into a
  paste. Mix all or some of this paste, according to the degree of
  hotness desired, with the broth, and serve hot, garnished with the
  cilantro.
  
  Aromatic Broth:
  
  Put the chicken parts, turkey neck and giblets, butter, onions,
  cardamom, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns and cloves into a heavy pan.
  Cover and cook over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Before the mixture begins to brown, add the remaining ingredients
  (except chopped cilantro).  Cover and simmer for 1 hour, skimming off
  as much fat as possible. Raise the heat to medium and let the broth
  cook, uncovered, for 1 hour.  The broth should reduce to about 7 cups
  during this time. Season with salt and remove from heat.
  
  Remove the pieces of chicken and discard.  Strain the broth through a
  large sieve set over a large bowl, pressing against the vegetables.
  Set aside 3 cups broth to make the harissa sauce. Serve the
  remainder, piping hot, garnished with cilantro.

  well browned all over, about 10 minutes. Add stock, sage, and lemon
  juice; stir to scrape browned bits from pan. Cover very tightly and
  bake in a 325'F. oven for 1 hour. 3. Add carrots and potatoes to
  meat. Cover and bake until vegetables are barely tender when pierced,
  about 20 minutes. Add turnips and parsnips; cover and bake until all
  vegetables are tender when pierced, about 40 minutes longer. 4. When
  vegetables are done, place cabbage in a 10-12" frying pan with 1/2"
  water. Bring water to boiling over high heat, cover, and simmer until
  cabbage is tender when pierced, about 10 minutes. 5. Transfer meat
  and vegetables to a large platter; keep warm. Skim fat from pan
  juices; bring juices to a boil over high heat. Add cornstar mixed
  with 1/3 cup water and bring to a second boil, stirring. Pour into a
  small pitcher. Slice meat and serve with vegetables; add gravy and
  salt and pepper to taste.
  
  *** RICH PORK STOCK *** 1. Place reserved pork bones in a 10x15" pan
  with onions and carrots. Roast in a 450'F. oven, mixing occasionally,
  until bones are well browned, 40-50 minutes. 2. Add 1/2 cup water to
  pan; stir vigorously to free browned bits. Scrape mixture into a 5-6
  quart pan. Add 1 quart water, celery, and thyme. Bring to a boil over
  high heat, then cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. 3. Uncover pan and
  boil over high heat until liquid is reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 10
  minutes. Pour mixture through a fine strainer into a bowl. Discard
  bones and vegetables. If stock is made ahead, cool, cover, and chill
  up to 2 days. Skim or lift off fat and discard.

      1/2 lb Almonds, shelled
      1/2 lb Pitted dates
      1/2 lb White raisins

  2.  Prepare balls of the mixture about 3/4-inch in diameter. Put each
  ball on a small square of wax paper.
  
  Serve when wanted during Passover.
  
  Passover is a difficult time for desserts since most sweets are
  "hamatz" or forbidden.  The Moroccan have solved part of the problem
  with these delectable dates and nut balls.

  Great chili to make with friends.  Makes about 16 cups. Substitute
  2-1/2 to 3 cups each white and blanck beans, cooked. Use garbanzos
  instead of navy or white kidney. You may want to add a 2nd bottle of
  Ale to the Chili when it needs it. If you don't like eggplant, or
  can't find it, use 2 zucchini. Need about 3 to 4 cups of diced
  eggplant/zucchini. Ifyou want to make vegetarian chili, omit the
  chicken.
  
  1. Heat oil over low flame in a heavy-bottomed stockpot. Add onion,
  garlic, and spices and cook, covered, until golden, about 15 minutes.
  
  2. Add eggplant and cook, covered, for 15 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  3. Add beans, Harpoon ale, oregano, and tomatoes. Cook, covered, over
  medium heat for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook for 2 to 3
  hours (or less if using already cooked beans), partly covered, making
  sure all beans are completely soft.
  
  4. Add chicken and peppers and cook until just heated.
  
  6. Serve with a dollop of (soft) goat cheese and fresh cilantro.

      Title: HARRIET'S SOUTHERN BISCUITS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour, plus 2 Tablespoons
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      2 tb Crisco
    1/2 c  Buttermilk
      1 tb Crisco, for frying pan
 
  Mix the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Blend in the Crisco
  until the mixture is coarse and grainy. Harriet uses a fork, but I
  have better luck with a pastry blender. Then, using a fork, stir in
  the buttermilk.  Do not overmix.
  
  Put on a floured board and knead just a few times. Pat out the dough
  to about 1/2 inch thick.  Cut with a biscuit cutter or a glass.
  (Flour the cutter.)  Do not handle the dough too much, or it will get
  tough.
  
  Use a heavy black frying pan.  Place the 1 tablespoon of Crisco in the
  frying pan and put the frying pan in the over for about 7 minutes.
  Remove the pan from the oven and place the biscuits in the pan. Turn
  each once in the oil and bake the biscuits at 500 degrees for 10
  minutes, or until light brown.

  desired, over the top, then dot with butter. Cover crust with pastry
  strips in a windowpane pattern. Sprinkle with a little sugar, if
  desired. (The pie also can be covered with cut-out pastry, with a
  full pastry crust or a crust of some other design.)
  
  Bake for 10 minutes.  Lower heat to 350 degrees and cook 40 minutes
  or so, until the topis light brown and the filling is bubbly. Letting

  NOTE: This recipe was resized; follow the directions for your B/M.
   Because I am still so new at this *P BB I wrote my note in the wrong
  place so here goes again!  My bread making is improving, thanks to *P
  and B M Magic! I love the book. On a trip to New England I bought
  bread in a town square, it was wonderful! Later I wrote the baker for
  the recipe and she kindly sent it.  I've only tried it once (I'm new
  to bread making). But now I'd like to try it in my BM.        (the
  directions follow for assembling ingredients, etc. but since I want
  to make it in my BM, I'm not including them.
   Divide dough in two.  Divide each half into 3 and make 3 ropes.
  Braid them and make into a circle. Attach both ends,repeat with other
  half.
  
   The bread was delicious and I would appreciate any help someone can
  give me.  Until later, Renee N.C. San Diego

  Make ahead casserole from Caterer Pat MacKinnon of Pat's Palatables in
  Summerville, SC.
  
  Mix thoroughly the hash browns, onions, cheese, sour cream, soup,
  salt, pepper and 4 ounces of the margarine, melted. Place in a
  greased 3-quart casserole dish. Cover top with breadcrumbs and pour
  remaining 4 ounces margarine over the top. Bake at 350 degrees for
  about 1 hour and 10 minutes. -- MacKinnon also shares a recipe for
  Hash Brown Casserole, a popular side dish that goes with any meat.
  Cooked regular potatoes don't freeze well, she says, but this dish,
  made with frozen hash browns, makes a great keeper in the freezer.
  
  MacKinnon thaws the casserole for about an hour before baking then
  covers it loosely with foil for about half the baking time. The
  casserole is done when it's bubbling and browned on top.

 Categories: Hawaiian, Chef, Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------NORMA WRENN-----------------------------
           For Sabayon:
      2 oz Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate
           -melted
    1/4 c  Sugar
      6    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Lilikoi (passion fruit)
    1/4 c  Water
           Hawaiian fresh fruits:
      2    Papaya
      2    Mangoes; peeled; seeded
     12    Strawberries; cleaned
           -with stems removed; sliced
      4    Sprigs fresh mint leaves
 
  To prepare the fruits:  Peel the papaya, prepare into melon balls and
  set aside.  Take one half of mango and finely sliced lengthwise. Then
  take one twelve-inch plate and start making the design with the mango
  into a triangle leaving the center empty, then add the sliced
  strawberries inside theh triangle in one layer. Add the melon balls
  of papaya in the center. Repeat this for the rest of the plates.
  
  To prepare the sabayon:
  
  Melt the Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate in a medium size bowl over a
  double boiler. When melted turn off the heat. In a separate bowl,
  cream the egg yolks and sugar well but do not beat them. Place the
  bowl in hot water bath, taking great care that the bottom of the bowl
  containing the egg and sugar mixture does not tough the hot bottom of
  the pan beneath. Pour the lilikoi and wate into the bowl of egg yolks
  and sugar, stirring continuously.  The hot water bath should not come
  to a boil but be kept just below simmering point. Now beat the
  mixture energetically with the balloon whish until it froths and has
  doubled in volume and until it is mixted consistenly like a ribbon.
  Pour chocolate into sabayon and mix together.  Serve with Hawaiian
  fruits. Garnish with sprig of mint.

  container, spooning sauce mixture over each layer. Cover tightly and
  marinate 6-12 hours in the 'fridge, stirring occasionally and keeping

      Title: HAZELNUT BISCOTTI
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 36 Cookies
 
      1 c  Hazelnuts (about 4 oz)
    1/4 lb Butter, unsalted, room temp
      1 c  Sugar
      1 lg Lemon, grated zest of
      2    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 c  All purpose flour,
           Plus 2 Tbsp
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  I just made this recipe once, and I substituted toasted sliced
  almonds for the hazelnuts. It was really good. Preheat oven to 350-F.
  Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 8 to
  10 minutes, until fragrant. Place the nuts in a dish towel and rub
  them together to remove some of the skin. Coarsely chop the hazelnuts
  and set aside. In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer,
  beat the butter at medium speed until soft and creamy. Add the sugar
  and lemon zest and beat until the mixture is very light and fluffy,
  about 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then beat in
  the vanilla. In a medium bowl, toss the flour, baking powder and
  salt. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter, beating on low
  speed until a smooth dough forms. Using a wooden spoon, work in the
  hazelnuts until evenly distributed. Divide the dough in half in the
  bowl. With lightly floured hands, form the dough into two 10-by-2
  inch rectangular logs. Place the logs on an ungreased baking sheet,
