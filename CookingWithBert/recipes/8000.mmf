           The pie -- optional
           One 9 inch Pyrex pie pan
 
  Prepare and chill the dough. To make the filling, combine 1 cup of the
  blueberries with the sugar in a nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a
  simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is
  melted and the mixture is very liquid about 5 minutes. Combine the
  cornstarch and water in a small bowl and whisk the blueberry and
  sugar mixture into it. Return everything to the pan and cook,
  stirring constantly, over low heat, until the mixture comes to a
  boil, thickens and becomes clear. If it does not become clear,
  continue to cook over low heat for a few more minutes, until it does.
  Pour into a large bowl and stir in the remaining filling ingredients,
  except the blueberries, then add the remaining 3 cups blueberries.
  Cool. Set a rack at the upper and lower thirds of the oven and
  preheat to 400 degrees. Roll out the bottom crust and arrange in pan.
  Pour the cooled filling into the bottom crust. Prepare a lattice top
  crust. Flute the edge of the pie and carefully brush it with egg
  wash. If you wish, sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar. Place the
  pie in the oven on the lower rack and reduce the temperature to 375
  degrees. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the crust is baked through
  and a deep golden brown and the filling is gently bubbling. If the
  top crust has not colored sufficiently after 30 minutes of baking,
  move the pie to the upper rack of the oven for the last 10 minutes.
  Cool the pie on a rack. Yield: one 9-inch pie
  
  Variation:  top with Almond Crumble topping.

      3 c  Self-rising cake flour
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter
  1 1/4 c  Buttermilk

  adding the remainder if necessary. Press dough together on a floured
  surface, wrap and allow to rest while preparing filling.

  level. Place blueberries in a bowl and add remaining filling
  ingredients, except butter. Toss well to combine and pour filling
  into a 2-quart gratin dish or other baking dish. Distribute pieces of
  the butter evenly on the filling. On a floured surface, with the
  palms of the hands, press out the dough to the size of the baking
  dish and slide a thin cookie sheet under it. Slide the dough onto the
  filling. Cut 3 or 4 vent holes in the crust with the point of a
  knife. Paint the top crust evenly with the buttermilk and sprinkle
  with sugar. Bake the cobbler about 20 minutes, until crust is well
  colored and filling is bubbling. Cool slightly on a rack and serve

      Title: BLUEBERRY LEMON SOUFFLE PIE
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Blueberries, picked over
      6 tb Granulated sugar
      3 lg Eggs, separated
      7 tb Superfine sugar
    1/4 c  (plus 3 tb) fresh lemon
           Juice
           Grated zest of 2 lemons
    1/8 ts Salt
      1    Baked pie shell
 
  Preheat oven to 400F.  In a nonreactive saucepan, toss the
  blueberries and granulated sugar.  Cook over moderately high heat,
  stirring occasionally, until the juices begin to bubble, 3-5 minutes;
  do not overcook or the berries will burst.  Pour into a stainless
  steel strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the drained juices. Using an
  electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 4 tablespoons of the
  superfine sugar until pale and thick, about 2 minutes.  Gradually
  beat in the lemon juice and then the zest. Transfer the mixture to a
  nonreactive saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring, until it
  thickens, about 8 minutes; do not boil. Scrape into a bowl and set
  aside on a rack to cool. Using clean beaters, beat the egg whites
  until foamy. Add the salt and beat until soft peaks form. Add the
  remaining 3 tablespoons superfine sugar, 1/2 tablespoon at a time,
  beating well after each addition. Beat at high speed until the whites
  are glossy but not dry, about 20 seconds longer. Using a rubber
  spatula, stir one-fourth of the beaten whites into the yolk mixture.
  Gently fold in the remaining whites in three additions. Spoon the
  blueberries into the pie shell and drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons of the
  drained juices over them.  Mound the souffle mixture over the
  berries, touching the pie crust all around. Bake in the middle of the
  oven for about 15 minutes, until the top is nicely browned. Transfer
  the pie to a rack to cool slightly.  Serve at warm or at room
  temperature.

  baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.  Add the butter and cut it in with a
  pastry blender until it is broken into very small pieces. Stir in the
  sugar.
  
  In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg, milk, and yogurt together.
  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients; pour in the liquid
  ingredients and stir lightly. When there are only a few traces of the
  dry ingredients visible, fold in the blueberries.
  
  Using about 1/4 cup of the batter for each biscuit, drop evenly spaced
  mounds onto the prepared baking sheet.
  
  Bake for 20 minutes, turning the baking sheet midway through so they
  brown evenly.  Serve warm.
  
  These biscuits look and taste like oversize blueberry oatmeal cookies.
  
  Makes 12 biscuits.

 Categories: Alcohol, Beverages, Mixed drink
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/3    Part Blueberry Schnapps
    2/3    Part Milk
           Blue Cuacao
 
  While on a bus trip for skiing in PA a few years back, we had about
  1/2 a day to waste before boarding the bus to go home. In the ski
  lodge was a bar and while at the bar the bartender made us all what
  he called a blueberry popsickle. It was in a tea type of glass, 1/3
  Bluesburry Schapps and 2/3 milk and enough Blue Cuacao to turn the
  color a light blue. This is poured into a blender with ice and blend
  until you have slush like drink. The bartender said that you could
  use any type of milk that you wanted, powered, skin, and so on. I
  have never found anyone since that has seen or heard of this drink.
  It's great while in the hot tub. The bartender also said that you
  could make peach or what ever type of schnapps you have with the same
  recipe, just sub the Blue Cuacaco with a liqueur that will give you
  the desired color.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Sausage, pork
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Sugar, brown
      2    Eggs
      8 oz Sour cream
      1 c  Blueberries
    1/2 c  Pecans, chopped
 
  Day before: Cook sausage and drain well.  Stir together flour, baking
  powder, and baking soda.  In large mixing bowl, beat butter until
  fluffy. Add sugars and beat until well-blended. Add eggs, one at a
  time, beating well after each.  Alternate adding flour mixture and
  sour cream to creamed ingredients; mix well. Fold in sausage and
  berries. Pour batter into ungreased 13"x9"x2" baking pan.  Sprinkle
  pecans on top. Refrigerate overnight.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Bake 35-40 minutes, until done. Cool on wire
  rack.
  
  Sylvia's notes:  With two young kids, I didn't want to use chopped
  nuts, so I sprinkled raw oats on top. Then, I didn't have a 13"x9"
  pan, so used two 8"x3-3/4" pans.  And my oven was broken so I used my
  toaster oven and baked one pan 35 minutes at 350.  The batter is so
  thick it's very hard to work with; I need to add more liquid next
  time. It's also too rich to bake easily, think I'll replace some sour
  cream with water or milk.

      1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 pn Salt
    1/4 ts Baking powder
      4 tb Butter
      1 lg Egg

MMMMM---------------------BLUEBERRY FILLING--------------------------
      2 pt Blueberries
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Cornstarch
      3 tb Water
      1 tb Grated lemon zest
    3/4 c  Walnut pieces
           - toasted & coarsely chopped

MMMMM--------------------WALNUT CRUMB TOPPING-------------------------
      4 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Walnuts, coarsely chopped
 
  MIXING THE PASTRY DOUGH: Stir together the dry ingredients in a bowl.
  Cut up and add the butter; toss gently to coat. Rub in the butter
  until the mixture looks sandy. Beat the egg and toss into the flour
  and butter mixture. Press the dough together, wrap and chill it.
  FORMING THE PIE SHELL: Lightly flour the work surface and dough. Roll
  the dough to a 14-inch diameter disk, 1/8-inch thick. Fit the dough
  into a 9-inch oven-proof glass pie pan and trim away all but 1/4-inch
  of the excess dough. Turn the excess dough under and flute the edge
  of the pie. Chill while preparing the filling. MIXING THE FILLING:
  Rinse and pick over the blueberries and drain them on a
  paper-towel-lined pan. Combine one third of the berries and the sugar
  in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring
  occasionally. Simmer the berries in the juices that accumulate about
  5 minutes. Strain the juices into another pan. Pour the water into a
  small bowl and stir in the cornstarch to dissolve it. Return the
  blueberry juices to a boil and beat about one quarter of it into the
  dissolved cornstarch. Return the remaining juices to a boil and beat
  the cornstarch mixture into it. Return the juices to a boil, beating
  constantly, and allow to boil about 1 to 2 minutes, beating
  constantly. Stir in the remaining blueberries, the cooked berries,
  lemon zest and walnuts, and cool. MIXING THE CRUMB TOPPING: Cream the
  butter until soft, add the sugar and cream until soft and light. Beat
  in the cinnamon. Mix in the flour, then the walnuts. The mixture
  should fall into large, soft crumbs. Pour the filling into the
  prepared pan and smooth. Scatter over the crumbs and bake at 350F
  until the filling is set, the crumbs have colored and the crust is
  baked through, about 40 minutes. Cool on a rack. Makes one 9-inch pie.

 Categories: Salads, Vegetables, Italian, Low-cal
      Yield: 4 Cups
 
      6 oz Can of V-8 juice
    1/4 c  Salad oil
      2 tb Vinegar
      6 oz Pkg Italian Dressing mix
      2 c  Cauliflowerets
      2 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
      1 c  Sliced carrots
      1 c  Sliced green pepper
      1 c  Sliced cucumber
 
  To make marinade:  In jar, combine V-8 juice, salad oil, vinegar, and
  salad dressing mix; shake well.  In bowl, combine vegetables; Pour
  marinade over all. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 4 hours,
  stirring occasionally.*
  
  NOTE:  If not going to be eaten the same day, perhaps wait to add
  mushrooms and cucumbers until a few hours before serving --- they
  will go limp instead of remaining crisp. The balance can be combined
  and marinated up to a couple of days ahead of serving in the
  refrigerator.
  
  * I have found it works best if you marinate in a tightly covered
  bowl. Then when you are in the kitchen and think about it, you can
  just turn it upside down, shake it a bit, and put it back in the frig
  instead of stirring it.

  or sharp knife. Cut into very thin slices. Combine rinds with water
  and soda in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer, covered for
  20 minutes. Stir occasionally.  Chop peeled fruit, discard seeds. Add
  to cooked rind and continue simmering for 10 minutes.  Measure 3 cups
  (750 ml) fruit mixture in a large saucepan. TO MAKE MARMALADE: To the
  3 cups (750 ml) fruit add the sugar. Stir well. Heat on high and
  bring to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly.  Boil for 1
  minute. Remove from heat and stir in liquid pectin.  Skim off foam.
  Stir and skim for a full 7 minutes. Ladle into hot sterilized jars
  and seal.
  
  Makes 5 - 1 cup (250 ml) jars.

      Title: BO BAY MON
 Categories: Vietnam, Update
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------THE DIPPING SAUCE--------------------------
      1 tb Shrimp paste
           Juice of 2 lemons
  1 1/2 tb Sugar, granulated
      1 ts Chili paste
      1 ts Ginger; chopped fine
      1 ts Pineapple; finely chopped
 
  Put shrimp paste in a bowl, add lemons juice, sugar, chili paste, and
  chopped ginger. Stir the sauce thoroughly to mix all the ingredients.
  In the Mekong Delta they add finely chopped fresh pineapple. You have
  enough dipping sauce for 4 persons. Taste it. If you find the sauce
  too salty, fine tune with lemon juice and sugar. Remember, this is
  usually a 4 to 6 hours meal. In a summer evening, in your back yard
  with your good friends, it is very appropriate. THE VEGETABLES Use
  several large plates to dispose the vegetables. They are used with
  wet rice paper to make rolls with the meat and then dipped in the
  sauce. The vegetables list: - salad: use the soft variety, Boston is
  the best. - cucumber: slice it half-moon - bean sprouts - green
  banana (optional): slice it sausage style ~ herbs: cilantro, basil,
  mint. THE MEAT You need the following beef cuts: ~ beef fondue, very
  thin slices - ground beef. You have to put it through the food
  processor to get a mellow paste. Because it is a very long and
  substantial meal I suggest you to plan a little more than 1/4 pound
  of meat for every guest. On the subsequent try you can serve only the
  beef cooked the way you like. HOW TO SERVE BO BAY MON Like any fondue
  Bo Bay Mon is not a time consuming recipe because it is a cook-it
  yourself meal. There is not a special sequence to serve the different
  courses. Do it as you like, the South Vietnamese are easy going
  people. Here is the usual sequence. 1st course. In a small pot put on
  a heater make a mix of 1 cup of coconut vinegar (or wine vinegar) 2
  cups of water and 1 tea spoon of sugar. Let it simmer on the table.
  To eat the 1st course take a slice of beef fondue, dip it in the hot
  liquid for a few second. Take a piece of wet rice paper, a little bit
  of evry vegetables on the table, add the cooked beef, roll and then
  dip it in the sauce. This procudure will be repeated for the six
  following courses, the 7th is a bowl of soup (if you can go so far).
  2nd course Use the ground beef. Add a little smash garlic, honey and
  ginger. Roll the mixture around a small skewer like a pogo stick.
  Grill them over a small charcoal fire or a small stove st on the
  table. Two sticks per gust is enough. 3nd course Use the same mixture
  as in the 2nd course but roll it in vine leaf. Grill the rolls. Two
  rolls per guest. 4nd course Use the beef slices previously marinated
  in garlic, lemon juice and black pepper. Two slices per guest. 5th
  course Use the beef slices previously marinated in light soy sauce,
  rice wine, garlic and black pepper. Stir fry the slices quickly in
  peanut oil. 6th course A good small piece of steak previously
  marinated in salt, black pepper and garlic. 1 piece per guest. 7th
  course Prepare a small pot of rice soup. Add a little fish sauce, a
  pinch of ginger, black pepper and scallion. One small rice bowl per
  guest. THE WINE With Bo Bay Mon which is quite salty because of the
  dipping sauce, I think cool beer is the best drink to go with the
  meal but unless you and your guest have a high degree of self-control
  you will become bloated very quickly. A not so dry white wine is a
  good choice. A good bottle of cool rosé is also welcome. Dessert is
  out of question unless you have a good supply of Alka Seltzer,
  Mylanta etc.. Enjoy!Subj: Bo Bay Mon

      Title: BO'S CHOCOLATE CHIP CHEESECAKE
 Categories: Cheesecakes
      Yield: 1 Cheesecake
 
     24 oz Cream cheese,
           -broken into pieces
      4    Eggs, separated
      2 tb Vanilla extract
           -(do not use artificial
           -vanilla)
      1 c  Sour cream
    1/4 c  Brown sugar,
           -or to taste
      1 lb Chocolate chips
      1 lb Graham cracker crumbs
    1/2 c  Butter, melted
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
  
  PREPARE THE BATTER:  Place the egg yolks in a food processor for 5
  seconds, then add the cream cheese and beat until smooth. Add the
  brown sugar and vanilla and process for several minutes, or until the
  batter is very smooth. Beat the egg whites and fold into the cheese
  mixture. Set aside.
  
  PREPARE THE CRUST:  Soften butter and combine with graham cracker
  crumbs. Mix until fully blended, e.g. they will form a ball when
  squeezed in your hand or by a spoon. Pat the crust into the sides and
  bottom of a springform pan about 9 inches in diameter.
  
  Spread a generous layer of chips on the bottom of the pan, and then
  pour the batter into the pan. Add another generous layer of chips to
  the top of the cake.
  
  Place the filled pan into the preheated oven.  Baking time will vary
  from about 30 minutes to 2 hours. Cooking time depends on whether you
  want a soft, gooey "New York" style cheesecake (shorter) to a fluffy
  "souffle"-like cheesecake (longer). The longer you cook it, the
  fluffier it gets.
  
  When the cake starts to rise like a souffle, start checking to see if
  it is done.  It will just about double in volume, and should not flow
  over the sides of the pan. If the cake shimmers like Jello when
  shaken, it is done. Alternatively, if a knife inserted comes out
  clean, the cake is overcooked: the knife should be very lightly
  coated with batter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A truly decadent chocolate chip cheesecake -- This recipe came to
  me from a friend of mine, Bo (pronounced "boo") Ture Ahlberg, who
  would occasionally (read "whenever we could persuade him") bring it
  into work. Needless to say, it would be snarfed up immediately.
  
  *  Bo prefers to use Nestle Mini-Morsel chocolate chips.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, up to 2 hours cooking.

      Title: BOB'S BUFFET BISCUITS
 Categories: Biscuits
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
     40 oz Biscuit mix
           -(e.g. 1 box of Bisquick)
    3/4 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
    1/3 c  Green onions, chopped
      2    Eggs, slightly beaten
      2 c  Milk
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a big bowl mix the biscuit mix,
  onions, eggs, milk and about 1/2 cup of the cheese.
  
  Put the dough into a  9x13 inch baking pan and smooth it down. You
  will have to flour your hand or spatula to do this. Sprinkle the rest
  of the cheese over the top and then use the spatula or knife to score
  the dough into square biscuits. Cut all the way to the pan.
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 40 to 45 minutes. When
  they are done a wooden toothpick stuck into the dough will come out
  clean.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Some not-so-plain biscuits -- This recipe is from Bob Clover of
  Sausalito, California and was first published in _Sunset_ magazine.
  Yield: 24-30 biscuits.
  
  *  When you take them out of the oven, flip the pan upside down over
  a rack to get the biscuits out, then flip the rack over to get
  everything back right side up again.
  
  *  This is good if you are having a lot of company or want a lot of
  leftovers.

      3    Stalks celery, sliced

      8 oz Butter (two sticks)
      8 oz Flour (one cup)
    1/2 ts Dried Thyme leaves
      1    Bottle Doxee's Clam Juice
      2 c  Uncooked parboilled rice
           - use Uncle Ben's converted
    1/2 ts Dried Oregano leaves
      2    Bay leaves
           Salt and pepper to taste
           A little MSG
      4 c  Chicken stock (about)
           Fry pan or deep pot, IRON
 
  This is an authentic family recipe that my mother taught me in 1950
  in New Orleans.  It makes a great dinner party main dish. Like
  chinese food, it is long on chopping and assembling, but goes
  together and cooks rather quickly.
  
  Shrimp - First peel shrimp, keep chilled, save shells. Put shells in
  small pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer
  for 15 minutes.  When water has been reduced by about half, remove
  from heat, cool, and strain out shells.  Reserve water.
  
  Chicken and sausage - Chop sausage and chicken into medium bite-sized
  pieces, brown in fry pan, drain, set aside.
  
  Okra - Cut off stems and tips, slice into 1/2" pieces. Set aside.
  
  Prepare garlic, Spanish onions, green onions, celery, set aside
  separately.
  
  Roux - Melt butter in a large IRON pan or deep pot, add flour. Stir
  constantly over low heat until flour is cooked, starting to lightly
  brown. Care is needed here because from cooked to burned is a short
  but tragic step, but you can start over.  After light brown, the
  color is all politics, it tastes good.
  
  Once the roux is cooked, stir in garlic and celery. Turn up heat a
  bit, say about medium, but stir constantially to prevent roux from
  burning. After about 1-2 minutes, dump in chopped Spanish onions and
  green pepper, continue stirring.  After another minute or so of
  cooking and stiring, dump in the okra.  By this time the roux appears
  to have disappeared, but is still there, clinging to the vegetables.
  Continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes till the okra starts to wilt
  and become shiny. (If you are using an iron fry pan, rather than a
  pot, you will now be running out of space and will need to now
  transfer the ingredients to a larger pot to continue.)
  
  Stir in the chicken and sausage pieces.  After another minute, mix in
  shrimp water, the oyster juice, the bottle of Doxee's Clam Juice
  (THIS IS THE SECRET TO THE NOLA FLAVOR!), and enough chicken stock to
  cover the ingredients by an inch or so.  Add bay leaves, Tabasco and
  Worcestershire sauces, spices, salt and pepper. Slowly bring to a
  boil (over a period of five minutes or more), stirring frequently. As
  soon as the mixture boils, immediately remove from heat and cover.
  
  After five minutes, remove cover, add tomato, oysters, scallops and
  shrimp. Give a few more stirs, re-cover, and wait for 20 minutes. The
  declining heat from the mixture will cook, but not overcook, the
  seafood. From this point, this mixture should never be brought to the
  boil again. Now is a good time to make the rice.
  
  Check for thickness.  If too thick, thin out with additional chicken
  stock. If too thin, add file' in a separate serving bowl before
  adding to rice. Once file' is added to gumbo, do not re-heat, as this
  will cause stringiness.  Just before serving, mix in the chopped
  green onions. They should be only slightly cooked, a little wilted
  but also a little crunchy.
  
  Serve in soup platter, with an island of white rice surrounded by a
  green moat of gumbo, meat and seafood. Serve with split buttered and
  broiled French bread, and white wine or beer.
  
  This is an expensive dish to fix, and there should be no left-overs.
  If there are, then use up promptly, because of the seafood content. *

      Title: BOBALKY
 Categories: Ethnic, Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Butter
      1 pk Yeast
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Water, lukewarm
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      7 c  Flour, all purpose, sifted
      2 c  Milk, scalded
 
  Into a mixing bowl, place butter, sugar, and salt. Add scalded milk;
  let cool until lukewarm. Add yeast dissolved in water. Add enough
  flour to make a soft elastic dough. Turn onto a floured board and
  knead. Place in a greased bowl and let rise until double in bulk (1
  to 1 1/2 hours) in a warm place, free from drafts. Punch dough down
  with fingertips and let rise again (about 45 minutes). Toss lightly
  on floured board, knead, and shape into a roll (like a pipe) about
  1/2 inch in diameter. Place on cookie sheet. Cut with edge of
  teaspoon into small pieces and let rise for 10 minutes. Bake at 375-F
  for 15 minutes or until lightly brown. When cool, break and place in
  collander. Pour boiling water over bobalky. Place on serving dish,
  mix with poppy seed and melted butter, and serve.
       Poppy seed (1/2 cup) should be ground and cooked in 3/4 cup
  water for 10 minutes. Boil 3 cups milk and 1 cup sugar and mix with
  poppy seed.
       Instead of using sugar in poppy seed mixture, honey may be used,
  poured over the bobalky.
       If your family is small, divide the above dough into two
  portions, bake bobalky from one portion, and a loaf of bread from the
  other.

  beets for 45 To 1 hour or until the beets are tender. Drain and rinse
  the beets under cold water until they are cool. Peel and grate the
  beets.
  
  When the meat is tender, Remove the bones and strip off the meat in
  bite size pieces. Return the meat to the broth and stir in the grated
  beets. Season the soup with salt and pepper. In a large bowl stir
  together the sour cream, milk and flour. Add two cups of the hot
  stock to the sour cream mixture and stir to combine. Pour this
  mixture through a strainer into the soup. Heat the soup over medium
  heat at a gentle simmer, but do not allow it to boil. Boiling will
  cause the sour cream to curdle. Serve immediately with boiled
  potatoes and pumpernickel or rye bread.

  2 1/2 c  BREAD flour
    1/2 ts -Salt
    3/4 ts Active dry yeast
      1 c  -Warm water
      2 sm Cloves garlic; thinly sliced
      2 tb Rosemary*
      3 tb Bertolli Light olive oil
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine flour, salt, yeast and water in
  bowl. Blend well, turn out onto floured surface. Knead well, about 15
  minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl, not buttered, cover with a
  damp cloth and let rise for 1-1/2 hours (until doubled in bulk). Turn
  dough out, punch down and knead for 5 minutes or so. Return to bowl
  and let rise until doubled in bulk.  Punch down and turn out on
  lightly floured board. Roll and press out to about 1/2 inch
  thickness. This recipe makes about 1-12 inchers-so you can judge
  whether to double or reduce the recipe. Rub surface of baking
  (cookie) sheet with oil and transfer the dough round to the sheet.
  Make several indentations with the point of a knife in the dough and
  insert garlic slices and rosemary into indentations.Rub olive oil
  (pour) onto surface and gently smooth over the surface. Salt and
  pepper surface LIGHTLY.  Bake 10-12 minutes or until just golden.
  Remove from oven and TAKE OUT THE GARLIC SLIVERS! You can now top the
  crust, freeze it, eat it the way it is, smille at it (YOU DID IT!)
  Remember, when you top it the crust is alread 2/3 baked and will
  require only enough time so that the cheeses, etc. are bubbly.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 sl White bread
           Milk
      2    Onions, thinly sliced
      1    Apple, peeled and diced
      2 tb Butter
      1 lb Ground lamb
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Cider vinegar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 c  Raisins
      2    Eggs
     12    Blanched almonds, coarsely
           -chopped
      6    Kaffir lime leaves
      1 c  Milk
      1 ts Turmeric
           Cooked white rice (opt)
           Chutney (opt)
 
  This curry-flavored meatloaf recipe made the rounds years ago, when
  kaffir lime leaves were unknown here. Most people used bay leaves
  instead, or even lemon oro range leaves from a backyard tree.
  However, it takes the kaffir leaves to add the proper touch of
  delicate, lemony perfume.
  
  Soak bread in bowl with milk to cover until soft, then squeeze dry.
  Saute onions and apple in skillet with butter until tender and not
  browned. Add bread, lamb, curry powder, sugar, vinegar, salt, pepper
  and raisins. Add one beaten egg and almonds and mix thoroughly.
  
  Pack mixture lightly into 9x5" baking dish. Arrange lime leaves on
  top. Bake at 350'F. 1 hour. Beat remaining egg with milk. Stir in
  turmeric. Pour over meatloaf and bake 15 minutes longer. Serve with
  rice and chutney.

      Title: BOCKWURST
 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      5 lb Veal
    1/4 c  Chives
      1 tb Salt
      2 ts Sage
      2 ts White pepper
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Mace, ground
      1 ts Cloves, ground
      3 dr Lemon extract
      3    Eggs
      1 c  Cream, heavy
           Small hog casings
 
  Use veal shoulder or trimmings. Work veal twice through fine blade of
  grinder and add to large bowl. Sprinkle chives, salt, sage, pepper,
  sugar, mace, cloves and lemon extract over meat.  Add eggs and cream
  and beat 5 minutes, until mixture comes away from sides of bowl. Fill
  casings with mixture and tie or twist into 5-6" lengths. Bring kettle
  of heavily salted water to boil.  Lower in sausages, preferably in
  wire basket, and simmer very gently 2-3 minutes. Let cool in water,
  then drain. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 days. To serve: simmer
  in water for 10-15 minutes, drain and serve with bread and butter
  with sweet mustard as a seasoning. Several types of sausages are easy
  to make at home. Casings can be found in specialty meat markets and
  are traditionally made of animal intestines. Saltpeter (remember that
  from your military mess days?) is used as a preservative in some
  sausages and is available in drugstores. Fresh sausages do not keep
  well and should be used in a few days. The more spice, salt and
  saltpeter they contain means a longer storage time for the sausage.

  Recipe by: The New York Times Cookbook 1. Roll the beef cubes in
  flour and brown them on all sides in a skillet over high heat in four
  tablespoons each of the butter and olive oil.
  
  2.  Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper, pour the cognac over it
  and ignite.  When the flame dies, transfer the meat to a three-quart
  casserole.
  
  3.  Preheat oven to moderate (350F)
  
  4.  To the skillet add the bacon, garlic, carrots, leeks, chopped
  onions and two tablespoons chopped parsley. Cook, stirring, until the
  bacon is crisp and the vegetables are lightly browned. Transfer to
  the casserole with the meat and add the bay leaf, thyme, Burgundy and
  enough water to barely cover the meat. Cover and bake 1 1/2 hours.
  
  5.  Prepare a beurre manie by blending one tablespoon each butter and
  flour and stir into the casserole bit by bit. Return the casserole to
  the oven and continue cooking 2 - 3 hours longer.
  
  6.  Brown the small onions in 2 tablespoons butter with a dash of
  sugar. Add a little water, cover and cook until the onions are almost
  tender.
  
  7.  Saute the mushrooms in two tablespoons each of the butter and oil
  until lightly browned on one side. Sprinkle with lemon juice and turn
  to brown the other side.
  
  8.  To serve, add the onions to the casserole and garnish with the
  mushrooms and parsley.

  The tremendous success of this Beef Burgundy depends primaily on three
  things: The cut of meat used; The long, slow baking time; The quality
  of wine used. The meat needs to be extremely lean and durable enough
  to last through several hours of baking. Round or rump is perfect for
  the purpose. The long baking time at low temperature brings out the
  wonderful richness of the dish. Finally, the choice of wine. To put
  it bluntly, a cheap, bad, or wrongly chosen wine will ruin the dish.
  Bordeaux wines, though they have the right quality, are too delicate
  to add the richness the dish needs. White wines (other than a white
  burgundy) are too thin. The best wine is a full, rich French
  burgundy, or its California counterpart. Chateauneuf-du-Pape is a
  great choice. So is a white burgundy, if the desired result is a less
  intense wine flavor. In any event, there are many good French and
  California burgundies that would work very well, without costing an
  arm and a leg. Just don't use a two dollar bottle of wine, unless you
  want a two dollar beef burgundy.
  
  Heat 4T olive oil and 1/2 c butter in a large skillet. Dredge the
  meat in flour to coat, and brown in the skillet. Flame with the
  warmed cognac. When the flames have gone out, place the meat in an
  oven proof pot. Use a slotted spoon.
        Saute the diced salt pork until very crisp. Put in the pot with
  the meat.
        Mince the large onion and the garlic. Slice the carrots, leeks,
  and shallots. Add all to the skillet and saute until tender and
  browned. Place in the baking pot with the meats. Add salt and fresh
  ground pepper. Finally, add enough burgundy to completely immerse the
  ingredients, making sure to reserve enough wine to later on cook the
  boiling onions (about 4T for six servings). Cover pot and bake in
  oven 1 1/2 - 2 hours at 260 to 300 degrees.
        At the end of the baking time, skim off any fat; Then, add
  about 2T butter and 2T flour. Add the flour slowly to prevent
  lumping. Continue baking for about 2 hours longer.
        One hour before the dish is done:
        Saute until almost tender the boiling onions, in about 1T
  butter, with a few pinches of sugar and the remaining 4T or so of the
  wine. Reserve and keep warm.
        Saute til lightly browned the mushroom caps in the remaining 1T
  butter, 1T olive oil, and a little lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon for 6
  servings). Reserve and keep warm.
        Final assembly: About 1/2 hour before the beef burgundy is done,
  gently stir in the boiling onions and the mushroom caps, along with
  their collected juices. When the dish is done, garnish with the
  minced parsley.
        Wonderful with garlic bread and more of the burgundy used in the
  recipe.

      2 ts Butter, melted-NO MORE
           Bread Crumbs
 
  Chicken & Gravy Place chicken with onion, paprika, marjoram and
  pepper in a large stick pot, with enough water to cover (at least 8
  cups). Bring to boil. Reduce heat and SIMMER until tender, about 40
  min or until no red juices come out when pierced with a fork. Remove
  chicken and cover to keep warm.  Save the stock.
  
   Prepare dumplings as below.  Roll the dough into one inch diameter
  dumplings and drop into gently boiling stock. Boil over medium heat
  for 25 minutes, turning over after 12 minutes. Remove dumpling and
  keep warm with the chicken.  Save stock.
  
   Make a roux by melting the butter in a small skillet. Add the flour
  to the skillet and cook, stirring constantly until the mixture is the
  color of a new penny.
  
   Add enough of this roux mixture to the boiling stock to make a medium
  thick gravy. If lumps form, whisk them out with a wire whisk. Add a
  few drops of bead molasses if you wish for color and adjust spices
  with paprika, marjoram, pepper and salt to taste.  (I like more
  pepper in mine.) Simmer 5 minutes.
  
   Return meat and dumplings to gravy and reheat all to just a simmer.
  Remove from heat. Let stand in hot gravy for 10 before serving.
  
  DUMPLINGS Soak bread in milk. Squeeze out surplus milk. Shred bread
  into bowl. Add eggs, marjoram. salt and melted butter. Mix well. Add
  enough bread crumbs to make mixture into 1 inch balls that will NOT
  become fuzzy when boiled.  Test one by dropping into boiling stock,
  then adjust crumbs as needed. Cook as above.

 Categories: Irish, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Collar of bacon
           Medium-sized cabbage
 
  (NB: in Ireland, "bacon" can mean *any* cut of pork except ham. When
  people here want what North Americans call bacon, they ask for
  "rashers" or "streaky rashers". As far as I can tell, "collar of
  bacon" is a cut from the hock, picnic shoulder, or shoulder butt (I
  am here using terms from the diagram in THE JOY OF COOKING). You want
  any thick cut of pork, with or without bones, about four inches by
  four inches by four or five inches. It does not have to have been
  salted first, but if you want to approximate the taste of the real
  Irish thing, put it down in brine for a day or two, then (when ready
  to cook it) bring to a boil first, boil about 10 minutes, change the
  water, and start the recipe from the following point. .
  
  Place the joint in a pot, cover with cold water and bring to the boil,
  Remove the scum that floats to the surface. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2
  hours (or 30 minutes per pound). Cut cabbage into quarters and add to
  pot. Cook gently for about 1/2 hour, or until cabbage is cooked to
  your liking. (Test constantly: don't overdo it!) Drain, and serve
  with potatoes boiled in their jackets, and a sharp sauce -- mustard
  or (if you can get it) HP sauce.

      You will need a large kettle.  Cover corned beef with cold water;
  bring to simmering; cook at this temperature for 3 1/2 to 4 hours or
  until the meat is tender. At the end of 3 1/2 hours, add pared
  potatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnips and peeled whole onions to meat
  in the kettle. Lay cabbage wedges over top of vegetables and meat.
  Cover; cook for about 25 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
  Cook beets separately, if fresh, until tender.  Depending on size of
  beets, beets take longer to cook than some vegetables. If canned,
  reheat to boiling. When all is cooked, remove meat and vegetables to
  a large platter; keep warm while the dumplings cook in the  kettle
  juices. FOR THE DUMPLINGS:
     This needs to be a stiff moist batter.  Mix together and sift the
  flour, salt, baking powder and pepper. Combine egg and milk with
  melted butter; add to sifted dry ingredients. Have "pot likker"
  (liquid in which dinner was cooked) boiling.  Spoon batter by

      8 oz Cabbage, chopped fine
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Water
      2 oz Garlic chives or
           Scallions, green part,
           Minced
      8 oz Pork loin, not too lean,
           Chopped fine or
           -ground coarse
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts MSG
      3 tb Sesame oil
    1/4 ts Pepper, ground fine
      1 tb Ginger root, minced
           Dumplings:
      3 c  Flour
    3/4 c  Water, ice-cold
           Flour to prevent sticking
 
  Sprinkle cabbage with salt. Let stand 15 min. Drain. Add 1 c water and
  squeeze dry, discarding liquid. Add chives and pork. Mix all together
  with seasoning ingredients.
  
  Knead flour and water together until it is a smooth dough. Let rest
  10 min. Roll out into a long cylinder and divide into 48 or 50
  pieces. Roll out each piece into a 2" circle.
  
  Put 1/3 oz filling (appx) in each circle. Fold circles over and seal
  with water, pleating one side artistically as you go (optional!). If
  you pleat, you will get one crinkled side and one straight side, and
  the dumplings will pull into a slightly curved or crescent shape;
  otherwise you will have straight, flat, boring-looking dumplings that
  still taste fine.
  
  Cooking procedure 1:
  
  Boil 12 c water. Lower heat to low. Cook dumplings for 4 min, covered,
  stirring occasionally. This produces a standard restaurant dumpling.
  
  Cooking procedure 2:
  
  Boil 10 c water. Add 1/3 the dumplings and stir. Cover and let water
  return to a boil. Add 1/2 c icy cold water. Stir. Cover again and let
  water return to a boil. Add another 1/2 c icy cold water. Stir. Cover
  a third time and let water return to a boil. Remove dumplings
  immediately and drain them. Repeat the entire procedure until
  dumplings are done. This is said to produce a more delicate dumpling,
  but I don't recall ever having tried it myself.
  
  Sauce 1:
  
  1   c soy sauce 1/2 c broth (cooking water will do!) 1 t white
  vinegar or cider vinegar 1/2 t sesame oil 1/4 t sugar 1 t scallion,

 Categories: Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Peanuts,raw
           Water
 
  1. Wash raw peanuts thoroughly in cool water; then soak in clean cool
  water for about 30 minutes before cooking. 2. Put peanuts in a
  saucepan and cover completely with water. Because the shells of some
  peanuts absorb more salt than others, it's best to begin with 1
  tablespoon of salt for each 2 cups of peanuts; you can add more salt
  to taste later. 3. The cooking period for boiled peanuts varies
  according to the maturity of the peanuts used and the variety of
  peanut. The cooking time for a "freshly pulled" green peanut is
  shorter than for a peanut which has been stored for a time. 4. When
  fully cooked, the texture of the peanut should be similar to that of
  a cooked dry pea or bean. Boil the peanuts for about 35 minutes, then
  taste. If they are not salted enough, add more salt. Taste again in
  10 minutes, both for salt content and to see if the peanuts are fully
  cooked. If not ready, continue tasting every 5 minutes until they
  have a satisfactory texture. 5. Drain peanuts after cooking or they
  will continue to absorb salt and become oversalted. 6. Boiled peanuts
  are usually served as a snack, but they make a great substitute for
  dried cooked beans at any meal. They may be eaten hot, at room
  temperature, or chilled in the refrigerator and eaten cold, shelling
  as you eat them. They will keep in the refrigerator for several days,
  or they may be frozen.

      1 lb Flour
      1 pt Milk
 
  Cut suet in little pieces.  Beat the eggs, then half the milk, beat
  them together, and by degrees stir in the flour and bread together,
  then the suet, spice and fruit, and as much milk as will mix it all
  well together and very thick.
  
  Wet a large muslin cloth (3 foot square) and rub with flour inside
  and out. Drape it into a bowl large enough to hold the pudding mix.
  Pour the mixture in and tie up the muslin ends tightly, leaving the
  pudding in a large ball with some room for expansion. When tying the
  neck, leave long enough ends on the cords so you can knot a loop.
  Suspend the pudding in a large kettle or stock pot of boiling water,
  hanging the loop from a long wooden spoon straddling the open top of
  the pot, and boil five hours. Check water level frequently.  It
  evaporates quickly.
  
  When done, wrap in a clean muslin cloth and douse with 1/4 cup rum or
  brandy.  Check weekly and add additional rum or brandy if it appears
  dry.

  2 1/4 ts Soy sauce
  2 1/4 ts Sesame oil

MMMMM--------------------------WRAPPERS-------------------------------
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Water

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
           Soy sauce
           Vinegar
           Mushroom soaking liquid
           -OR- water
           Sesame oil (optional)
           Chile oil (optional)
 
  Mash the tofu to yield about 3/4 cup. To make the filling, combine
  mashed tofu with the minced ingredients, salt, soy sauce, and sesame
  oil. To make the wrappers, mix flour and water by hand, kneading just
  enough to make a ball of dough. Cover and let rest for at least an
  hour. Place on a lightly floured board, and knead for 2 minutes or
  so. With palms of your hands, roll it into a long, cylindrical shape,
  12 inches inches long, 1 inch in diameter.  Cut crosswise into
  1/2-inch pieces; you will have 24. If your climate is dry, keep the
  dough covered. Shape these, cut-side up, into a round shape. Flatten
  them with the palm or heel of your hand on a flour-dusted board.
  With a pastry roller, small rolling pin, piece of dowel, or even an
  empty jar -- all of these should be wielded under the palm of your
  hand -- roll each into a round wrapper, 3 inches in diameter, thicker
  in the center, thinner toward the edge. This is easily done by
  rolling the pastry roller from the edge of the piece of dough to the
  center, and back again, turning the dough counterclockwise a little
  with your left hand after each roll. Continue all the way around
  several times, also turning the dough over once or twice, until you
  have a thin, 3-inch wrapper. To assemble, place 1-1/2 teaspoons
  filling (or as much as the wrapper will hold) in an elongated mound
  in the center of each wrapper; fold the dough over the filling so
  that the edges meet. Press the edges together for a tight seal, at
  the same time making four or five tiny pleats, pinched tightly flush
  with the edge. Be sure that it is completely sealed to keep the water
  out and the filling in. (With commecial wrappers, it may be necessary
  to moisten half of the inside edge first to get a seal.) Bring 4 cups
  water to the boil in a pot. Immerse eight dumplings at a time for 3
  minutes (add an extra minute if frozen -- do not defrost them first).
  Lest they break open, add a little water to slow the boil whenever it
  becomes too rapid.  Stir occasionally in case some of them stick to
  the bottom (true to their name). After 3 minutes, remove the
  dumplings with a slotted spoon.  Cook the remaining two batches in
  the same way. Serve hot, accompanied by small dipping saucers of soy
  sauce and vinegar (cider or Chinese dark), mixed in roughly equal
  proportions, or to taste, and thinned with water or mushroom liquid
  if too strong; add perhaps a drop of sesame and/or chile oil. Some
  people like to add a little crushed garlic, minced green onion,
  and/or gingerroot. Advance preparation: These can be assembled ahead
  and frozen. Do not defrost before cooking.

      Title: BOILED RICE
 Categories: Oriental
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Long-grain white rice
           - (uncooked)
      2 c  Chicken broth or water
    1/2 ts Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  PUT RICE AND WATER or broth in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan, and bring to
  a boil. Stir once or twice. Lower heat to a simmer. Cover with a
  tight-fitting lid or heavy-duty foil and cook 15 minutes. If the rice
  is not quite tender or the liquid is not absorbed, replace lid and
  cook 2 to 4 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper. Fluff with a
  fork. To reheat, place in a colander over boiling water, making sure
  the water does not boil into or soak the rice, but only steams it.
  The rice will stay fluffy as long as the water doesn't evaporate. In
  restaurants it is kept this way for hours. Cover the rice to prevent
  the top layer from drying out. TIPS: For drier rice, use 2
  tablespoons less water.

      Title: BOILED RICE & VEGGIE PATTIES
 Categories: Vegetables, Low-cal, Meat sub
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Carrot shredded
    3/4 c  Rice brown cooked
    1/2 c  Mozzarella part skim
    1/3 c  Onion chopped
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
    1/3 c  Dry roasted peanuts
      1 tb Parsley fresh
    1/4 ts Ginger, ground
      1 ts Coriander, ground
      2 lg Egg white
      1 tb Soy Sauce low sodium
    1/8 ts Pepper
 
  Carrots must be finely shredded and onion finely chopped. I use a food
  processor. Shred the mozzarella and crumble bread crumbs well. Chop
  the peanuts. In a large mixing bowl stir together the carrots, cooled
  cooked rice, cheese, onions, peanuts, bread crumbs, parsley, ginger,
  coriander and pepper. In a small bowl slightly beat the egg whites
  then blend in the soy sauce. Add to the rice mixture and blend well.
  Cover and chill in refrigerator for an hour or until firm enough to
  handle. Shape the mixture into four 3/4 inch thick patties. Spray a
  baking sheet with oil. Place patties on sheet. Broil four inches from
  the heat for seven minutes. Turn and broil two minutes more until
  set. Serve as you would a hamburger. I have done this in a skillet
  but you must be careful handling the patties or they break up.  Be
  sure to let the first side get well done before trying to turn them.
  Helps to have frozen the patties for easy of handling before cooking.

  almost soft.
    Make a roux with butter and flour, cook for only a few minutes,

  the roux.
    Pour roux into the vegetable mixture and bring again to a boil.

  almost always little bits of fish meat, bones and heads left over and
  that's when this soup would be a good beginning for a Lenten meal.

 Categories: Chinese, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 lb Boneless pork shoulder
      1 lb Bok choy stalks
    1/2 ts Minced garlic
    1/2 ts Minced fresh ginger
      3 tb Peanut oil
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Dry sherry
           Cornstarch paste
      1 ts MSG (opt)
 
  Slice pork against the grain into thin strips about 2" by 1/2".
  Seperate outer fleshy stalks from center flower stalk of bok choy.
  Use center stalk in another stir-fry dish or in soup. Wash outer
  stalks, and diagonally slice into 3" pieces.  The meatier ends of the
  stalks should be sliced a little thinner.
  
  Swirl oil around in very hot wok.  When oil begins to smoke, add pork
  and stir-fry until meat is seared (about 1 minute). Add bok choy,
  garlic and ginger. Stir-fry until green leaves are bright and
  shrivelled, stirring and tossing constantly so stalks won't burn. Add
  salt, stock, sugar and dry sherry.
  
  When liquid begins to boil, cover wok and steam for 30 seconds or
  less on high heat, until stalks are tender but still crisp. Push
  ingredients up side of wok; dribble cornstarch paste into liquid and
  stir to make a light sauce.  Recombine and add MSG.  Serve
  immediately.

           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 pk Dry active yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water (110 to 115
           -degrees)
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Butter or margarine
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Eggs at room temperature,
           -slightly beaten
  4 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour,
           -divided
  1 1/2 c  Firmly packed brown sugar,
           -divided
    1/2 c  Currants
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans
      1 ts Grated lemon zest
      1 ts Grated orange zest
    1/4 c  Orange juice
 
  In a small bowl, stir yeast into warm water and set aside.
  
  Warm milk and pour over sugar, butter and salt in large bowl; cool to
  lukewarm.
  
  Blend in eggs and yeast mixture, then add 4 cups flour and stir to

  into dough, and knead until smooth and satiny, about 5 minutes. Place
  in greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in
  warm place until double, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down. Roll into 28-by-14-inch rectangle. Combine 1/2 cup of the
  brown sugar, currants, pecans, lemon and orange zest; sprinkle evenly
  over dough.
  
  Beginning with wide side, roll dough up tightly. Cut into 18 1 1/2
  inch pieces.
  
  In pan, combine remaining 1 cup brown sugar, and orange juice; cook
  over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture boils and
  sugar melts.
  
  Divide syrup into 2 well-buttered 8-inch square pans. Arrange 9
  pinwheels of rolled dough in each pan. Cover and let rise until
  doubled, about 45 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, until lightly
  browned. Invert onto heated platter and serve.

      Title: BOLILLOS (MEXICAN ROLLS)
 Categories: Mexican, Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SPONGE--------------------------------
      3 tb Sugar
  2 1/2 c  Warm water (108F to 110F)
      1 tb Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
    1/4 c  Gluten flour

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
           Starter sponge (above)
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Very soft butter
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
  3 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
    1/2 c  Gluten flour (see note)
    1/2 c  Warm water mixed with 2
           -teaspoons salt
 
  The starter sponge:
  
  Whisk together all ingredients until well blended. Cover with plastic
  wrap or a damp towel, set in a warm place and let rise, undisturbed,
  for 1 hour.
  
  The dough:
  
  Combine the sponge, salt, butter, cinnamon, 3 cups of the unbleached
  flour and the gluten flour.
  
  Using the flat paddle attachment of a heavy duty mixer, beat the
  dough for at least 4 minutes.
  
  Turn out dough onto a board and knead in the remaining 1/2 cup flour.
  (If you do not have a heavy duty mixer, knead the dough by hand for
  at least 10 minutes, incorporating the 1/2 cup flour.)
  
  The dough tends to be sticky, so have patience. However, the finished
  dough should be on the softer-stickier side rather than being
  perfectly smooth.
  
  During the beating and kneading process, the dough should develop
  long, stretchy++strands a sign that the gluten has been well
  developed. This is necessary to finished rolls.
  
  Place the dough in a greased bowl, turn to coat with grease, then
  cover with plastic wrap, set in a warm place and let rise for 1 hour,
  or until doubled in bulk.
  
  To shape:
  
  Punch down the dough.and turn out onto a floured board. Pinch off 12
  equal-size pieces of dough.
  
  With floured hands, roll each piece into an oblong, turning rough
  edges under with your fingers.
  
  To achieve the pointed tips, gently pull the ends of each oblong,
  giving a slight twist as you pull.  If the bolillos have sort of a
  rough surface, all the better. They will look authentic.
  
  Place the bolillos on heavy baking sheets that have been greased or
  lined with parchment.  Make a each roll.
  
  Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for 30 minutes, or until
  almost doubled.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Pour the salted water into a spray bottle.
  
  Bake bolillos for 10 minutes, misting with the salt water at least 3
  or 4 times.  This will produce a crusty exterior.
  
  Reduce oven temperature to 375F and bake for 20 minutes longer, or
  until rolls are golden brown.
  
  Makes 12 bolillos.
  
  Note: Gluten flour may be found in natural food stores.

 Categories: Try it, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  ~Brazil
      1/2 lb Parmesan cheese, ~freshly grated
      1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese, ~freshly grated
        3 lg Egg whites
        2 tb (heaping) flour Vegetable oil for frying
  
  Salgadinhos are small, usually savoury, fried appetizers that are a
  large part of Brazil's before dinner rituals. They are frequently
  balls of fish, cheese, or vegetables which are served with a variety
  of spicy sauces. These cheese balls would be prepared from the
  wonderful white cheese that comes from Minas Gerais in Brazil. Here a
  mixture of Parmesan and Mozzarella is substituted.
  
  Mix the cheeses together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Beat the
  egg whites into stiff peaks in another large bowl; and add them to
  the cheese, and fold in well. Form the mixture into balls and roll
  them in the flour. Meanwhile, heat 4 or 5 inches of oil in a large
  heavy saucepan to 350 to 375^F over medium-high heat.
  
  Drop in the cheese balls a few at a time and fry them until they are a
  golden brown. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper
  towels. Serve hot with cocktails.

      2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
      2 tb Minced fresh parsley
      1 c  Cracker meal or very fine
           -bread crumbs
           Peanut or vegetable oil for
           -frying
           Fresh lime juice to taste
      1 ea Drain the fish, place it in
           -a small saucepan, cover
           -with fresh water,
 
  and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and
  simmer 5 minutes. Drain and cool the fish, remove any skin and bones,
  and flake. 2. In a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat, cover
  the potatoes and garlic with salted water, bring to a boil, and cook
  until tender, 20 to 25 minutes, then drain. 3. Mash the potatoes,
  using a potato masher or fork, add the flaked fish, butter, salt,
  pepper, eggs, and parsley, and mix well. Refrigerate the mixture at
  least 30 minutes. 4. Sprinkle a light layer of cracker meal on a work
  surface. Taking a generous tablespoonful of the codfish mixture in
  the palm of your hand, form it into a ball about 1 l/2 inches in
  diameter, and roll it in the crumbs; repeat with all the codfish
  mixture, renewing the crumbs when necessary. 5. Preheat the oven to
  250 degrees. In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or deep fryer over
  medium-high heat, heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees, or until
  a drop of batter sizzles when it touches the oil, and fry the puffs
  until golden brown on all sides, turning with a slotted spoon. Do not
  fry too many at once or the oil temperature will fall and they will
  be soggy rather than crisp. Place the puffs on a paper- towel-lined
  platter in the oven until all have been cooked, and serve hot,
  sprinkled with lime juice. Makes 25 to 50 puffs Mary Urrutia

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Beef brisket
      3 ts Salt
      1 ea Celery stalk, with leaves
      1 ea Carrot
      1 ea Onion, small

  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~---------------- Beef brisket boiled with seasoning vegetables gives
  you the extra benefit of the broth to use as needed. This broth
  freezes very well.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~------------------ Chop all vegetables quite coarsely. Put beef and
  vegetables in a large pot ( a stock pot is ideal) with cold water to
  cover. Bring to a boil slowly over medium-low heat.  As the water
  boils, remove the froth that forms as much as possible. Lower heat to
  simmer, cover the pot, and cook for 3 hours.  The meat will be very
  tender and the broth a light brown. Remove meat from the pot and use
  in any recipe that calls for boiled beef. Strain broth and use
  immediately or freeze for future use.

      Title: BOLOGNESE MEAT SAUCE - RAGU ALLA BOLOGNESE
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 ea Medium onion, chopped fine
      1 ea Carrot, chopped fine
      1 ea Celery stalk, chopped fine
    1/4 lb Pancetta (see note below)
  1 1/2 lb Ground veal
      1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
      1 c  Dry white wine
      1 cn (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
    1/2 c  Milk

MMMMM---------------------------------------------------------------
 
  Pancetta is the same cut of pork as bacon.  It is cured with salt and
  is not smoked.  It comes rolled up like a large salami. Widely used
  in Italian cooking, especially in Emilia-Romagna, it is vital to many
  dishes. If available, buy a large quantity, cut into several pieces
  and freeze it. You can substitute domestic bacon for pancetta. It
  must be blanched in boiling water for two to three minutes to reduce
  the smoky flavour. Fresh side pork can can also be used. Melt butter
  with oil in a large saucepan. When the butter foams, add onion,
  carrot, celery and pancetta. Saute over medium heat until lightly
  browned. Add veal. Cook and stir until meat is no longer pink. Season
  with salt and pepper. Increase heat and stir in wine. Cook until wine
  has evaporated.  Press tomatoes (one 28 oz. can crushed Italian-style
  tomatoes) through food mill or sieve, to remove seeds and skin.  Stir
  tomato pulp into veal mixture. Cover and reduce heat. Simmer 1 to
  1-1/2 hours or until sauce reaches a medium-thick consistency. Stir
  occasionally during cooking. Add Milk and cook 5 minutes longer.
  Makes 2-1/2 to 3 cups of sauce.

  and pestle, adding water if needed to form a soft mass. (Tiny lumps
  are fine). Blend spices into the paste, and then stir all into the

      Title: BOMBE FAVORITE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    175 g  Crme fraiche
     15 g  Icing sugar; plus...
      2 tb Icing sugar; sifted
     75 g  Little macaroons
           -- broken in pieces
      1    Egg white
 
  A favourite indeed. Small pieces of macaroon are folded into a crme
  fraiche ice cream base and lightly frozen. A delicious dessert for
  summer.
  
  Whisk the crme fraiche with the sifted icing sugar. Fold in the
  macaroon pieces. Beat the egg white until very stiff, add 2 tbs of
  icing sugar and beat again. Fold into the crme fraiche mixture and
  put into a serving-dish. Freeze lightly - about 2 hours - before
  serving, so that it comes out like soft ice cream.

  2 1/4 ts Dry yeast (or 1 packed

           Yeast
    1/4 c  (liquid measure) warm water

      1 c  Cornmeal
      1 c  Rye flour
    1/2 c  Nonfat dry milk (lightly
           Spooned into the cup)
      4 ts Kelp powder
      4 c  Beef or chicken broth
           (liquid measure)

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1    Large egg
      2 tb Milk
 
  Equipment: Cookie sheets lined with parchment or aluminum foil;
  rolling pin; 3-31/2" bone cutter or 2 1/2" round cookie cutter.
  
  Place 2 oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat
  oven to 300F.
  
  Sprinkle the dry yeast or crumple the compressed yeast over the water
  (110F if dry yeast, 100F if compressed yeast). Add a pinch of sugar
  and allow the yeast to sit in a draft-free spot for 10-20 minutes.
  The mixture should be full of bubbles.  If not, the yeast is too old
  to be useful.
  
  In a large bowl, place all the dry ingredients and stir to blend
  them. Add the yeast mixture and 3 cups of the broth. Using your
  hands, in the bowl, mix to form the dough, adding more broth if
  needed to make the dough smooth and supple.  Half a batch at a time,
  knead the dough briefly on a lightly floured counter. (Keep the
  second batch of dough covered with a moist towel while shaping and
  cutting the first.)
  
  Roll out the dough into an 18 x 13 x 1/4" rectangle. Cut it into
  desired shapes, using a 3 - 3 1/2-inch bone cutter or a 2 1/2-inch
  round cookie cutter. Reroll the scraps. Repeat the procedure with the
  remaining dough.
  
  For an attractive shine, lightly beat together the egg and milk.
  Brush the glaze on the cookies.
  
  Bake for 45 to 60 minutes or until brown and firm. For even baking,
  rotate the cookie sheets from top to bottom three quarters of the way
  through the baking period.
  
  Use a small, angled metal spatula or pancake turner to transfer the
  cookies to wire racks to cool completely.
  
  Store in an airtight container at room temperature. The dough must be
  used immediately.  The baked cookies will keep for many months.
  
  Allow cookie sheets to cool completely between batches.

     12    Oysters, fresh or frozen
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Oil
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  Use only the large Asiatic oysters caught in the Indian Ocean, Black
  Sea, or the Persian and Arabian gulfs.
  
  Use the delicious white meat only.  Discard the round white bone
  sometimes discovered inside the shell -- or give it to some Persian.
  They seem to prefer these bones to gold; they call them "pearls".

  Drain oysters.  Roll in flour.  Heat oil until hot in a large frying
  pan. Fry oysters on medium-high heat for 5 minutes turning over once.

  ingredients that are almost always in the refrigerator. Even a plain

  Femme Sauce. Make it with chicken stock and serve it over poached
  eggs instead of Hollandaise, or pour it over steamed vegetables.
  
  Salt And Freshly Ground White Pepper, To Taste
  
  Beat the egg yolks in a large mixing bowl until light, then whisk in
  the scalded cream.  Next, pour the boiling stock into the egg mixture
  and beat in the butter. Season with salt and pepper and serve
  immediately.
  
  Yield:  About 2 1/2 cups of sauce.

      Title: BOOZEY RICH EGGNOG FROM A COOKED BASE
 Categories: Alcohol, Holiday
      Yield: 25 Servings
 
      1 qt Milk
      1    Vanilla bean OR 1 tb extract
     12    Egg yolks
      2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Dark rum
      2 c  Bourbon
      1 c  Cognac or other brandy
      8    Egg whites
      3 tb Sugar
      1 qt Cream
           Freshly grated nutmeg
 
  FOR BASE: In a heavy medium-sized saucepan, barely boil the milk with
  the vanilla bean, which has beens split lengthwise, scraped with the
  back edge of a knife and added to the milk--seeds, pod, and all (if
  using vanilla extract, you'll add it after eggnog base has cooked).
  
  Meanwhile, place a large fine-mesh strainer over a bowl set in a
  large bowl of ice.
  
  Beat the yolks and sugar together in the top of a double boiler, by
  hand or with electric beaters, until thick and smooth, about 1
  minute. Whisk in the hot vanilla milk. Cook in the double boiler set
  over simmering water, stirring constantly all around the bottom and
  corners with a rubber or wooden spatula. In time, foam will subside.
  The eggnog base is done when it coats a wooden spoon without bare
  spots, 12 to 15 minutes.
  
  Immediately pour through strainer, stirring to cool. When cool to the
  touch, slowly whisk in all liquors (if using vanilla extract instead
  of vanilla bean, add this now, too). Store eggnog base in refrigerator
  overnight or up to three days, to ripen.
  
  TO COMPLETE EGGNOG: At serving, remove vanilla bean and pour eggnog
  base into a large punch bowl.
  
  Beat egg whites with 3 tablespoons sugar to stiff peaks; fold into
  eggnog mixture. Beat cream to stiff peaks and fold it in, too. Let
  some lumps of the cream and egg whites float on surface. Sprinkle
  with nutmeg. Serve immediately, using a ladle.

      Title: BORDELAISE SAUCE FOR GAME
 Categories: Beef, Game, Sauces, Jw
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------MATIGNON-------------------------------
    1/3 c  Parsnip, diced
    1/3 c  Celery ribs&leaves, chopped
      1    Sprig of thyme
      1 ts Bacon fat or butter
    1/3 c  Onion, chopped
      2    Bay leaves, crushed
      1 tb Bacon, minced
    1/4 c  Madeira

MMMMM----------------------SAUCE ESPAGNOLE---------------------------
      1 c  Matignon, from above
    1/2 c  Flour
      2 c  Tomatoes, peeled, chopped
      8 c  Stock, clarified carb/beef
    1/2 c  Caribou or beef drippings
     12    Cracked peppercorns
    1/4 c  Parsley, chopped

MMMMM----------------------BORDELAISE SAUCE---------------------------
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
      1 c  Espagnole sauce, from above
      6    Crushed peppercorns
    1/4 c  Bone marrow, diced.
 
  This is a three step process ( four if you count making the stock in
  advance) but well worth it as it makes a superb accompliment to the
  finest game or beef steaks and roasts. The Matignon is similar to
  Mirepoix. Carrot is traditional in the classic French recipe but
  parsnip is more appropriate for game. Melt the bacon fat, mince the
  vegetables and add to the pan with the herbs. Cook slowly for 15
  minutes until vegetables are soft. Set aside and deglaze pan with the
  madeira. Reserve the liquid. Melt in a heavy saucepan the drippings.
  Add the Matignon and reheat it. Add the flour, heat and stir until
  browned. Then add the pepper, tomatoes, parsley and stir. Add the
  stock and simmer gently until liquid reduced by half, about 2-2 1/2
  hrs. Stir occasionally and skim fat off the top as it accumulates.
  Strain the sauce and stir occasionally as it cools to avoid skimming.
  There should be about 6 cups. Set aside 5 cups for other brown sauces
  later and take one cup for the last step. In a saucepan, gently
  simmer red wine with pepper until reduced to 3/4. Add one cup of
  Espagnole and simmer 5 min. Add reserved madeira de-glazing liquid
  from step one and the diced marrow and poach it 5 min. Serve with
  game or beef chops, steaks, roasted Fillet Mignon, char boiled cuts
  and sweetbreads.

      4 qt Popped corn OR>>>>>>>>>>
      2 pk Microwave popcorn
      1 c  Spanish peanuts
    1/2    Stick butter (4 tb.)
      1 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  1) Preheat oven to 250 F. 2) Combine popcorn & peanuts in metal bowl
  (lge. roasting pan) and place in preheated oven. 3) Combine all
  remaining ingreds. in saucepan, and bring to boil over med. heat,
  stirring constantly until candy thermometer reaches 260 F., abt 20 to
  25 min. 4) Remove popcorn & peanuts from oven and, working quickly,
  pour the caramel mixture in a fine stream over them. Return to oven
  for 15 min. 5) Mix well every 5 min., so that all of the popcorn is
  coated evenly. Cool and store airtight to preserve freshness.
  
  Yield:  4 qts.
  
  In 1871 a German immigrant named F.W. Rueckheim came to Chicago with
  $200 in his pocket. He used all of his money to open a small popcorn
  shop in the city and started selling a sweet caramel and
  molasses-coated popcorn confection. Rueckheim's big break came in
  1893, when the treat was served at Chicago's first world's fair. From
  then on the popcorn's popularity grew enormously. In 1896 a salesman
  tasting the treat for the first time said, "Thats a cracker jack,"
  and the name stuck. Shortly after Cracker Jack's debut another
  customer commented, "The more you eat, the more you want," and that's
  still the slogan today.
       In 1912 the Cracker Jack Company started adding toy surprises,
  ranging from small books to minature metal toy trains. To date they
  have given away 17 billion toy surprises. In 1964 Borden, Inc. bought
  Cracker Jack Company, and today the Cracker Jack division is the
  largest user of popcorn in the world, popping more than 20 tons daily.

 Categories: Korean
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      2 tb Unhulled barley
      5 c  ;water; boiling
 
  "Koreans are not essentially tea drinkers like the Chinese or
  Japanese. Upon being seated in a Korean restaurant or home you are
  more than likely to be served a very pale-colored tea prepared from
  barley. This brew, which has a light earthy flavor, is considered to
  be a health tea, good for one's digestive system, especially if
  sipped after dining. I prefer to take the tea in small Chinese
  teacups at room temperature although it can be served quite warm or
  cooled in the refrigerator."
  
  1. Put the barley in a large skillet and toast over moderate heat for
  about 10 minutes until the grains have turned to a dark coffee color.
  Stir and shake the pan now and then during this time. Set aside and

      Title: BORLENGHE WITH LARDO & PROSCIUTTO
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        2 c  pasta flour
        1 ts salt
        1    egg, -- beaten
    5 1/2 c  water
      1/4 lb Lardo -- plus 2 tablespoons
      1/4 lb Prosciutto, -- minced
  :          finely
        2 TB finely chopped rosemary
  :          leaves
        2    cloves fresh garlic, --
  :          finely minced
        1 TB freshly ground black pepper
        2 c  freshly grated
  :          Parmigiano-Reggiano
  
  Combine the flour, salt and egg in a large mixing bowl. Add 2 cups
  water and beat with a whisk for 5 minutes or until very smooth.
  Quickly stir in remaining water. Allow to stand 1 hour. (The batter
  will appear very thin, almost milk-like, but do not worry).
  
  Stir together 1/4 cup lardo, prosciutto, rosemary, garlic and black
  pepper in a mixing bowl until smooth and set aside.
  
  To cook borlenghe, heat a 14- to 16-inch non-stick pan over medium
  heat and brush with a 1/4 teaspoon of remaining lardo. Pour enough
  batter to coat pan (just like a crespella) and return to heat. Cook 4
  minutes on the first side and turn carefully. (The texture will not
  be like a crespella, or anything else, for this is an original and
  distinct delicacy. It may crack, but keep going). Continue until all
  the batter is finished, or about 10 to
       12    borlenghe.
  
  To serve, reheat borlenghe quickly in same pan, spread with 1
  tablespoon prosciutto mixture, sprinkle with grated cheese and serve
  warm, folded into quarters.

  I have eaten at Country Life before it moved and it was quite good.
  It is a buffet with several main dishes, two soups, and an extensive
  salad bar. I don't think that it is VLF, but it is vegan and nothing
  is visibly oily. They do have nut butters and products made with tofu
  and other potentially high fat meat substitutes. I bought their
  cookbook, but I have not used it very much because a lot of their
  main dishes include nuts ands seeds or tofu as major ingredients. I
  think, though, that the restaurant is coming closer to VLF because
  someone there (the manager, perhaps) is a student at Tufts School of
  Nutrition and eats VLF herself. It is definitely worth a visit!!
  
  Country Life Restaurant 200 High Street (this is their new location)

  also:  their russian potato soup is quite possibly the yummiest thing
  I have ever eaten!

      Title: BOSTON BAKED BEANS (WHITE)
 Categories: Side dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Navy beans, pea beans or
           -other small dried white
           -beans
    1/2 lb Salt pork
      1 md Onion, cut in 1/2" dice
      4    Garlic cloves, fine chopped
      1 c  Tomato puree
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Dried mustard
    1/3 c  Maple syrup
    1/3 c  Molasses
      2    Bay leaves
      3 tb Cider vinegar
 
  This recipe, adapted from "Jasper White's Cooking From New England"
  (Harper & Row; 1989), may well be the ultimate American baked bean,
  just sweet enough from molasses and maple sugar.
  
  Pick through beans and discard off-colored or broken ones. Rinse and
  drain beans.
  
  Remove rind from half of salt pork. Cut into 1/2" squares. Cut other
  half into 3/4- to 1" thick strips to equal 4 or 5 strips, with rind
  attached. Set aside.
  
  Line bottom of earthenware crock or bean pot with 1/2" squares of
  salt pork and onion. Place beans on top.
  
  Bring 1 quart water to boil in saucepan. Add garlic, tomato puree,
  salt, pepper, mustard, maple sugar, molasses, bay leaves and vinegar.
  Simmer 1 minute. Mix well and pour over beans.
  
  Score strips of salt pork crosswise, about every inch, without cutting
  through. This prevents strips from curling while cooking. Place
  strips on top of beans and liquid. Cover pot and bake at 250'F. 5
  hours, checking occasionally (first at 2 hours, then every hour), to
  be sure liquid is just barely covering beans. Add more water as
  needed.
  
  After 5 hours, remove cover of bean pot and cook 1 hour more. Remove
  strips of salt pork and stir pot before serving. Makes 6-8 servings.

      Title: BOUDIN (SAUSAGE MAKING)
 Categories: Sausages, Meats
      Yield: 1 Sausage
 
      1 lb Hog or beef blood (1pint)
    1/2 lb Hog fat
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Cayenne
    1/2    Garlic clove
      2    Onions
 
  Mince the onions fine and fry them slightly in a small piece of the
  hog fat. Add the minced garlic. Hash and mince the remaining fat very
  fine and mix it thoroughly with the beef blood. Mix the onions,
  spices and herbs. When all mixed take the prepared casings or
  entrails and fill with the mixture, being careful to tie the casing
  at the further end before attempting to fill. Then tie the other end
  making the sausage into strings of about two feet. Wash them
  thoroughly on the outside after filling and then tie again in spaces
  of about three inches or less in length, being careful not to make
  too long. Place them to cook in a pot of tepid water never letting
  them boil as that would curdle the blood. Let them remain on the slow
  fire till you can prick the sausage with a needle and no blood will
  exude. Then take them out, let them dry and cool
  
  Boudins are always fried in boiling lard. Some broil them, however.

  2 1/2 c  Freshly cooked white rice
      1 tb Dried sage leaves

    1\2 c  coarsely chopped green onions 2 1\2 t cayenne Boudin is the
  French term fo the blood sausage, or "pudding," made with the blood
  of the pig. Boudin blanc is a white sausage made with pork but no
  blood. This Louisiana version adds rice and is even whiter. Makes 3
  sausages, each about 30 inches long.
    Place the sausage casing in a bowl.  Pour in enough warm water to
  cover it and soak for 2 - 3 hours, until it is soft and pliable.
    Meanwhile, put the pork in a heavy 4-5 quart casserole and add
  enough water to cover it by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat
  and skim off the foam and scum that rise to the surface. Add 2 cups
  of onion, the bayleaf, peppercorns and 1 tsp salt. Reduce heat to low
  and simmer, partially covered, for
    1 1/2    hours.
    With a slotted spoon, transfer the chunks of pork to a plate. Put
  the pork, the remaining 2 cups of onions, the green pepper, parsley,
  green onions and garlic through the medium blade of a food grinder
  and place the mixture in a deep bowl.  Add the rice, sage, cayenne
  and black pepper and the remaining 4 tsp of salt. Knead vigourously
  with both hands, then beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture is
  smooth and fluffy. Taste for seasoning.
    To make each sausage, tie a knot 3 inches from one end of a length
  of the casing.  Fit the open end over the funnel (or "horn") on the
  sausage making attachment of a meat grinder.  Then ease the rest of
  the casing onto the funnel, squeezing it up like the folds of an
  accordion.
    Spoon the meat mixture into the mouth of the grinder and, with a
  wooden pestle, push it through into the casing. As you fill it, the
  casing will inflate and gradually ease away from the funnel in a
  ropelike coil. Fill the casing to within an inch or so fo the funnel
  end but do not try to stuff  it too tightly, or it may burst. Slip
  the casing off the funnel and knot the open end. You may cook the
  sausages immediately or refrigerate them safely for five or six days.
    Before cooking a sausage, prick the cawsing in five or six places
  with a skewer or the point of a small sharp knife. Melt 2 Tbsp of
  butter with 1 Tblsp of oil in a heavy 12 inch skillet set over
  moderate heat. When the foam begins to subside, place the sausage in
  the skillet, coiling it in concentric circles. Turning the sausage
  with tongs, cook uncovered for about 10 minutes, or until it is brown
  on both sides.

      Title: BOUDIN DU PAYS (BLOOD PUDDING)
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Pork blood
           -Salt
      2 lb Pork, fresh
      1    Pig's lung
    1/2    Pig's heart
      2    Pig necks
           -Salt
      5    Onions; chopped
           -Salt & pepper
           Cloves
           Summer Savory
           Coriander seeds; crushed
           -to taste
      2 tb Flour
 
  SAUCE A BOUDIN: When slaughtering a pig, collect the fresh blood,
  immediately add salt and stir to prevent coagulation. Cut the fresh
  pork, the lung, heart and neck into large pieces. Place the meat into
  a large pot and add just water to cover the meat. Add the salt and 3
  chopped onions. Simmer on medium heat for 3 hours. Remove the meat
  from the cooking liquid and let it cool. Cut the meat into very small
  pieces or grind it with a meat grinder. Add the meat to the cooking
  liquid with the 2 remaining onions, pepper and spices. Bring the
  liquid to a boil and slowly add the blood by pouring it through a
  sieve. Stir constantly. Add the flour, mixed with a small amounts of
  water. (The flour may be browned in the oven before being add to the
  meat, provided that slightly more flour is used.) Simmer the mixture
  on low heat for approximately 1 hour, stirring frequently. This sauce
  may served later by warming in a skillet. BOUDIN DES BRANCHES (BLOOD
  PUDDING SAUSAGES): To make blood pudding sausages, prepare blood
  pudding sauce but do not simmer for the last half hour. Rather, clean
  the small intestines of the pig, cut them into 20 inch pieces at tie
  them at one end. Using a funnel or a piece of birch bark as was the
  Acadian tradition, fill the intestinal lining with the sauce until
  the intestine is three quarters full. press out the air and tie the
  other end, leaving some space for expansion. Put the branches in
  boiling water and cook for 45 to 1 hour.

      Title: BOUDIN SAUSAGE
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Lean pork or veal
      2    Onions, chopped
    1/2    Bunch chopped green onions
      2 c  Cloves, minced
    1/2    Bunch chopped parsley
    1/2 ts Thyme
      2    Bay leaves
      1 tb Salt, or to taste
      1 ts Ground white pepper, or to
           Taste
      1 ts Cayenne, or to taste
      2 c  Water
      3 c  Cooked rice
      4 ts Twenty-inch long cleaned
           Sausage casings.
      1    Pepper
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Fred Towner Originally from: "The 100
  Greatest Dishes of Louisiana", by Roy F. Guste, Jr. BOUDIN: Mince the
  pork or veal and put it in a pot with the chopped onions, green
  onions, garlic, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, salt, pepper(s), and
  cayenne. Add just enough water to meet the level of the ingredients.
  Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Put the ingredients into a
  bowl and stir in the cooked rice. Adjust seasonings if necessary. Tie
  the 4 sausage casings at one end and stuff them with the mixture.
  Twist each 20-inch length into three equal lengths. Tie open end.
  
  The boudin can be cooked covered in a little water, grilled or pan
  fried in a little butter. Cut the sausages and serve 2 to each person.
  
  Serves 6
  
  VARIATIONS:
  
  This dish is a good one to learn because once you have mastered its
  preparation you can use almost anything in the place of the pork or
  veal. Some of the most popular are chicken, shrimp, crabmeat, and
  crayfish.
  
  Bread is a traditional but not as good replacement for the rice.
  
  NOTE: This is a great dish to make and it freezes well. Many people
  cut the casing off the boudin before eating it.

      Title: BOUGATSA
 Categories: Desserts, Greek
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
    1/2 lb Cream cheese
      1 lb Fresh ricotta cheese
      1 lb Fresh lg-curd cottage cheese
           Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
     18    Sheets commercial filo
    1/2 c  Butter (or more); melted
 
  Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese at high speed until
  light and fluffy.  Lower the speed and add the ricotta, cottage
  cheese, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, and the nutmeg. Beat for 1 minute at
  high speed, then set aside while you prepare the filo.
      Lay the filo flat on a table and keep covered with a damp towel
  over waxed paper or plastic wrap.  By stacking 4 sheets, form a base
  of 15 x 18 inches, brushing the top of each sheet with melted butter
  as you stack them.  Then lay 2 sheets at right angles over the
  center, using the "base" as a diamond, not a square, brushing the
  center of each with butter. Divide the filling into 3 parts and
  spread one part over the filo to form a 7-inch square.  Set the rest
  of the filling aside. Fold the top filo sheet over the cheese and
  brush with butter, and continue folding the filo over the cheese to
  make a square, brushing each time with butter. With a wide spatula,
  lift the bougatsa and invert onto a cookie sheet. Brush the top with
  butter and set aside.
      Repeat with the remaining filo, filling until all 3 square pies
  are folded.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until
  the filo puffs up and turns a golden chestnut color. Cut into small
  squares and sprinkle with additional sugar.  Serve piping hot.

      1 ts Saffron threads
      2 ts Pernod
      2    Baguettes (French bread) cut
           -diagonally into thin slices
      2 lg Garlic cloves, peeled
      1    Rouille (see recipe)
 
  * such as sea bass, flounder, red snapper, grouper, perch, sole, pike,
  haddock, and cod. ** (remove fins, skin, etc. and all traces of
  blood) *** peeled, cored, seeded and chopped. **** 1 bay leaf, 1
  thyme sprig, 6 parsley sprigs pinch each of grated orange peel,
  ground fennel seeds, basil, and oregano.
  
  Provencal fish stew with garlic toast and Red Pepper Mayonnaise
  
  Fillet the fish or have your fishmonger do it for you. Save the
  bones. Cut the fish into 1-in (2.5-cm) chunks. Marinate with 2
  tablespoons olive oil, 1 clove chopped garlic, a few saffron threads,
  and a pinch of thyme for at least 1 hour.
  
  Saute the onions and remaining chopped garlic in 4 tablespoons olive
  oil for 4 minutes. Add the fish bones, tomatoes, bouquet garni,
  orange peel, fennel seeds, basil, oregano, carrots, leeks, salt and
  pepper, and cook covered for 10 minutes. Add the water and 1 cup of

  heat. Blend the mixture in a blender for a few seconds and then
  strain it into a soup pot through a fine strainer lined with
  cheesecloth. Discard the residue in the strainer. Taste the stock for
  seasoning. If it tastes a little thin, reduce over high heat for a
  few minutes until the flavor is more fully developed.
  
  Add the clams and simmer until they just begin to open. Add the fish
  and the remaining wine and cook at a rolling boil for 10 minutes. Add
  the saffron threads and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. Taste
  and season with Pernod, salt and pepper. Pour into warmed individual
  bowls.
  
  Meanwhile dry the baguette slices in the oven for a few minutes and
  then rub them with the whole cloves of garlic. Top the slices of
  bread with plenty of rouille and float them in the bowls of soup.
  Serve immediately.

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           See Part 1
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Marseille-style fish soup -- A friend and I had been talking about
  the glories of bouillabaisse for the past year and we finally decided
  to use New Year's Eve as an excuse to fish rather than continuing to
  cut bait, ad nauseam.  The following recipes are a combination of
  several derived from old issues of _Gourmet_, Julia Child, the
  "Playboy Gourmet Cookbook," and "gee, that sounds good, let's add it."
  
  *  The accompanying Rouille is a garlic-hot pepper mayonnaise
  condiment traditional to Marseille-style fish soup. Rouille is
  traditionally made with a mortar and pestle but I prefer to use a
  food processor, it's just too much work otherwise. Pass the rouille
  as a condiment. Usually about 1 T per serving is sufficient, this
  stuff is the essence of garlic and hot pepper.
  
  *  If you can't get fish trimmings for the court bouillon, add
  bottled clam juice and shrimp and lobster shells.
  
  *  To be truly authentic, our bouillabaisse should have included eel,
  but my friend was a bit squeamish about that so we left it out.
  Basically, any combination of shellfish and firm-fleshed fish can be
  used with the more variety the better.  I dislike using crab since it
  flakes so easily and is lost in the broth. If you can't get live
  lobsters, substitute frozen lobster tails but be careful not to
  overcook.
  
  *  Use saffron threads, rather than saffron powder which tends to be
  adulterated with safflower and not the same thing at all. Be
  conservative with the saffron, a little goes a long way and can give
  the dish a medicinal taste.
  
  *  We preceded our dinner with herbed leek and prosciutto tartlets
  served with champagne. Dinner included bouillabaisse; a
  hearts-of-palm salad with pimento and greek olives and vinaigrette
  dressing; lots of crusty french bread to soak up the broth; a dry
  white wine (Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc '84); and my friend's mother's
  sponge cake with whipped cream icing, fresh raspberries and raspberry
  sauce, accompanied by Asti Spumante.

      Title: BOURBON MARINATING OR BASTING SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Rubs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Lard
      2 tb Hot red chili powder
      2 tb Mild red chili powder
      1    Onion -- finely chopped
      1 tb Minced garlic
     14 oz Tomato puree
    1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  Yellow mustard
    1/2 c  Brown sugar -- firmly
           Packed
    1/4 c  Bourbon
      3 dr Liquid smoke
 
  Place the lard in a large, non reactive saucepan and saute the onion
  and garlic until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining
  ingredients and continue cooking for about another 30 minutes. Stir
  frequently to prevent sauce from burning. Allow to rest for at least
  an hour before using.
  
  This is a marinating or basting sauce. To marinate, coat the meat
  with the sauce and leave in the refrigerator, covered, over night, or
  about 8 to 12 hours. Continue to baste with the sauce as the meat
  cooks. It's NOT a table sauce, but works best when cooked into the
  meat. Best with pork or beef.
  
  Makes about 2 cups.

      Title: BOUREK (BEEF-STUFFED PASTRY ROLLS)
 Categories: Algerian, Hamburger, Holiday
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 sm Onion; chopped (1/4 cup)
    1/2 lb Ground beef
    1/2 ts Salt; or to taste
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1    Egg; beaten
      2 tb Flat leaf parsley; chopped
      6    Phyllo sheets; 12x17" ea
           Lemon wedges for serving
 
  When the fast of Ramadhan is broken in the early evening hours,
  various dishes are considered a traditional part of the meal. This is
  one of those dishes.
  
  1. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a skillet, add the onion and
  stir-fry over moderate heat for 2 minutes. Add the beef, salt and
  pepper and stir-fry for 5 minutes. Add the egg and parsley and fry
  for 1 minute more. Cool well.
  
  2. Take 1 phyllo sheet and spread it out flat with a short end
  nearest you. Place 2 heaping tablespoons of the beef mixture 2 inches
  in from the short edge. Fold both long sides in toward the middle,
  beginning with the short end roll the phyllo to shape a packet 4
  inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Repeat with all the remaining
  phyllo sheets and stuffing. Set aside.
  
  3. Put the balance of the oil in a skillet over moderate/low heat and
  add the rolls. Brown on both sides for about 3 minutes; the low heat
  prevents the very thin pastry sheets from burning. Drain the rolls on
  paper towels for a minute.
  
  Serve warm with a squeeze of lemon juice. Makes 6.

      6 bn Scallions
           -(white part & 1" green)
           -chopped, to make about 3 c.
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    3/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      8    Filo pastry sheets; thawed
      2 tb Sesame seeds
 
  Toss the chopped scallions in a bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil, the
  chopped dill, salt and pepper.
  
  Remove 8 sheets of filo from the package. Reseal package and
  refrigerate it.  Cover the filo you are using with a damp dish towel,
  well wrung out, and try to work hastily, as the pastry sheet have a
  tendency to dry out.
  
  Lay out one sheet of filo and brush thoroughly with olive oil. Lay a
  second sheet over the first, and brush again with olive oil. Leaving
  a margin of 1 inch down one short side of the filo, sprinkle
  one-fourth of the scallion mixture in a strip.  Roll up from the same
  side, to make a long tube, packing the ends well. Place on a greased
  baking sheet.
  
  Repeat this procedure three more times.  Cut each tube diagonally
  into four sections, brush with olive oil, and sprinkle the tops with
  sesame seeds. Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F until the tops are
  crisp and golden brown - about 30 minutes.  They are good hot or cold.

      Title: BOURSIN MASHED POTATOES
 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb All purpose potatoes, peel
           And cut into 2 inch chunks
      2 pk Imported French Boursin
           Cheese with garlic and herbs
    1/2 c  Whole milk or half & half
           Salt and Freshly ground
           Pepper to taste
 
  Directions; 1. Place the peeled potatoes in large pot, cover with
  water. Bring to boil cook 20 -25 minutes until potatoes are tender
  and done. Drain potatoes in colander. Return the potatoes to pot and
  cook over low heat 30 seconds to evaporate any water remaining. 2.
  With hand held mixer mash, potatoes until smooth. Add the two
  packages of Boursin cheese and continue beating until thoroughly
  incorporated. Thin mashed potatoes with milk or half & half, beat 1
  minute more. 3. Add salt and pepper to taste. 4. Transfer the mashed
  potatoes to ovenproof casserole and rewarm by baking in 350 F. or
  microwaving until piping hot. Serve at once.
  
  Note: Boursin is a soft and rich French cheese laced with garlic and
  herbs. It is widely available in America and just happens to make one
  of the easiest and most sensational tasting mashed potato recipes in
  the world.

  leaves. Simmer the beans, partially covered, until almost tender,
  about 1 hour. Add 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook the beans until
  tender, about 15 minutes longer. Drain. Discard the garlic clove and
  bay leaves.
  
  In a large frying pan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the
  minced garlic and the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
  onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, sun-dried
  tomatoes, red-pepper flakes and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Cook
  until the beans and tomatoes are heated through, about 2 minutes.
  
  In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the bow ties until just
  done, about 15 minutes.  Reserve about 2 tablespoons of the pasta
  water. Drain the bow ties and return them to the hot pot. Add the
  bean mixture, pasta water, arugula, Parmesan and vinegar and toss.
  
  Beans and Salt: Salt and acidic ingredients, such as tomatos and
  vinegar, make it difficult for dried beans to absorb liquid. This
  means that dried beans must always be cooked until soft in unseasoned
  water. Otherwise, they remain tough.  But don't forget the salt
  completely. When the beans are almost done, season them for optimum
  flavor.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      2 md Onions, chopped
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      2    Jalapeno peppers, chopped
      1    Mild pepper, chopped
      1    Red pepper, chopped
      1    Green pepper, chopped
      2 lg Tomatoes, diced
      8 oz Tomato sauce
      2 cn Rotel Tomatoes and Chilis
      2    15-oz cans dark red kidney
           Beans
      3 c  Water
      4 tb Chili powder
      2 tb Cumin
      1 tb Paprika
      1 tb Oregano
      1 tb Lemon juice
           Salt, pepper to taste
           Tabasco to taste
      1 c  Textured Vegetable Protein
 
   Saute onions, garlic, and peppers in oil until onions are
  translucent. Add spices and simmer for two minutes. Stir in remaining
  ingredients, adding the TVP last. You can adjust the amount of TVP to
  obtain the desired texture and consistency. You can substitute beer
  for the water for a more unique flavor. One jalapeno makes a mild
  chili (two were used for the cookoff). Simmer from four to six hours.
  It's even better the next day.

  the 4th Annual Lone Star Vegetarian Chili Cookoff held in Dallas in
  October. It was submitted by the Animal Connection of Texas members

      Title: BOXWALLAH'S CHUTNEY
 Categories: Relishes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Rhubarb, trimmed weight
      1 lb Onions
    1/2 lb Raisins
    1/2 lb Sultanas
    1/2 oz Coriander seeds
      2 ts Curry powder
      6 oz Granulated sugar
    3/4 pt Raspberry vinegar
           -OR- red wine vinegar
 
  Cut the trimmed rhubarb into short lenghths and chop the onions quite
  finely.  Put both ingredients into a large pan and pour on the
  vinegar. Then lightly bruise the whole coriander seeds. Add the seeds
  direct to the pan if you want to include them in the chutney.  I love
  their spicy bite but some people complain that the seeds stick
  between their teeth, so you may prefer to tie them in a piece of
  buttermuslin and remove before potting.  Bring the contents of the
  pan slowly to boiling point, cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes
  or so to start softening the onion.
  
  Add the dried fruits, sugar, curry powder and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt.
  Stir to mix well.  Then continue simmering - this time without a lid
  ~ for 1 1/2 hours or so until the rhubarb has pulped down completely,
  the flavour is mellow, and the colour is rich and the consistency is
  thick. Stir the chutney occasionally as it cooks to prevent sticking,
  particularly towards the end. Pot in warm sterilised jars and allow
  to mature for at least one month before eating.  The longer you can
  resist eating this chutney the better it seems to taste.

  *** The recipe specified "butter and lard mixed" for "shortening".
  Wash the meat, cover with water, add seasonings to taste and cook
  slowly for several hours. Wash and peel the potatoes and cut into
  thin slices. Cook until tender. Drain off all of the water, add the 3
  Tbsp of butter, salt and pepper to taste, parsley and onion. Mix
  well. Beat the eggs, add to potatoes and beat mixture lightly. Let
  stand until pastry is made. Sift together the flour, baking powder
  and 1/2 tsp salt. Work in the 4 Tbsp of shortening and then add the
  water, using only enough to hold dough together. Roll thin on a
  floured board and cut into large circles, about 10 inches in
  diameter, spread with some of the potato mixture, fold dough to form
  a semi-circle, pressing edges together with prongs of fork. Drop into
  the hot meat and broth, cover pot closely and boil about 25 minutes.
  While these are cooking make a sauce of the 3 Tbsp of butter or bacon
  drippings, add the bread cubes and brown. Stir in the milk. Arrange
  the "Boova Shenkel" on a platter and pour over all the milk sauce.

      2 lb Boneless round steak;

    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese

      2    Hard boiled eggs; sieved

   Mix together bread crumbs, cheese, garlic, beaten egg, pepper and

  Spread 1 cup spaghetti sauce in bottom of baking pan slightly larger
  than meat roll. Place meat on sauce and cover with remaining
  sauce.Cover and bake at 350 degrees F. for 2 to 3 hours, or until
  fork tender. Serve on top of spaghetti.
   JEAN'S SUGGESTION:  This might cook very well in a crockpot with a
  meat rack, on LOW for 6 to 8 hours, or until very tender. In that
  case, I would lower the amount of spaghetti sauce used, to 3/4 to 1
  cup, to allow for the meat juices that would cook out.

  PIKE STREET, SEATTLE WINE: BAROLO, CAVALOTTO, 1971 1.Open the
  butterflied steak and, with waxed paper covering it, pound evenly
  with a meat mallet until approximately 1/4 inch thick. Rub the lemon
  rind, salt, pepper, and 1-1/2 Tsp. oregano into the meat. 2.Lay the
  prosciutto slices evenly on the steak. Sprinkle the bread crumbs,
  grated Parmesan, & parsley evenly over the prosciutto slices. Roll
  the braciole tightly, taking care while rolling to tuck in both ends
  so as to hold in the filling while cooking. Tie the roll with strings
  at 1-1/2 to 2 in. intervals. 3.Rub the rosemary between your palms to
  break it up. Season the flour with the rosemary, remaining oregano,
  and salt and pepper. Rub this mixture onto the surface of the beef
  roll. 4.In a pan large enough to hold the roll, heat the olive oil
  over moderately high heat. Add the beef roll, turning to brown the
  entire sur- face. 5.Add the garlic and onion and cook until the
  garlic begins to turn golden brown.
  
  Add the wine and cook for one minute. 6.Add the tomatoes with their
  juice and salt & pepper to taste. Cover the pan and simmer over low
  heat for 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until very tender when pierced with a
  fork. If liquid app- ears to be diminishing during the cooking,
  splash a bit more wine into the pan. 7.Remove from pan & place on a
  heated platter. Remove the strings, cut into 1/2 in. thick sli- ces,
  pour the tomato mixture over the slices and serve. Note: If serving
  cold, place the braciole on a platter, pour the sauce over it, cover
  tightly with plastic wrap or foil, and refrigerate. Before serving,
  bring to room temperature, remove the strings, and cut into slices as
  mentioned previously. The slices can be served on a bed of lettuce,
  accompanied by freshly baked bread.

      2 lb Roundsteak, sliced 1/2 inch
           -thick and twice-tenderized
           -by the butcher
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Fresh ground black pepper
    3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
      1 lg Egg
      1 tb Hot red pepper sauce
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
           Crisco for deep frying

MMMMM--------------------CLASSIC CREAM GRAVY-------------------------
    1/4 c  Pan drippings
      3 tb All-purpose flour
      2 c  Evaporated milk
      1 c  Unsalted beef stock
    1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
           Salt to taste

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
           Mashed potatoes
           Homemade buttermilk biscuits
 
    Cut steak into 4 equal portions. Pound until each is about 1/4 inch
  thick. Place flour in a shallow bowl. In a second dish, stir together
  baking powder, soda, pepper and salt; mix in buttermilk, egg, pepper
  sauce and garlic. The mixture will be thin.
    Dredge each steak first in flour, then in batter. Dunk steaks back
  into flour and dredge well, patting in the flour until the surface of
  the meat is dry.
    Add enough shortening to a deep cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven to
  deep fry steaks in at least 4 inches of fat. Bring temperature of
  shortening to 325 degrees. Fry the steaks, pushing them under the fat
  or turning them as they bob to the surface, for 7 to 8 minutes, or
  until they are golden brown. Drain steaks on paper towels and
  transfer to a platter. Keep warm while preparing Classic Cream Gravy.
    Divide steaks among 4 plates and serve with mashed potatoes and
  gravy. CLASSIC CREAM GRAVY:
    After cookingf chicken-fried steak or similar dish, pour off the
  top fat through a strainer, leaving about 1/2 cup pan drippings in
  the bottom of the skillet. Return any browned cracklings from the
  strainer to the skillet before starting the gravy.
    Place skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour, stirring to
  avoid lumps. Add milk and stock. Simmer until liquid is thickened and
  the raw flour taste is gone, about 3 minutes. Stir the gravy up from
  the bottom frequently, scraping up any browned bits. Season with
  pepper and salt. Makes about 3 cups.

  Heat apple juice in nonstick skillet.  Add enough potatoes to more or
  less form one layer.  Sprinkle the chopped up canadian bacon on top.
  Stir/turn over a couple of times, several minutes apart, to prevent
  excess sticking (I like crisp potatoes so I let it stick a bit).
  
  While potatoes are cooking, mix up gravy mix (I was so brain damaged
  I just microwaved some leftover gravy that I found in the fridge
  :-), pour over potatoes to taste and eat.
  
  Some good bread to sop up the gravy would be a plus. Next time I'll

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 cn Fatfree refried beans
      1    Low fat tortillas (ww or
           Corn)
 
  Turn the oven on hot (I use a pizza stone, but I'm sure it's not
  necessary).  Open a can of fatfree refried beans and spread thinly on
  half of a low-fat tortilla (whole wheat or corn). Fold the other half
  the tortilla over the beans, and smash down.  Make several. Bake
  until slightly crispy, turning once if desired. To eat, dip in salsa.
  These are kind of like quesadillas without the queso.

      Title: BRAIN-DEAD FOOD: CURRY RICE & SPINACH
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Box Near East Curry Rice
      1    Box frozen spinach
      1 cn Black beans
      1 cn Diced tomatoes (slightly
           Drained)
 
  I might have posted this before, but one of my favorite brain-dead
  foods (outside of spaghetti), is to take one box of Near-East Curry
  Rice and cook according to directions, without the added fat.  While
  that is cooking, microwave 1 frozen block of spinach (for some reason
  fresh spinach doesn't taste as good to me in this recipe -- and takes
  longer unless already de-stemmed and washed).  When that is done,
  drain and set aside. Nuke 1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed,
  and 1 can of diced tomatoes (minus some of the juice), mixed together
  (generally for about 3 minutes).
  
  When rice is done, mix spinach, rice, beans and tomatoes (generally
  in a large bowl).  Snarf.   Not only does it taste good, but it's
  really colorful with the yellow rice, black beans, red tomatoes and
  green spinach. Very satisfying.  Even my almost-3-yr-old loves it.
  
  Approximate total time: 25-30 minutes (time to cook rice)

 Categories: Chinese, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ts Red rice vinegar
      2 tb Medium sherry
    3/4 c  Stock
           Cornstarch paste
  1 1/2 lb Boned pork butt
      3 tb Peanut oil
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Water
      1 c  Fine plain bread crumbs
      4 c  Oil for deep-frying

MMMMM---------------------------PASTE--------------------------------
      2 tb Cooked rice
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Dry baker's yeast
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Warm water
      1 ts Wet bean cheese (opt)
 
  Prepare Paste:  Use mortar and pestle to pulverize cooked rice.
  Combine with sugar, yeast, soy and warm water. Let stand in warm
  place for 30 minutes to activate yeast. Authentic wine lees paste is
  not available in the U.S. to our knowledge, this is the best
  substitute we have found. You can add wet bean cheese for a sharper
  flavor.
  
  Braise Pork:  Slice pork butt across the grain into strips, 1" by 3"
  by 1/2" thick. Heat peanut oil in wok until it begins to smoke. Add
  some of pork to hot oil; stir-fry pieces until they lose their
  pinkness; repeat in batches until all pork is browned.  Next, add
  garlic to wok; stir briefly. Pour in wine lees paste, rice vinegar,
  sherry and stock; bring to slow boil; add pork slices. Reduce heat,
  cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
  
  Remove pork, without sauce, to large platter.  Cool pork. Cooling is
  essential so that it will deep-fry properly. Reserve sauce in small
  pan. You can hold pork for several hours, if you wish to braise it in
  advance.
  
  Deep-fry Pork:  Heat deep-frying oil in wok.  While oil is heating,
  beat egg yolks with water; set out bread crumbs on platter. Dip pork
  pieces in egg mixture, then bread crumbs, to thoroughly cover.
  
  When oil is at deep-frying temperature, 375 degrees, slip in a slice
  of pork as a test: pork should lightly brown in about 1 minute. Place
  6 pork slices on Chinese strainer, and lower into oil, strainer and
  all. Check in 2 minutes (browning should take slightly longer than
  test because strainer cools the oil). If you prefer to fry in larger
  batches, use more oil. Remove fried pork to warm platter, uncovered.
  
  Finish:  Reheat sauce, and pour over pork just before serving.

      1 ts Water
      1 c  Fine plain bread crumbs
      4 c  Oil for deep-frying

MMMMM---------------------------PASTE--------------------------------
      2 tb Cooked rice
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Dry baker's yeast
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Warm water
      1 ts Wet bean cheese (opt)
 
  Prepare Paste:  Use mortar and pestle to pulverize cooked rice.
  Combine with sugar, yeast, soy and warm water. Let stand in warm
  place for 30 minutes to activate yeast. Authentic wine lees paste is
  not available in the U.S. to our knowledge, this is the best
  substitute we have found. You can add wet bean cheese for a sharper
  flavor.
  
  Braise Pork:  Slice pork butt across the grain into strips, 1" by 3"
  by 1/2" thick. Heat peanut oil in wok until it begins to smoke. Add
  some of pork to hot oil; stir-fry pieces until they lose their
  pinkness; repeat in batches until all pork is browned.  Next, add
  garlic to wok; stir briefly. Pour in wine lees paste, rice vinegar,
  sherry and stock; bring to slow boil; add pork slices. Reduce heat,
  cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
  
  Remove pork, without sauce, to large platter.  Cool pork. Cooling is
  essential so that it will deep-fry properly. Reserve sauce in small
  pan. You can hold pork for several hours, if you wish to braise it in
  advance.
  
  Deep-fry Pork:  Heat deep-frying oil in wok.  While oil is heating,
  beat egg yolks with water; set out bread crumbs on platter. Dip pork
  pieces in egg mixture, then bread crumbs, to thoroughly cover.
  
  When oil is at deep-frying temperature, 375 degrees, slip in a slice
  of pork as a test: pork should lightly brown in about 1 minute. Place
  6 pork slices on Chinese strainer, and lower into oil, strainer and
  all. Check in 2 minutes (browning should take slightly longer than
  test because strainer cools the oil). If you prefer to fry in larger
  batches, use more oil. Remove fried pork to warm platter, uncovered.
  
  Finish:  Reheat sauce, and pour over pork just before serving.

      Title: BRAISED CHICKEN WITH BACON (CLAY POT)
 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5 lb Chicken
      4    Strips bacon
      1    Onion, finely chopped
      1    Clove garlic, finely chopped
      1 c  Chicken broth

           Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Tb. cornstarch dissolved in
      2    Tb. cold water
      2    Tb. finely chopped parsley
           -or chives
 
  Last weekend I finally managed to find good romertopf. A big one++ big
  enough for a small turkey!  And am I glad. This is a neat way to
  cook. I fixed the following recipe and it came out great. I fudged it
  a bit++added a couple of quartered taters, three cut up carrots and a
  couple of cut up celery stalks. Everything came out cooked to
  perfection.
  
  After getting it, I went to the bookshelf and rummaged around for
  possible recipes and came across a book I'd forgotten I even had.
  These recipes are from it.  This recipe is the only one I've actually
  fixed, but if the rest are as good, I'll be impressed.  I had
  expected the chicken to have a soft, steamed skin, but the parts that
  were above the liquid were nicely browned.
  
  Here are some chicken ones, one for osso bucco and one for a New
  England boiled dinner that looks outrageous.
  
  In the book, Chalmers says that nearly any recipe can be adapted to
  the clay pot cookers by adding a hundred degrees to the listed
  temperature and adding half an hour to the cooking time.
  
  Soak the clay pot in cold water for 10 minutes.  Truss the chicken
  securely and sit it in the pot, breast side up. Cut the bacon into
  small pieces and fry until crisp. Drain the bacon and scatter it over
  the chicken breast. Add the onion, garlic, chicken broth, salt and
  pepper.
  
  Cover the pot and place it in a cold oven.  Adjust the heat to 450F
  and cook for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Drain the juices into a small saucepan.  Bring to boiling point and
  stir in the cornstarch dissolved in cold water. Add the chives or
  parsley to the sauce and pour it over the chicken. The chicken will
  be so utterly tender you will not have any difficulty carving it
  right out of the pot. Serve with rice or noodles and a tomato salad.
  
  Serves 4 and 2 children

      Title: BRAISED DUCK WITH ORANGE-AND-LIME SAUCE (ZANZ
 Categories: African, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 lb To 5 1/2 pound duck
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      2 c  Chicken stock, fresh or
           -canned
     12    Whole cloves
      1    Fresh hot chili *
    1/2 c  Strained fresh orange juice
      2 tb Strained fresh lime juice
    1/2 c  Finely chopped sweet bell
           -pepper, preferably red
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Orange wedges or slices studded with whole cloves for garnish
  
  * about 1 1/2 to 2inches long, stemmed and seeded [The typical
  cautions about being careful with the things. S.C.]
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Pat the duck completely dry inside and out
  with paper towels, and remove the large chunks of fat from the
  cavity. Cut off the loose neck skin and truss the bird securely, then
  prick the surface around the thighs, the back and the lower part of
  the breast with a skewer or the point of a sharp knife.
  
  In a heavy 5- to 6-quart casserole, heat the oil over moderate heat
  until a light haze forms above it.  Add the duck and, turning it
  frequently with a slotted spoon or tongs, cook for about 15 minutes,
  or until it browns richly on all sides.  Transfer the duck to a plate
  and discard the fat remaining in the casserole. Pour in 1 cup of the
  chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat, meanwhile scraping
  in any brown particles that cling to the bottom and sides of the pan.
  Stir in the cloves and chill, then return the duck and the liquids
  that have accumulated around it to the casserole.
  
  Cover tightly and braise in the middle of the oven for 1 hour. Remove
  the duck to a plate, and with a large spoon skim as much fat as
  possible from the surface of the cooking liquid. Discard the cloves
  and chili.
  
  Add the remaining cup of stock to the casserole and, stirring and
  scraping in the brown bits that cling to the pan, bring to a boil
  over high heat. Mix in the orange juice, lime juice, sweet bell
  pepper and salt. Return the duck to the casserole and baste it with
  the simmering sauce. Cover tightly and return the duck to the oven
  for about 15 minutes. To test for doneness, pierce the thigh of the
  bird with the point of a small, sharp knife. The juice should trickle
  out a clear yellow; if it is slightly pink, cook the bird for another
  5 to 10 minutes.
  
  Place the duck on a heated platter and pour the sauce over it.
  Garnish the platter with the orange wedges or slices and serve at
  once.

 Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     12 ea Garlic cloves
      4 tb Olive oil
      4 lg Fennel bulbs
    1/3 c  Water
      8 ea Sprigs fresh rosemary
     12 ea Brine-cured black olives
           Salt and fresh ground pepper
           Lemon slices, for garnish
 
  Bring 2 to 3 cups of water to a boil in a small pot and blanch the
  garlic cloves for 3 to 4 minutes; drain. Heat 1 tb. of the oil in a
  small skillet over medium heat and brown the garlic until golden all
  over. Cut the leaf stalks and the hard butt ends from the fennel
  bulbs, leaving just the bulbous stem, a piece 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 inches
  long. Halve the small bulbs lengthwise; quarter the larger bulbs. In
  a large skillet, heat the remaining oil and the water over medium
  heat. Add the fennel in a single layer and the rosemary. (If you have
  more fennel than your skillet can accommodate in a single layer, save
  half the oil and rosemary to cook with half the fennel in a second
  batch.) Cover and cook the fennel, turning once or twice, until water
  cooks away and the fennel is tender and browning, about 15 minutes.
  If the fennel begins to brown before it feels tender, add a little
  more water; if it becomes tender before browning, raise the heat or
  take off the lid to speed browning. When the fennel is tender and
  browned, add the garlic and olives to warm through. Season to taste
  with salt and pepper. Garnish with lemon slices.

 Categories: Meats, Main dish, Low-cal, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Dried Cannellini, great
           - Northern or navy beans
      1 lg Head garlic
      1 tb Olive oil
      4    Lamb shanks, trimmed of fat
           - and membrane (1 pound)
      2 sm Carrots, peeled and diced
      1    Onion, chopped
      1    Stalk celery, diced
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Defatted beef stock
     28 oz Plum tomatoes, drained
           - (1 can)
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary -or-
           - 2 ts dried
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt and freshly ground
           - pepper to taste
 
  Sort beans, discarding any debris.  Rinse and place in a large bowl.
  Cover with cold water and let soak for at least 8 hours of overnight.
  Alternatively, in a large pot, cover beans with water and bring to a
  boil. Boil for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let stand for 1
  hour. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Remove as much of the outer husk
  of the garlic as possible without separating the colves. Wrap loosely
  in aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Unwrap foil and separate
  the cloves slightly so that they cook evenly. Wrap again and bake for
  30 minutes longer, or until the garlic is very soft.  Set aside to
  cool.  Increase oven temperature to 325 degrees. In a Dutch oven,
  heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil over medium-high heat. Add lamb shanks and
  brown on all sides. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels.
  Add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil to the pan, then add carrots,
  onions and celery; saute for 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Add
  wine and cook until it has reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in
  beef stock, tomatoes, rosemary and bay leaf. Peel half the roasted
  garlic cloves and add to the pan; bring to a boil. Return the meat to
  the pan, cover tightly and place in the oven. Bake for 1 1/2 to 2
  hours, turning the shanks occasionally, or until the meat is very
  tender. Meanwhile, drain beans and place in a large heavy pot. Add
  water to cover by about 4 inches and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
  low and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beans are
  tender. Drain. (This recipe can be prepared ahead to this point.
  Cover and refrigerate the stew and beans separately for up to 2 days.
  Lift off fat that has solidified on the surface of the stew and
  reheat before proceeding.) With tongs, transfer the shanks to a
  plate, cover and keep warm.  Remove bay leaf from the sauce and skim
  off fat.  Boil the sauce for about 5 minutes, or until slightly
  thickened. Peel the remaining roasted garlic and add to the sauce
  along with the drained beans.  Heat through and season with salt and
  pepper. Mound the bean mixture on a platter and place the lamb shanks
  on top. Serves 4. CALORIES: 445 PER SERVING; PROTEIN: 40 GRAMS; FAT:

      Title: BRAISED LAMB WITH FRUITS & NUTS
 Categories: Indian, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This Indian dish is anything but understated.  It piles flavour upon
  flavour to stunning effect and would overwhelm milk-fed lamb.
  Amazingly, for something so sumptuous, it is comparatively
  nutritionally sound, as it has been modified to eliminate most
  saturated fat. However it is not for the meal-in-a-moment cook.
  
  Cover 45 g of raisins and 30 g sultanas in boiling water. Leave to
  soak. Trim an 800 g boneless piece of young lamb (leg or shoulder) of
  all visible fat.  Put the piece in a large saucepan and add 3 cups of
  water, a tablespoon of lemon juice and 2 bay leaves.  Cover, bring to
  the boil, skim, and simmer very gently for about one hour or until a
  skewer glides into the meat with ease. Remove the meat, setting it
  aside, and reduce the stock over high heat to about 1/4 of a cup.
  Reserve the stock and wash the saucepan.
  
  Into a processor bowl put 2 large onions quartered, 6 cloves of
  garlic, 5 cm ginger roughly chopped, 1/2 tablespoon ground cardamom,
  2 tablespoons ground coriander, 1 teaspoon ground cloves, 1
  tablespoon white poppy seeds, 45 g ground almonds and 1 teaspoon
  black pepper. Process to a paste. Chop finely a generous handful of
  fresh mint and have ready 200 g plain yoghurt (low fat yoghurt can be
  used).
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons mono- or polyun- saturated oil in the saucepan, add
  onion and spice paste and fry, stirring, for about 3 minutes or until
  it is fragrant. Add the mint and yoghurt and simmer gently till the
  sauce is thick and creamy.  Return the meat to the saucepan, spooning
  the sauce over it, cover and braise gently until the meat is heated
  through. Add the reserved stock to the saucepan and stir through.
  Continue to simmer uncovered until the stock is completely reduced.
  Sprinkle over the meat and sauce 2 teaspoons garam masala, 1 teaspoon
  chilli powder and salt to taste if you regard it as necessary.
  
  In a frying pan, heat a little oil and gently fry the drained
  sultanas and raisins, together with 45 g blanched slivered almonds,
  for about 5 minutes. Add them to the saucepan and stir. Infuse a few
  strands of saffron in a tablespoon of boiling water and add 1 1/2
  teaspoons of rosewater. Stir this mixture into the saucepan and heat
  for a minute or so more.
  
  Slice the meat, which by now should be meltingly tender, and arrange
  on a serving dish.  Spoon the sauce over the meat. Serve with rice.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

  pie shells with the mixture. WIPE MORELS CLEAN. Cut larger ones in
  quarters, leave smaller ones whole. Bring 4 quarts of cold, salted
  water to a boil over high heat on the stove. Melt the butter in a
  medium skillet over medium heat and add the morels, garlic, shallots
  and salt. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the sherry and brandy.
  Increase the heat to high and cook until the liquid reduces by about
  2/3. Add the cream and cook until the liquid reduces to a saucelike
  consistency and is thick enough to coat a spoon. Remove from the heat
  and keep in a warm place until the pasta is finished cooking. Add the
  pasta to the boiling water, cook until desired doneness, drain and
  toss with the mushrooms. Place on a serving platter or in a large
  serving bowl and serve immediately. Can be prepared up to an hour in
  advance to this point and kept, covered, in the pan. TO FREEZE
  MUSHROOMS AND SAUCE, fill an airtight plastic freezer bag 3/4 full
  and squeeze out excess air. Label and place in freezer for up to 3
  months. Defrost at room temperature or on the defrost setting of a
  microwave.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Carrots
      1    Fennel Bulb
    1/2 lb French Beans
      1 lb New Potatoes
           Olive Oil
      4    Pork Chops
      1 pt Cider
      1    Onion, Peeled and finely
           -chopped
      1    Garlic Clove
      2 tb Finely Chopped Parsley
           Salt and Pepper
 
  Trim, peel and cut the carrots into three-inch lengths. Cut the top
  and bottom off the fennel and cut into quarter-inch slices and then
  in half. Trim the beans and wash the potatoes.
  
  Heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a shallow pan wide enough to
  take the chops surrounded by the vegetables in one layer. Lightly
  colour the chops and remove. Add the onion and saute for 10 minutes
  without colouring. This is important as you need to draw the sugars
  out from the onion which will help in the caramelisation. Add the
  garlic and the rest of the vegetables coating them thoroughly in the
  oil.
  
  Return the chops to the pan and pour over the cider. Bring to the
  boil, allow to reduce for five minutes, lower the heat so the liquid
  is at a bare simmer, season with salt and pepper, cover and cook for
  15 minutes, or until the meat is done. Remove and keep warm. Turn up
  the heat and continue cooking until the sauce becomes thick and coats
  the vegetables. Serve with the chops and a genorous sprinkling of
  parsley.

  2. Trim the root ends of the leeks close, but not so close that the
  layers separate. Cut off the dark green part of the leeks and reserve
  for another use. Lay the leeks flat on a cutting surface and split
  them in half lengthwise almost all the way through to within an inch
  of the root end, making sure they don't separate. Rinse the leeks
  under warm running water, scrubbing lightly with a vegetable brush to
  remove all the sand.
  
  3. Cook the leeks in the stock and butter over low heat in a partially
  covered ovenproof skillet until the liquid has almost evaporated,
  about 30 minutes.
  
  4. Preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  5. Pour the seasoning sauce over the leeks and bake uncovered for 20
  minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and place over high heat.
  Baste the leeks several times, until the sauce has reduced and
  caramelized, 3-5 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.

        3 TB unsalted butter
    1 1/2 c  chopped onion
        1 c  carrots -- chopped
      1/4 c  vegetable oil
        5 lb beef roast -- (chuck, rump
  :          or bottom round) covered
  :          with a layer of fat and tied
        2    cloves garlic -- each cut

  :          or
        1 ts dried thyme
  :          Salt and pepper
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a casserole large enough to hold
  the meat, heat the butter. When foaming subsides add the onions and
  carrots and saute for about 10 minutes or until they take on some
  color. With a slotted spoon remove them and reserve for later.
  
  Add the oil to the casserole and heat over high heat. Add the beef and
  brown the meat on all sides; this should take 15 minutes to get a deep
  golden color. Return the vegetables to the casserole, stuffing them
  underneath the meat. Add the garlic, tomatoes, bouquet garni. Heat the
  casserole until you hear it sizzle, drape the meat loosely with
  aluminum foil, cover the casserole tightly and place it in the lower
  third of the oven.
  
  Cook for 1 hour, turn the meat over, lower the heat to 325 and
  continue to cook until the beef is tender, another 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  Remove the meat to a platter. Strain cooking juices into a saucepan,
  pressing down hard on the vegetables to extract their liquid. Let
  liquid settle for a minute, then skim off surface fat. Heat the
  liquid and reduce slightly; adjust seasoning. Slice the roast and
  spoon the gravy over the top. Serve with braised carrots and boiled
  parslied potatoes (make extra for cold potato salad and beef salad
  next day).

  1 1/2 lb Calf's sweetbreads
    1/8 ts Ground mace
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Flour
      3 tb Flavorless cooking oil
      2 tb Finely minced shallots
      1 c  Dry sherry
      1 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Unsalted butter
           Lemon slices
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Pat the sweetbreads dry and peel and discard
  the most obvious membranes without breaking the sweetbreads into
  small pieces. Mix mace, salt and pepper with flour, and dust the
  sweetbreads, shaking off the excess. Heat the oil in a heavy,
  oven-proof frying pan over medium heat on the stove and add the
  sweetbreads. Cook until they are dark golden on both sides, about 5
  minutes per side. Do not crowd the pan or they won't brown. Tilt the
  pan and pour off any remaining oil and add the shallots, wine and
  broth and bring to a boil. Cover the skillet and transfer to the
  oven. Turn temperature to 325F and cook 35 minutes, turning once.
  Remove pan from oven and use a slotted spoon to transfer the
  sweetbreads to a platter. Add the cream to the cooking juices and
  quickly boil the liquid until it starts to become sauce-like, about
  10 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. When it's
  time for dinner, strain the sauce over the sweetbreads; decorate with
  slices of lemon.

      Title: BRAISED WHOLE FILLET OF SALMON (JULIA CHILD)
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Large carrot and onion cut
           -into neat 1/4-inch dice
      2    Or 3 tender celery stalks,
           -neatly diced
      2 tb Unsalted butter

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONINGS------------------------------
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
           And dried tarragon
      2 lb Skinless fillet of salmon
           -about 1/2 inch thick
  1 1/2 c  Dry white French vermouth
 
  MASTER RECIPE Braised Whole Fillet of Salmon in Wine and Aromatic
  Vegetables
  
  For 6 to 8 servings:
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:
  
  A no-stick frying pan for the diced vegetables; tweezers or pliers to
  remove bones; a lightly buttered baking dish that will just hold the
  fish comfortably (or an ovenproof baking and serving platter, or,
  lacking either, cut the fish in half crosswise, and reassemble it
  after cooking- the vegetables will mask the surgery); buttered wax
  paper to cover fish.
  
  THE AROMATIC VEGETABLES:
  
  Cook the diced vegetables slowly in the butter until quite tender but
  not browned- about 10 minutes. Season lightly with salt, pepper, and
  a big pinch of dried tarragon.
  
  PREPARING THE FISH:
  
  Go over the salmon carefully with your fingers to detect any little
  bones; pull them out with tweezers or pliers. Score the skin side of
  the fish. Dust with salt and pepper, and place best side up in the
  baking dish.
  
  ASSEMBLING:
  
  Spread the cooked diced vegetables over the fish, and pour 1/2 inch of
  vermouth around it.  Cover the fish with the wax paper, buttered side
  down.
  
  *Ahead-of-time note:
  
  May be assembled an hour or more ahead to this point; cover and
  refrigerate.
  
  BAKING:  12 to 15 minutes at 350F:
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Set the fish in the lower middle level,
  and, when beginning to bubble lightly, baste the surface with the
  liquid in the dish, basting several times again until the flesh feels
  lightly springy to the touch.
  
  Remove from the oven, and, holding the fish in place with a pot cover,
  drain the cooking juices into a saucepan. Slide the fish onto a hot
  platter; cover and keep warm while making the sauce.
  
  VARIATIONS:
  
  AU NATURAL:  Braised Salmon Served in Its Own Juices:
  
  Rapidly boil down the cooking juices in the saucepan until almost
  syrupy. Pour them over the fish and vegetables, and serve.
  
  AROMATIC WHITE BUTTER SAUCE:
  
  The usual and lovely butter sauce of modern cookery can be as rich and
  buttery as you wish-from 3 or 4 tablespoons to half a pound. Using the
  preceding boiled-down juices as a base, proceed to beat in the butter
  as in the lemon-butter sauce for the broiled fish on page 83.
  
  WINEY CREAM SAUCE:
  
  A reasonable and equally delectable compromise is a light veloute
  sauce made with the cooking juices, then boiled down with cream, as
  follows. Cook together 2 1/2 Tbs butter and 3 Tbs flour 2 minutes
  without coloring; off heat whisk in the hot braising juices and 1 cup
  heavy cream. Boil slowly until reduced to 1
      1/2    cups; season carefully.
  
  (Full details for veloute sauce are on page 272.) Either serve the
  fish cloaked in its vegetables and accompany with the sauce, or fold
  the vegetables into the sauce and spoon over the fish.

      1 tb Shredded or minced fresh
           -ginger
    1/2 c  Low-salt chicken broth
      1 tb Soy sauce or bean sauce
      1 ts Corn starch, mixed with 2
           -teaspoons water
      3    Green onions, thinly slice
           -on a sharp diagonal
           -(garnish)
 
  Soak mushrooms in warm water until caps are tender, 15 to 30 minutes;
  drain. Gently squeeze water from mushrooms then cut off and discard
  stems; thinly slice caps. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine 1
  tablespoon soy sauce, wine and cornstarch. Add shrimp and stir to
  coat. Set aside.
  
  Sprinkle fish lightly with salt and pepper; dredge in cornstarch and
  shake off excess or lightly sprinkle with cornstarch (fish does not
  need to be completely coated). Place a wide frying pan (preferably
  with a non-stick surface) over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of
  the oil; swirl to coat surface. Add fish (skin side up if using
  fillets); cover and cook until golden brown on bottom, about 3
  minutes.  carefully turn fish over and repeat to brown other side.
  Remove fish and set aside.
  
  Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add ginger and cook,
  stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add shrimp and stir until
  shrimp are opaque and separated, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms, broth
  and soy sauce and cook for 30 seconds. Add cornstarch solution and
  stir until sauce boils and thickens. Return fish to pan and spoon
  sauce over fish. Cover and simmer until center of fish at thickest is
  just opaque, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer fish to platter; pour
  sauce over fish. Garnish with green onions. Serves 4.

 Categories: Poultry, Game, Casseroles, Jw
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Duck breasts; whole, with
           -ribs and backs
      4    Bacon strips
      1 cl Garlic; finely minced
      1 ts Dried parsley
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
    1/2 ts Marjoram
           Salt
           Freshly ground coarse
           -Black pepper
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 c  Onion; coarsely chopped
     10 oz Can mushrooms and juice
    1/2 c  Sven's Glogg*
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
 
  * A spiced wine, which see, or sub red wine that has had a pinch each
  orange peel, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and anise steeped in it.
  
  Pre-heat oven to 400. Place the skinned breasts in a casserole. Lay 2
  half strips of bacon over each breast. Sprinkle the seasonings over
  the birds and then the onions and mushrooms. Pour the mushroom juice,
  wine and a little stock over all and cover the casserole. Bake for 20
  minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 and bake for a further 55
  minutes.
  
  This dish tastes even better if it is allowed to cool slowly with the
  breasts marinading in the stock and re-heated the next day for
  serving.
  
  Alternatively the cold cooked breasts can be boned; the stock
  thickened with cornstarch or flour and the breast medallions heated
  briefly in the simmering gravy and served on toast.

 Categories: Breads, Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Unprocessed coarse bran
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Sugar (or more to taste)
      2 tb Baking powder
      2 ts Salt
 
  Whisk all ingredients together in lge. bowl--mix thoroughly. Measure
  2 cups into each of 2 plastic bags. Divide any remaining mix equally.
  
  This mix does not produce a sweet cake-like muffin. Rather full
  bodied and textured.  This produces nice contrast when heaped with
  orange marmalade.
  
  However, feel free to adjust sugar to taste.  These recipes are meant
  to serve only as guidelines.  Tinker with them to your hearts'
  delight. They are all "cook-friendly", for the exception of any yeast
  raised mixes, which must be handled like one would approach a prima
  donna: with respect. Yeast breads are quite tempermental.

      Title: BRANDIED FRUIT CAKES (SHARON)
 Categories: Cakes, Fruit, Holidays, Christmas, Brandy
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  4 1/2 c  Raisins
  2 1/4 c  Currants
    1/2 lb Soft butter or margarine
    1/2 lb Soft shortening
      2 c  Sugar
      1 tb Vanilla extract
      1 tb Almond extract
     12    Eggs
      1 c  Orange juice concentrate
           (not thawed)
    1/2 c  Honey
  4 1/2 c  Unsifted all purpose flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Cloves (ground)
      1 c  Pitted dates, cut up
  2 1/4 c  Candied cherries
      1 c  Blanched almonds, halved
 
  **NOTE**  I take the whole amount of fruit (10 cups) and make a nice
  looking mixture.  I don't necessarily use the amounts shown. If the
  candied fruit is on sale, I just use more of it than the raisins. I
  still end up with the 10 cups, but it is usually more of the fruit
  mix and candied pineapple.  The almonds I use are the slivered ones.
  Easier to work with... The original recipe called for brandy or grape
  juice, but I found that if you substitute the orange juice
  concentrate, it has a nicer flavour.
  
  Use 2 tube pans 10x4 each, or 5 loaf pans.  Line pans with 2-3
  thicknesses of brown paper or 1 thickness of heavy foil; grease well
  with unsalted shortening. (I use lard to grease and don't need to
  line with paper)
  
  Wash raisins and currants and dry thoroughly between paper towels.
  Beat butter and shorteningtogether very thoroughly; when smooth and
  fluffy, add sugar gradually, beating continuously. Blend in vanilla
  and almond extract. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each
  addition. Beat in orange juice and honey. This may cause the batter
  to appear separated, but it will not affect results.  Sift together
  remaining dry ingredients. Mix prepared fruits and almonds in large
  mixing bowl; add sifted dry ingredients, and mix well to coat pieces.
  Scrape egg and butter mixture into bowl, and, using hands, combine
  very thoroughly. Fill each pan 3/4 full. Preheat oven to 275F.  Bake
  cakes 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 hours, depending on size of pans used. After
  first hour or so, place pan of water on bottom of oven to prevent
  cakes from drying out. When cakes test done, remove from oven, and
  let pans stand on racks until cakes are completely cooled. Remove
  from pans, and peel of paper linings. Let ripen 4-5 weeks before
  serving. This recipe makes dark moist cake, rich with fruits and
  mingled flavors of spices, honey, and the like. If desired, recipe
  may be halved with good results.
  
  When they come out of the oven, I let them sit for a few minutes and
  then take them out of the pans while still fairly hot. Let them cool
  for maybe 15-20 minutes and then pack them while still warm. I pour
  1/4 to 1/2 cup brandy (apricot, orange, or cherry) onto the cakes,
  wrap in double thickness of Handy wrap, then wrap in tin foil
  securely. I then store them in the basement where it is cool and
  every couple of days I turn them to make sure that the brandy
  diffuses throughout the whole cake. I have NEVER had this recipe fail
  me. I am asked for it by most of my family members as I send them for
  presents at Christmas. I have tried other recipes, but this one has
  the moistest results I have found. By pouring the brandy on AFTER it
  is cooked, you get a cake that kicks!! (for our A.A. friends, I make
  "dry" ones with no brandy and it still stays moist.)

  [Literally: Brown Beans]
  
  From grandmother's more thrifty times; rarely encountered today.
  
  In a wide saucepan, melt the fat, and then slowly stir in the flour,
  until you have a dark brown roux.  Add enough water or meat broth to
  obtain a thick gravy. Add salt, the onion with the two cloves, the
  bay leaf, and sugar, and slowly simmer for about 20 minutes.
  Meanwhile cook the green beans in salted water until al dente. Drain
  water. Stir green beans into gravy and let steep for a few minutes
  before serving.
  
  'Dampfnudeln' (yeast dumplings) are often served with this dish.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: BRAZIL & BULGAR WHEAT BURGERS
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive Oil
      2    Onions
      2    Celery Sticks
      2    Garlic cloves
    125 g  Bulgar Wheat
    250 g  Brazil Nuts
    300 ml Vegetable stock
      2 tb Tomato puree
      2 tb Parsley (chopped)
      2 ts Dried mixed herbs
      1    Egg (beaten
 
  In a food processor chop finely the onion, garlic and celery.
  Seperatly chop nuts and set aside.
  
  Heat oil and add the onion, garlic and celery - saute until soft. Add
  the nuts and Bulgar wheat and saute for a couple of minutes until
  golden brown. Add the stock and simmer until the liquid is absorbed.
  
  Stir in tomato puree, parsley, herbs and the egg. Season with salt and
  pepper and leave until cool enough to handle.
  
  Shape into 'burgers' and either cook in oven at 400F/200C/Gas 6 for
  15 to 20 minutes until heated through or cook in frying pan. Place in
  burger buns with your favorite garnishes - I like cooked onion rings,
  lettuce, cheese and fresh tomato.
  
  If you have problems with the burgers falling apart when cooking try
  adding some grated cheese before shaping - this helps.
  
  An alternate serving suggestion is like a falafal. Take tablespoon
  sized amounts of mixture and fry in some oil until gold to dark
  brown. Put inside lightly warmed Pita bread with some salad and
  Chilli sauce.
  
  You can substitute your favorite nuts for the Brazils.

      Title: BRAZILIAN CHICKEN RICE SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Low-cal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    3 lb. Chicken
      1    Bay leaf
      1    Medium onion, quartered
      1    Whole clove
      2    Ripe tomatoes, quartered
      1    Carrot, cut into 1" pieces
    1/4 c  Chopped celery leaves
     20    Black peppercorns, tied in
           A piece of cheesecloth
    1/2 c  Uncooked white rice
           Salt & freshly ground black
           Pepper
      3    Carrots, thinly sliced on
           The diagonal
    1/4 c  Finely chopped flat-leaf
           Parsley
 
  1.  Wash the chicken thoroughly.  Remove the skin and any pieces of
  fat.
      Pin the bay leaf to 1 onion quarter with the clove. Place the
      chicken in a large pot with the tomatoes, onion quarters, 1
  carrot,
      celery leaves, and peppercorn bundle.  Add 10 cups cold water and
      bring to a boil.  Using a ladle, skim off the fat and foam that
  rise
      to the surface.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour, skimming
  often
      to remove the fat. 2. Remove the chicken from the broth and let
  cool. Strain the broth into
      a large saucepan, pressing the vegetables to extract the juices.
      (There should be about 8 cups of broth.)  Pull the chicken meat
  off
      the bones and shred or finely dice it. 3. Add the rice, salt, and
  pepper to the broth and simmer for 10 minutes.
      Add the thinly sliced carrots and celery to the soup with the
  shredded
      chicken and half the parsley.  Simmer the soup for another 10
  minutes,
      or until the rice is tender.  Correct the seasoning, adding salt
  and
      pepper to taste.  Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve at
      once. ~--

 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------CASHEW NUT CRUST---------------------------
    1/2 c  Unsalted cashews
      2 c  Vanilla wafer cookie crumbs
      4 tb Unsalted butter, melted

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
     11    Ripe passion fruits
      2 tb Water
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ts Unflavored powdered gelatin
      8 oz Cream cheese, softened
      1 cn (14-oz) sweetened condensed
           -milk
      1 ts Lemon juice
      1 c  Heavy cream

MMMMM-------------------PASSION FRUIT TOPPING------------------------
      3 tb Water, divided
      1 ts Unflavored powdered gelatin
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      1    Ripe passion fruit
 
  Make the cashew nut crust: 1.Position a rack in the center of the
  oven and preheat to 350 F. Remove the bottom from an 8 1/2-by-3-inch
  springform pan. Trim a 9-inch cardboard cake circle so that it fits
  snugly within the curved lip of the bottom of the springform pan.
  Cover the bottom with a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, leaving a
  2-inch overhang all around the edge. Carefully attach the side of the
  pan so you do not tear the foil.
  
  2.In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the
  cashews, pulsing the machine on and off, until finely ground.
  Transfer the ground cashews to a medium bowl; stir in the cookie
  crumbs and melted butter until combined. Press the mixture evenly
  onto the bottom and up the side of the prepared pan. Bake the crust
  for 12 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool the crust on a wire rack.
  
  Make the filling: 1.Using a serrated knife, cut the passion fruits in
  half. Scrape the seeded orange pulp of the fruits into the bowl of a
  food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Process the pulp
  for 15 to 20 seconds. Pass the passion fruit puree through a fine
  sieve into a small bowl. Remove 1/4 cup of the puree to a small cup,
  cover and set aside for the passion fruit topping.
  
  2.Place the water and vanilla in a small heatproof cup; sprinkle the
  gelatin over the mixture and allow it to soften for 5 minutes . Place
  the cup with the softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough water to
  come halfway up the side of the cup. Heat the gelatin mixture over
  hot, not simmering, water. Stir the gelatin frequently for 3 to 4
  minutes, or until the gelatin granules dissolve completely and the
  mixture is clear. Remove the pan from the heat.
  
  3.In a medium bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer, beat the cream
  cheese for 30 seconds, until smooth. Add the condensed milk and the
  reserved passion fruit puree and beat the mixture for an additional
  minute, scraping the bottom of the bowl as necessary. Whisk in the
  lemon juice and the warm gelatin mixture.
  
  4.In a chilled, medium bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the
  cream until soft peaks start to form. Do not overheat. Fold one-third
  of the cream into the passion fruit mixture to lighten it. Fold in the
  remaining whipped cream.
  
  5.Scrape the filling into the cooled crust. Refrigerate the cake for 3
  hours, until the filling is firmly set.
  
  Make the passion fruit topping: 1.Place 2 tablespoons of the water in
  a small cup. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water; allow the mixture
  to soften for 5 minutes.
  
  2.In a small saucepan, combine the remaining tablespoon water, the
  reserved passion fruit puree, and the sugar. Cut the remaining
  passion fruit in half and scrape the orange seeded pulp into the pan.
  Cook the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the
  sugar is dissolved. Add the softened gelatin mixture and cook the
  mixture for 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the gelatin is
  dissolved. Remove the mixture from the heat and cool for 10 minutes.
  
  3.Pour the cooled passion fruit topping over the top of the chilled
  cake, tilting the cake to cover the top evenly. Refrigerate the cake
  for 1 hour, until the topping is set.
  
  4.Remove the side of the springform pan and transfer the cake to a
  serving platter. Cut the cake with a sharp, thin-bladed knife,
  dipping the blade in hot water and wiping it dry after each slice.

      Title: BRAZILLIAN BLACK BEAN & RED PEPPER SALAD <T
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    To 3 cups of regular dried
           Black beans
      1 lg Red pepper, diced
      1 lg Green pepper, diced
      2    To 3 finely chopped carrots
      2    To 3 cloves of garlic
    1/2 c  Finely chopped fresh
           Cilantro or fresh parsley
    1/2 c  Rice wine vinegar
      3 tb Water
      1 tb Ground cumin (more if
           Desired)
        x  Dash of hot red pepper
           Flakes
        x  Dash of salt (if desired)
 
  Pick through beans and soak overnight with plenty of water tocover.
  In the morning, drain the beans and add fresh water to cover.
  
  Place beans over heat.  Add one clove of garlic and bring to a
  moderate boil.  Cook beans for approximately 30-45 minutes until
  beans are tender but NOT SOFT and mushy. The beans should be firm
  enough to hold their shape.  Keep a close eye on their progress.
  
  When beans are cooked to the tender stage, remove garlic and drain.
  Place warm beans in a large serving bowl.
  
  While beans are cooking, chop and dice the red and green peppers and
  carrots.  Add them to the beans.  In a 2-cup measuring cup (or
  something similiar),combine the rice wine vinegar, water, cumin and
  other ingredients.  Mince the remaining garlic and add it to the rice
  vinegar dressing. Stir well to combine ingredients.
  
  Toss the bean and vegetable mixture withtherice wine vinegar dressing.
  Cover and refrigerate for a few hours before serving. I think
  tossintg warm beans with dressing enhances the flavors more than if
  using cold beans.
  
  The rice wine vinegar is fairly sweet and very mild. It makes an
  exceptionally delicious replacement for olive oil in just about any
  salad dressing recipe. The lemon-y cilantro adds a wonderful flavor;
  especially when combined with the cumin.  Try to use fresh cilantro.
  Dired cilantro just does not have the same impact. You can substitute
  fresh parsley if desired.
  
  Serve the bean salad over rice and spoon a little dressing over it.
  The red and green peppers add beautiful color and contrast nicely
  with the black beans and cilantrol.  Together it makes for an
  attractive presentation on the plate.
  
  Enjoy.  I really get a lot of very useful information from this list.
  I especially lovetrying the recipes.

  third of the sugar, third of the spices 5. Add a layer of bread 6.
  Repear numbers 3, 4 and 5. 7. Whisk up eggs and milk and cream 8.
  Pour over the bread, enough to not quite cover all the bread 9. Let
  it stand for half an hour to an hour to soak 10. Sprinkle some sugar
  on the top as this will caramelise in the oven and give a crunchy
  topping 11. Put in a medium oven for about an hour
  
  Alternatively, you can add a wee bit of vanilla essence to the milk,
  or heat the milk with a vanilla pod.

      2 c  Sourdough batter; proofed
      1 c  Milk
      3 lg Eggs
      6 c  Flour, all-purpose
      2 tb Baking powder
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      6    Toast slices; cut in cubes
 
  Recipe by: Randy Pollak In a very large mixing bowl combine flour,
  baking powder, salt and toast cubes; mix well. In a medium bowl beat
  eggs slightly; add sourdough batter and milk. Stir until well
  combined. Pour batter mixture into flour mixture and mix dough until
  smooth. Divide dough into four equal pieces and shape each piece into
  small rectangular loaves. Set on wax paper, cover with plastic wrap
  and then a dish towel. Allow dough to rest for at least 1 hour.
  Prepare a large Dutch oven by placing a vegetable steamer inside and
  add water until it comes to just below the steamer. Cover and bring
  to boil. Reduce heat but it must be high enough to create steam.
  Place 1 or 2 (depending on size as loaves will better than double in
  size) loaves unto steamer and for about 20 minutes or until a
  toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean. Four loaves
  is enough for about 12-16 servings. Note: Dumplings may also be
  boiled, in which case you must cut each loaf in half; however
  steaming produces larger and lighter dumplings. If you wish you may
  refrigerate dumplings until cold carefully slice and wrap in plastic
  wrap then foil and freeze.

           -LINDA CALDWELL  KKPD13B
 
  Try substituting unsweetened applesauce for the fats called for in
  your bread recipes. This even works with chocolate cake! Many can't
  tell any difference in taste and the pectin in the applesauce keeps
  the bread moist longer. I buy the small Motts individual containers
  so I don't have a large jar going bad in the fridge. I've read that
  you can use up to one tablespoon of applesauce per cup of flour. If
  you do make this substitution hold out about 1/8 to 1/4 cup of the
  liquid in the recipe and add it back in a tsp. at a time during the
  kneading cycle.

  other breadmaker cornmeal breads but none have equaled this one.

           Hints/tips follows
 
  *Make clean-up easy by spraying the kneading paddle of your machine
  with nonstick spray coating before adding ingredients and by soaking
  the paddle and pan in hot soapy water immediately after removing the
  baked bread.
  
  *Use the end of the handle of a wooden spoon to remove the kneading
  paddle from the hot loaf of bread.
  
  *When rolling out dough mixed in a machine, stop and let the bread
  rest about 5 minutes; then finish rolling it out. The dough is very
  elastic and letting it rest makes it easier to shape.
  
  *To store baked bread, cool it completely; it will take several
  hours. Wrap it in foil or plastic wrap, or place it in a plastic bag.
  Store it in a cool, dry place up to 3 days. To freeze yeast bread,
  place bread in a freezer bag or container, or tightly wrap it in
  heavy foil. Freeze it up to 3 months. Bread can be thawed in the
  package for 1 hour or wrapped in foil and reheated in a 300* oven
  about 20 minutes. From: Bread Machine Bounty-Better Homes and Garden

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  :          Directions Only
  
  Bread Machine Tips
  
  1.Use good quality hard wheat unbleached, unbromated flour that has at
  least 12 grams of protein per cup. (I like King Arthur) 2.Use fresh,
  quick dissolving active yeast, not rapid rise. 3.Open the machine and
  check the dough during the first 5 - 10 minutes of the first kneading
  cycle!!! Even if your manual says not to do it: flour acts as a
  sponge absorbing moisture on wet days and becoming dehydrated during
  dry weather. You'll have to adjust for fluctuating humidity and
  barometric pressure by adding small amounts of flour or liquid to the
  dough. 4.If you've never made bread before and don't know what dough
  is supposed to look like, buy a package of frozen bread dough
  (available at your local supermarket), and let it defrost according
  to the package directions. Place it on a lightly floured surface and
  play with it until you are familiar with the consistency. This is
  what you're aiming for in the bread machine. 5.Now, to adjust the
  dough in your bread machine during the first knead cycle: wait until
  the ingredients have been kneaded for 3-4 minutes. If the dough looks
  sticky and wet and is coating the bottom and sides of the pan, then
  sprinkle in flour, a tablespoon at a time (you may need up to an
  extra 1/2 cup) while the machine is kneading, until you have a
  smooth, supple ball of dough. If the mixture is dry and corrugated
  looking or the dough doesn't hold together then sprinkle in
  additional liquid, a little at a time, until the dough is smooth and
  pliable and forms a cohesive ball. If you've wandered away from your
  machine only to return to find a wet messy glob or a dry desert
  thumping around in the machine, press stop (you can do this at any
  time - except if the machine has gone into the bake cycle), add a
  small amount of flour or liquid and press start. Stick around and
  make additional adjustments, if necessary, until the dough looks
  right. 6.I have found that when you are either making dough, or
  placing the ingredients in the machine to make bread at that time,
  you can add either the liquids first or the dry ingredients first.
  The major exception to this is the old dak (no longer made) where the
  yeast must be placed in the bread pan first in a position farthest
  away from the kneading blade. When programming ahead make sure to
  place any dried fruits away from contact with wet ingredients as they
  will absorb those liquids and throw off the recipe.
  
  Extra kneads and extra rise times all contribute to the depth of
  flavor, character of the crumb and general personality of a loaf of
  bread. One of the reasons I dislike rapid rise yeast and rapid cycles
  on the bread machines is that the dough really requires the entire
  life span of the yeast to become the amazing miracle that is bread.
  If you are partial to whole grain breads and are winding up with
  lower loaves than you wish, then try a double knead cycle: place the
  ingredients in the machine and program for dough or manual. At the
  end of the final knead reprogram the machine for bread (of Whole
  Wheat) and press start. You've given the dough an extra work-out to
  develop the gluten - that will result in a higher loaf. For an even
  higher loaf you can (if your machine permits) program for a longer
  rise time, or simply remove the dough from the pan after the final
  rise cycle (but before baking) transfer it to a bread pan and allow
  it to raise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Then bake it in
  the oven.
  
  Sweet doughs with lots of butter and eggs also respond well to a
  second long rise in a cool place. I remove my brioche from the
  machine after the dough cycle is complete. I place it in a large
  freezer strength zip lock bag and refrigerate it overnight. Then I
  place it back in the machine (my Zojirushi has flexible programming),
  program for 2nd rise and bake. If you can't program your machine this
  way you can place the dough in a bread pan after you remove it from
  the machine, give it a long, refrigerated rise, and then bake it in
  the oven. Even non-wheat and non-sweet doughs can benefit from this
  extra rise.

      Title: BREAD MAKING ( LESSON FOUR OF FOUR)
 Categories: Bread
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           (In Which We Get a Little
           Fancy)
 
  First, let's review the basic recipe for one loaf of "plain" white
  bread --
  
        3 c  all-purpose flour 1 pkg yeast 1 1/4 c liquid (water or
  milk...milk recommended) 1 egg (optional but recommended) An egg can
  be added for extra flavor and nutrition; it softens the crust and
  gives the interior a finer crumb. 1 teaspoon salt (optional but
  recommended) 1 tablespoon sugar (optional but recommended)
  
  Mix about three minutes until dough does not stick to floured fingers.
  Knead for no less than 10 minutes; cover with towel and let it rise
  in a warm (75 - 80 F) place for about an hour, or until it has about
  doubled in size; punch it down; let it rest about 15 minutes; place
  in greased bread pan; cover; let it rise about another hour; bake at
  400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until it sounds "hollow" when
  thumped; remove from pan; let cool.
  
  To make 2 loaves, simply double everything EXCEPT the yeast.
  
  Now, for a couple of variations on a theme:
  
  Rye bread -- instead of 3 cups of all-purpose flour, use 2 cups of
  all- purpose and 1 cup of rye flour (available at a health food
  store)...add 2 tablespoons of caraway seed to the dough...use
  buttermilk instead of plain milk or water...add 1/3 cup of light
  molasses to the dough...omit the sugar...the egg is still
  optional...instead of baking in a bread pan, shape into a round ball
  and bake on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Reduce the baking
  temperature to 350 degrees...baking time may be 5 - 10 minutes
  longer...(One loaf).
  
  Whole wheat bread -- increase sugar to 1 1/2 tablespoons...use 1 1/2
  cups of all-purpose flour and 2 cups of whole-wheat flour...use milk
  instead of water...add 1/4 cup of butter or margarine...add 1/2 cup
  molasses...the egg is still optional.  The method is the same except
  the baking time may be 5 - 10 minutes longer.
  
  For the above two variations, do NOT be tempted to use ALL rye flour
  or ALL whole-wheat flour.  Those flours do not have enough gluten in
  them for proper rising action, so you MUST use some all-purpose
  flour, otherwise your finished product will be very heavy and close
  textured.
  
  For high-altitude baking (above 5,000 feet), use 1/2 the yeast. Yeast
  dough rises faster at high altitudes.
  
  A "perfect" loaf of bread should:
  
  o  Have a well-browned, evenly rounded top o Have a soft and moist
  interior, easily pulled apart o Have a uniform color o Have an even
  texture -- holes are small and uniform in size from top to bottom
  
  To keep bread fresh, wrap each cooled loaf in foil or plastic wrap,
  or seal in a plastic bag; store in a cool, dry cupboard or bread box.
  Bread may be stored in the refrigerator but it goes stale more
  quickly.
  
  Bread keeps in the freezer for up to 3 months if tightly wrapped in
  foil, heavy-duty plastic wrap, or freezer wrap, or sealed in plastic
  bags. Always make sure to press out as much air as possible.
  
  Well, that's about it, li'l buckaroos.  Don't be afraid to experiment
  ~ Add raisins, nuts, cheese, finely diced and lightly sauteed onions,
  or anything else you can think of to the dough.  Add green food
  coloring for St. Patrick's day!  Add a squid or two...play around
  with using different liquids...a friend of mine recently told me she
  was baking a cake and ran out of milk, so she substituted baby
  formula...said it was the best cake she'd ever made! Play around with
  different shapes...knots, pinwheels, crescents, rolls, etc.  Use your
  imagination! Make a heart-shaped loaf of bread for Valentine's day or
  a birthday! Tell us about your successes, give your not-so-valiant.

           Bread Making (without a
           Net)
 
  This is a Public Service Post brought to you from the Bourbon Cowboy
  re: "Bread Making"...
  
  Anyone who owns a Bread Making Machine, please skip this message...
  
  A lot of folks think that making bread "from scratch" is a lost,
  arcane art, practised by li'l old ladies in pink pinafores. Well,
  this ol' cowpoke is here to tell ya' that ANYONE can make bread, from
  "scratch"...and it's not all that difficult.  Time consuming,
  perhaps, but bear with me, and let's see what happens...
  
  First off, let me give y'all a little Bread History...

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Bread lesson 3
 
  Hello once again, all you li'l ol' bread-makers! Ready for lesson
  three?
  
  First, let's review the basic recipe:
  
  3 cups all-purpose flour 1 package yeast
    1 1/4    cups water
  
  Mix, knead, let rise, punch down, let rise, bake.
  
  Hopefully you've tried a couple of loaves of this and are fairly
  comfortable with the technique.  Now, try this:
  
  To the basic recipe, add one teaspoon of salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons of
  sugar, 1 egg, and substitute milk for water. After the second rise,
  just before you pop it in the oven, sprinkle some dill seed or sesame
  seed on top.
  
  An important note here is do NOT "guesstimate" the sugar and/or salt.
  You can get away with this when making chili or squid, but NOT when
  baking.
  
  Now it's starting to look and taste a little more like bread.
  
  Note that home-made bread will NOT "keep" for longer than a day or so
  before it becomes hard as a rock. This is normal, and is why our
  forefathers had recipes for such neat stuff as bread pudding, bread
  crumbs, etc.
  
  It's also interesting to note that the basic recipe makes a KILLER
  pizza dough, if you're into home-made pizza. I'll leave the add-ons
  as an exercise for the student, as no two people can ever agree on
  what makes a good pizza filling.
  
  You shouldn't have had any problems so far, but here's a
  troubleshooting chart for ya':

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/3 c  Raisins
    2/3 c  Bourbon (approx.)
     11 oz French bread loaf
      6 c  Milk
      5    Eggs
      2 c  Sugar
      6 tb Unsalted butter
      2 ts Vanilla
           Sauce:
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
      1 c  Sugar
      2    Eggs
    1/3 c  Bourbon
 
  Recipe by: BENJAMIN STRONG (WWGQ25B) This is a classic New Orleans
  dessert and a favorite of many. There are numerous versions - almost
  every good Creole cook has her own. My wife developed this one after
  many years of experimenting. I do NOT think that you will be
  disappointed! This recipe will serve ten to twelve people - with
  seconds.
  
  Cover the raisins with the bourbon and let them soak overnight. Cube
  the bread in about 5/8 inch cubes. You will need 8 to 9 cups. In a
  large bowl combine bread and milk and let stand at room temperature
  until bread is very soft. In another bowl beat 5 eggs and 2 cups
  sugar and 3 Tbsp. melted butter. Stir this into the bread mixture.
  Drain raisins, reserving bourbon for sauce. Add raisins and vanilla
  to the bread mixture and stir well until mixed. Melt remaining 3
  Tbsp. butter in a 9" x13" pan. Pour the pudding into the pan. Bake in
  a 350 degree oven until puffed and golden brown. This should take
  about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  For the sauce, cream 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup sugar. Beat in 2 eggs,
  one at a time. Transfer to the top of a double boiler set over
  simmering water. Stir in about 1/3 cup bourbon whiskey and additional
  if required. You might want to experiment with the amount. Cook the
  sauce, stirring, until it is thickened slightly. Serve warm sauce
  over warm bread pudding. Note - we have found both pudding and sauce
  can be frozen.
  
  Adjust bourbon, which should be a very good straight bourbon, to your
  taste. We use LOTS! Jack Daniels is NOT a bourbon and, IMHO, is not a
  good choice. We use Fitzgerald.JM.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Sweet bread, cubed, oven dri
    1/2 lb Raisins
      1 ts Cinnamon
      8 oz Sugar
      8 ea Eggs
      3 oz Melted butter
    1/2 lb Coconut, shredded
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
      1 tb Vanilla
      1 qt Milk, hot
 
    The bread is important in this recipe.  We use the breakfast
  pastries croissants here, but you can use any bread that is not
  pre-sliced. The one I would recommend is an egg yellow color inside.
  Cut it into large cubes, toast in oven in single layer til they're
  like croutons. Place them in the pan you will be baking in. It should
  be 2/3rds full. Add the raisins and coconut & toss.  Drizzle top of
  all with the melted butter. Whip eggs till beaten, gradually add the
  hot milk, then add sugar and spices and vanilla. Pour over bread
  mixture and place in a water bath ( a larger pan than the pudding
  pan- water filled 1/2 way up the outer rim of bread pudding pan).
  Bake in 375 oven for 45 minutes to an hour. You should feel the
  center of the pudding to be sure it is set. You can serve warm with
  whipped cream or chilled as you prefer. Makes one pan, 8 X 10-inches

      Title: BREAD PUDDING WITH WHISKEY SAUCE-BON TON CAFE
 Categories: Puddings, Cajun
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------BREAD PUDDING----------------------------
      1    Loaf French bread
      1    Quart milk
      3    Eggs
      2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Vanilla extract
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 c  Raisins
      3 tb Melted margarine

MMMMM-----------------------WHISKEY SAUCE----------------------------
      1 c  Sugar
      1    Stick butter
           -(or margarine)
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 oz Bourbon whiskey or
           -Southern Comfort;
           -rum also works well
 
  This is the classic New Orleans bread pudding, as prepared at the Bon
  Ton Cafe on Magazine Street. I consider it a quintessential version,
  but there are many possible variations: you can enrich it by using
  half-and-half instead of milk, and an extra egg; you can add
  different fruits, nuts, etc.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Tear bread into chunks and soak in milk.
  Crush with hands to make sure milk has soaked through. Add eggs,
  sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, raisins and stir well. Pour melted
  margarine or butter in bottom of a heavy 9 x 14 baking pan. Add bread
  mixture (and I sprinkle more cinnamon and raisins on top) and bake
  until very firm, about 40 mins. Cool pudding, cube it and put it into
  individual dessert dishes. When ready to serve, add whiskey sauce and
  heat under broiler for a few minutes (last step optional).
  
  Whiskey sauce
  
  A variation that I like is to use Southern Comfort for the sauce
  instead of whiskey. Cream sugar and butter and cook in a
  double-boiler until very hot and well-dissolved. Add well-beaten egg
  very slowly and whip very fast so egg doesn't curdle. Cool and add
  liquor. Walt MM

    1/2 c  Rainins
      1 c  Brandy
     10 sl Whole wheat bread (or more)
    1/2 c  Pecans, toasted & chopped
      1 c  Grated cheddar cheese
      1 c  Sugar
  3 1/2 c  Water, hot
      3 tb Unsalted butter

        ds Nutmeg
        ds Ground corriander
        ds Cloves

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      1 c  Whipping cream
    1/4 c  Powdered sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
     The day before, put raisins into a small bowl and pour brandy over
  them. Cover loosely and let stand overnight. Next day, preheat oven
  to 350 F. Butter a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Dice bread and put it in
  dish. Add pecans and cheese to the bread and toss. Scatter the
  raisins over the top, drizzling on any brandy that has not been
  soaked up by raisins. Pour the sugar into a large heavy saucepan.
  Warm it over medium heat, stirring to facilitate even heating, until
  it melts and turns a deep golden brown. Pour in the water, carefully
  because steam will rise rapidly as water hits the sugar.  The mixture
  will begin to solidify.
  
     Stirring, cook until the mixture is liquid again. Add butter,
  vanilla, and spices to syrup.  Ladle the caramel carefully over
  bread. Syrup should be about level with tops of the bread. If any
  bread pcs. are not covered, push them down into the liquid.
  
     Bake 20 to 25 min. until syrup is absorbed and cheese has melted
  into the pudding.
  
     Beat whipping cream, adding sugar and vanilla. Spoon pudding into
  serving dishes, and dollop whipped cream on top.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 c  Flour
      1 pk Dry yeast
    1/2 c  Milk
      3 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      3 tb Butter or margarine
 
  Heat the milk 3 tbsp butter and 1.5 cups water to about 130 degrees.
  Add this to 2 cups of flour and the rest of the dry ingredients and
  beat for about 2 minutes at medium speed till you have a batter add
  aprox 3 cups of flour beating with a large spoon until you have a
  soft dough adding aditional flour as needed.
    Knead this on a lightly flowered surface for about 10 minutes until
  the dough is smooth and elastic. form this into a ball and let rise
  in a lightly greased bowl for 1 hour or until doubled.
    When doubled punch down and push edges into middle then cut in half
  cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Form into loaves and place in
  lightly greased pan to again double. Preheat oven to 400 degrees then
  bake for about 25 to 30 minutes.
    This makes a nice tasty bread but I would like it to be not as
  dense. Where do I start: 1. more or less kneading? 2. use less flour?
  3. more

           Pizza dough of choice
    1/2    Stick margerine
           Garlic powder
           Parmesean Cheese
 
  After making the dough for your pizza you place it on a piece of
  heavy duty aluminium foil. Spread it into a circular pizza shape.
  Take your pizza cutter and score the dough into 1/2" slices and then
  cut the entire pie in half.  Melt a 1/2 stick of margerine and add
  1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder(add more or less to suit you). Spread
  this on your bread sticks. Top the bread with parmesean cheese and
  place aluminum foil directly on oven rack-no pan needed-at 450
  degrees until crispy and browned. I always make an extra crust when
  making pizza for my family. After eating the bread sticks no one
  wants much pizza. I hope you like it. Mary in Memphis

  Serve slices of this nutty sweet breat for breakfast, brunch, or an

  BREAD DIRECTIONS: Add flour, milk, the nuts, egg, sugar, margarine or
  butter, liqueur, yeast, and salt to the bread machine according to the
  manufacturer's directions. Bake and cool as directed. When brread is
  cool, drizzle with Amaretto Glaze.
  
  AMARETTO GLAZE: In a small mixing bowl combine sugar, amaretto or
  hanelnut liqueur *OR* almond extract.  If needed, add 1 to 2
  teaspoons milk to make of drizzling consistency.
  
  BREAD MACHINE BASICS: These helpful tips apply to all types of bread
  machines: Bread flour, which is high in protein, works best for
  breads made in a bread machine. You can use other grains or flours
  with the bread flour but not in place of all of it.  Some recipes
  also call for a small amount of gluten flour. This helps breads,
  especially those made with low-gluten flours (such as whole wheat
  flour), hold together.
  
  Add ingredients to the bread machine in the order specified by the
  directions in the owner's manual.
  
  To use powdered milk instead of fresh, add 1/3 cup nonfat dry milk
  powder for each 1 cup of water and add it with the flour. Always use
  powdered milk when using the timer on your machine.

      3 tb Chef's Salt (see below)
      4    Whole eggs
    1/2 c  Milk

MMMMM------------------------CHEF'S SALT-----------------------------
      1 c  Salt
      1    Tb Spanish paprika
      1 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Ground white pepper
    1/4 ts Celery salt
    1/4 ts Garlic salt
 
  Crisp fried chicken is one of the things that I always find
  contradictory instructions for.  "ALWAYS cover the frying chicken."
  "NEVER cover the frying chicken." This is from "The Chef's Secret
  Cook Book" and directly addresses the question.  It works too.  I
  tried this out last night (used a bunch of chicken wings rather than
  whole cut up chickens) and came up with a crispy, nice batch of fried
  chicken.  The trick is explained in the "Chef's Secret" section
  below. BTW, I used plain ol' commercial seasoned salt instead of the
  "Chef's Salt" called for and it turned out just fine.
  
  1.  When cutting the chicken into serving pieces, separate the thighs
  from the drumsticks, cut each breast in half, leaving a part of the
  breast meat on each wing, and, if you wish, cut two separate back
  pieces.
  
  2.  Take out all the small bones like the rib cage, backbone,
  collarbone, etc.,leaving only the main bones in the pieces.
  
  3.  Mix the flour with the Chef's Salt.  Beat the eggs with the 1/2
  cup milk and the water, then strain through a sieve.
  
  4.  Dip each chicken piece in the 2 cups milk, let the milk drip off,
  then dip it in the flour-spice mixture. Be sure to completely cover
  with the flour mixture. Shake off excess flour and then dip in the
  egg wash. Turn the piece to be sure no dry spots remain, then place
  the piece on the top of the piled up bread crumbs, Sprinkle more
  bread crumbs over the chicken until completely covered, then gently
  but firmly press down so that the crumbs really adhere to the
  chicken. Shake off excess crumbs and lay the chicken parts on a paper
  covered tray, skin side up. Continue until all chicken is breaded.
  
  5.  In a large frying pan which has a lid, beat half of the
  shortening to approximately 360F and carefully, one by one, put in
  the chicken pieces, skin side up. Add the chicken slowly so that the
  fat remains hot. Cover the pan, adjust the beat to medium, and cook
  for about 10 to 12 minutes.
  
  6.  Remove cover, turn pieces, and fry, uncovered, for another 10
  minutes or so.  Remove the pieces to a warm place on absorbent paper
  and keep warm until served.
  
  CHEF'S SECRET:  By straining the egg-milk-water mixture, called egg
  wash, you avoid having big parts of the egg white adhere to some
  pieces so that there is not enough of the egg wash for other pieces.
  Also, the straining makes the coating even.
  
  If you want to avoid lumps of flour and bread crumbs on your fingers,
  designate one hand as "wet" and the other as "dry." With the wet hand,
  handle the uncoated chicken, dip it into and remove it from the,
  milk, and place it on the flour.  Sprinkle flour over it with the dry
  hand, and coat it and lift it out with the dry hand. Place it in the
  egg wash with the dry hand, lift it out with the wet hand, and then
  finish with the, dry hand. It sounds complicated, but if you learn
  the trick you can prepare large amounts of chicken without ever
  getting lumps on your fin fingers.
  
  It is important to cover the pan while the bottom of the chicken is
  frying as this keeps it tender.  Frying the pieces without a cover
  after turning makes the skin crisp.
  
  CHEF'S SALT:
  
  Mix well and use instead of salt:
  
  Be careful to use garlic salt, not garlic powder, If you use garlic
  powder a small pinch is enough.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

    3/4 c  Soy sauce
    1/2 c  Whole-wheat pastry or white
           -flour
    1/2 c  Fine cornmeal
           Soy or other vegetable oil
           -for frying
           Dip:
    1/2 lb Soft tofu
           Additional
    1/2 c  Water
           Additional
      2 tb Soy sauce
           Garnishes:
           Tofu Tartar Sauce (recipe
           -follows)
           Fresh parsley
 
  To defrost tofu, place plastic bag filled with frozen tofu into bowl
  of hot water.  After about 15 minutes, drain bowl and ad more hot
  water. Repeat process until tofu is soft. Remove tofu from plastic
  bag, rinse, and then squeeze out excess water by placing cakes
  between two plates and pressing plates together while tipping out
  water. Cut tofu horizontally into
      1/2    inch thick slices. In large shallow pot, combine water,
  ginger, and soy sauce. Simmer sliced tofu in the marinade for 20
  minutes. With large spatula, remove tofu. Gently squeeze out excess
  liquid by pressing tofu between fingertips. Set aside. To make dip,
  combine soft tofu, 1/2 c water, and 2 Tb soy sauce in blender or food
  processor; pour this batter onto large flat plate. Place whole-wheat
  flour in a second flat plate and cornmeal on a third. Dredge each
  slice of marinated tofu first in flour, then in batter, and last in
  cornmeal. Heat oil to sizzling in large skillet and deep or shallow
  fry (as you prefer) each cutlet until both sides are golden brown.
  Drain on paper towels. Serve with dollop of tartar sauce and sprig of
  fresh parsley. Note: to freeze tofu, place in plastic bag, seal, and
  freeze for a minimum of 48 hours before thawing. The color of frozen
  tofu will be a light amber, and when cooked, its texture will be
  pleasantly chewy. Makes 6 servings.

  Breads by Machine - dated 12/20/93 to Ursula R. Taylor.
    You should be able to convert dog biscuit recipes to your bread
  machine. If you have a 1 1/2 lb. machine, use about 1 cup liquid
  (eggs count as a scant 1/4 cup liquid) and a total of 3 cups of dry
  ingredients (flour and grains).  If the mixture is too stiff for your
  machine to mix easily, add 1 to 2 tbsp. more liquid. Hope this helps.

  using this method - use only dough cycle, then remove and roll or pat

     Make sure that all ingredients are at LEAST room temp. Put all
  ingredients in bread pan in order listed. Yeast must be fresh! I keep
  it in the refrigerator, but bringing to room temp. only takes a few
  minutes. If you are making bread other than white, you may need to
  add gluten and/or lecithin to your dough. They are especially helpful
  when making whole wheat, rye or other heavier type breads. They help
  improve elasticity of the dough. (They are usually available at
  Health Food stores and I have found Lethicin near the Vitamins at
  Pharmor.) I usually set the dark/light setting to "11 o'clock" unless
  I'm making sweet bread, then I set it back to about "9 o'clock". The
  key to using the auto-breadmaker is to have the correct proportion of
  flour to liquid. After the dough has kneaded for a few minutes in the
  breadmaker, look in and see if there is ONE ball of dough which is
  incorporating most of the flour from the sides of the pan. If it's a
  "gooey mess", add 1 T. flour until it makes ONE SOFT ball. If there
  are two or more balls, add 1 T water and see if it makes 1 ball. (You
  may have to go back and forth with this until you get it right <G>)
  While it's in its first knead (BEFORE it goes into the fermentation
  cycle), open the lid and touch the dough lightly. It should be in one
  soft ball. If your finger has sticky dough on it, add a Tablespoon of
  flour. Let it knead a minute and touch it again and check to see if
  it's still sticky. Keep adding a tablespoon at a time ONLY until it's
  no longer sticky, DON'T OVERDO IT. If it just makes a slight
  indentation and doesn't look crusty, it's probably about right. If it
  feels too dry or is in two or more DRY-looking balls (not a sticky
  mass), add a tablespoon at a time of WARM water. PLEASE DON'T ADD TOO
  MUCH LIQUID. If you add too much liquid in proportion to the flour,
  the dough may rise too much and overflow. If you look in and see that
  the dough is threatening to rise up over the top of the bread pan,
  don't panic, poke it a few times with a toothpick, skewer, fork,etc.
  until it deflates a little. PLEASE SEE BREADMAKER HINTS #2 Rev for
  continutation of hints. Written in 1991

     I've found that I can use butter, margarine, diet margarine
  (although it does add a little moisture), olive oil, etc. for the
  fat. I add 3 T. buttermilk powder to many of the recipes. I add it on
  top of the flour, but I have heard that many people add it right
  after the yeast. Eggbeaters and dry egg substitutes work fine, too. I
  often add 1/2 cup of sourdough starter to my breads. I have 3
  starters: white sourdough, potato (sweet bread) starter, and whole
  wheat starter. I decrease the water or milk called for in recipes
  when I add a starter.
    Although the DAK takes 3 c flour, you can use more if you are making
  whole wheat or other dark breads because it doesn't rise as much. If
  you are making rye or pumpernickel, your bread will be a smaller,
  denser loaf when baked. If you are adding nuts or raisins to your
  recipe, shake them in a baggie with about 2 tsp. flour BEFORE adding
  them to the dough. The time to add them is towards the END of the
  second cycle when you hear the beeps. Raisins add a little moisture
  to the dough so you'll probably need a tad more flour after adding
  them in order for the dough not to be sticky.
    I know that there are gadgets out now to help with slicing
  Breadmaker Bread, however I still use my trusty electric knife to
  slice it. Since my Breadmaker makes round bread, I slice it in half
  vertically first and then slice each half into slices. After it has
  COMPLETELY cooled, I store it in baggies. The first day, I just leave
  it on the counter. After that, I store it in the refrig. or freezer.

      Title: BREADSTICKS WITH BLACK PEPPER & CHEDDAR
 Categories: Breads, Cheese
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  2 1/2 c  Unbleached flour plus
    1/2 c  (approximately) for kneading
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Active dry yeast
      1 pn Sugar (generous)
  1 1/2 c  ;Warm water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2 ts Coarsely ground black pepper
      3    Scallions; sliced thin
           -- (abt. 1/4 c.)
      1 c  Grated Cheddar cheese
      1    Egg white; lightly beaten
           -- with 1 tsp. water
           Cornmeal
           Kosher salt (opt'l.)
 
  In a mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 c. of the unbleached flour with the
  whole wheat flour and salt.  Make a well in the flour and add yeast,
  sugar and 1/2 c. of the warm water. Let yeast stand until foamy,
  about 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  Stir in another 1/2 c. water and the oil.  Add remaining water and
  stir the batter vigorously with a wooden spoon. Add 1/2 c. flour and
  beat well. Stir in the pepper, scallions, cheese and another 1/2 c.
  flour; blend well.
  
  Sprinkle about 1/4 c. of the flour for kneading on a pastry board or
  marble and turn the dough out onto it. Knead, adding the rest of the
  flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and homogeneous and
  springs back when pressed with your thumb.  The dough will be
  slightly sticky, but should not be too sticky.  Add a bit more flour
  if necessary.
  
  Cover the dough with a clean, dry tea towel and let it rest 5 to 10
  minutes.  Roll it into a cylinder about 20 to 24" long and cut the
  cylinder into about 20 pieces with a sharp knife. Let the pieces
  rest, covered, for 5 minutes.
  
  Lightly oil two baking sheets and sprinkle them lightly with
  cornmeal. Roll each piece of dough into a cylinder about 10" long and
  3/4" wide, and place ten of them on each baking sheet. If you prefer
  smaller breadsticks, cut each one in half crosswise.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 F. and set the baking sheets, covered with
  clean tea towels, in a warm place to rise. Gas ovens generate a
  warmth while preheating which is just right for raising the dough;
  just turn the baking sheets occasionally to ensure even heat. If you
  have an electric oven, choose a different place for raising. Let the
  sticks rise 25 to 30 minutes, until they have increased in size by
  about 50 percent.
  
  With a sharp knife, make five or six diagonal slashes on top of each
  breadstick.  Brush them lightly with the egg white and water mixture.
  Sprinkle very lightly with salt, if desired.
  
  Bake breadsticks for 20 to 25 minutes (16 to 20 minutes if you've cut
  them in half), changing the position of the baking sheets on the oven
  racks about halfway through baking time. The breadsticks should be
  golden brown.
  
  Eat them right away or let them cool and store them in tightly closed
  tins; wrapped tightly, they can be stored in the freezer for up to a
  month. Wrap them in foil and gently reheat at 300 F. for 10 to 12
  minutes (slightly longer if frozen) before serving.
  
  Yield: Twenty 1 x 12" breadsticks.
  
  Belsinger and Dille write: "More like small baguettes than the
  completely dry commercial breadsticks, these have a crisp crust and a
  chewy, bready interior.  They have a nice, lingering, peppery
  aftertaste that complements most soups and salads, and aperitifs or
  cocktails, and they're excellent party fare."

      Yield: 7 Dozen
 
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
    3/4 c  Light-brown sugar
  1 1/2 tb Finely grated lemon zest
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 lb Whole shelled hazelnuts
           -(about 3/4 C)
    1/2 c  Golden raisins
 
  1. Heat oven to 325'. Lightly oil and flour a large baking sheet or
  line it with parchment paper.
  
  2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, lemon
  zest, baking powder, and salt until well blended.
  
  3. In a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 C water, the eggs, and the
  vanilla and stir into the flour mixture; the dough will be sticky.
  Stir in hazelnuts and raisins.
  
  4. Divide the dough into 3 equal portions. On a heavily floured work
  surface, shape each portion into a log about 13 inches long by 2
  inches wide. Place the logs 2 inches apart on the prepared baking
  sheet. Bake until logs are firm and golden brown on the bottom, about
  45 minutes. Remove logs from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack
  for at least 30 minutes.
  
  5. With a clean serrated knife, cut each log into 1/2-inch-thick
  diagonal slices. Place the slices in a single layer on a clean baking
  sheet (you'll probably need to use 2 baking sheets). Bake until tops
  of biscotti are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Turn biscotti over
  and bake until golden brown and very dry, about 15 minutes more. Cool
  the biscotti completely on a wire rack before serving. Store in an
  air- tight container.

      2 ts Fresh sage leaves
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 425F.  Cover a baking sheet with a piece of
  parchment paper.
  
  2.  Make the biscuits:  sift the flour, baking powder, and salt
  together into a large bowl.  Using two knives or a pastry blender,
  cut in the butter until the texture rangers from cornmeal to the size
  of small peas. (These two steps can be done quickly in a food
  processor.) Using a fork, gradually mix in the yogurt, then the milk,
  until the dough is quite soft and somewhat sticky.  Work quickly
  without overworking the dough. Turn it out onto a lightly floured
  surface and knead it briefly, just long enough to get it to hold
  together. Roll it out so it is about 1 1/4 inches thick, and cut it
  into 2 inch rounds. (You will have 10 biscuits.) Arrange the rounds
  on the prepared baking sheet, and bake in the center of the oven
  until they are deep golden, puffed and cooked through, 18 to
       20    minutes.
  
  3.  While the biscuits are baking, prepare the sausages: place all the
  sausage ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly, using your
  fingers. To test the seasoning, fry a tiny patty and taste; adjust if
  necessary.
  
  4.  Place the patties in a large heavy or nonstick skillet over
  medium-high heat, and cook until they are crisp and brown on the
  outside and cooked through inside, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer
  the sausage patties to a warmed platter and keep warm.
  
  5.  Make the gravy:  Add enough of the butter to the skillet so the
  bottom is covered with 1/8 inch of fat. Stir, scraping up the browned
  bits from the bottom of the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and
  add the flour slowly, stirring until it has absorbed the butter.
  Cook, stirring constantly, until it turns golden brown, at least 2
  minutes. Then slowly pour in the milk, stirring constantly, and cook
  until the gravy thickens to the consistency of very heavy cream.
  Season to taste with salt and a generous amount of black pepper.
  
  6.  To serve, split two biscuits in half.  Place the bottom halves on
  a warm plate, top them with sausage patties, and pour a generous
  amount of gravy over the sausage. Mince the fresh sage and sprinkle
  some over the sausage and gravy.  Set the biscuit tops at an angle,
  partially covering the sausages and serve immediately.
  
  4 servings (with extra biscuits).

      Title: BREAKFAST CLAFOUTIS
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Fruit (prepared weight) 4 to
           -6 oz. blueberries,
           -raspberries, or cranberries
           -or 12 oz. (approx.)
           -cherries, peaches, or plums
           Zest from 1 small lemon,
           -grated
      2 tb Sugar, plus additional to
           -sweeten fruit
    1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      2    Eggs, any size
      1 c  Milk (low-fat, if desired)
      1 tb Unsalted butter
           Confectioners' sugar
           Sour cream (optional)
 
  Preheat the oven to 425.  Wash and prepare the fruit. Cherries should
  be stemmed and, if desired, pitted. Plums or peaches should be pitted
  and cut into bite-sized pieces; commercial cranberries should be cut
  in half; small wild cranberries, blueberries, or raspberries need
  only be picked over to remove stem pieces and debris.
  
  Make lemon sugar by mixing the lemon zest with the 2 tablespoons
  sugar in a small dish.  In a large bowl, sift together the flour and
  salt. In a small bowl, beat the eggs gently and whisk in the milk.
  Add the wet to the dry ingredients a little at a time, whisking
  smooth. Stir in the lemon sugar. Let the batter rest while the fruit
  is being cooked.
  
  In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat,
  coating the bottom and the sides halfway to the rim. When the butter
  is bubbling, add the fruit. Stir until each piece has softened and is
  coated with butter, about 2-3 minutes.  Then sprinkle in sugar to
  sweeten. We use about 2 T of granulated sugar for all fruit except
  cranberries (which require about twice as much) and peaches (where we
  prefer brown sugar). When this sugar has dissolved and turned into a
  syrup--about 2 minutes--stir up the batter and scrape it carefully
  into the pan over the fruit. Put the skillet into the oven to bake
  for about 20 minutes. At this point the clafoutis will be set, golden
  brown, and puffed up at the edges. Divide into warmed bowls, sift a
  little confectioners' sugar over each, and top if you like with a
  spoonful of sour cream.

      Title: BREAKFAST HASH PURPLES
 Categories: Digest, Mar95, Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Purple potatoes
      1 ea Green Onions (amount
           According to taste)
      1 ea Garlic (amount according to
           Taste)
      1 ea Red peppers (amount
           According to taste)
      1 ea Salt
      1 ea Pepper
      1 ea Cayenne pepper powder or
           Paprika (depending on heat
           Desired)
 
  Soak the purple potatoes in a bowl of water for about a half an hour.
  This makes it very easy to scrub the skins, eliminating the need to
  peel them and lose those nutrients. After scrubbing, pat them dry and
  cut them into approximately 3/4" cubes. Be careful where you cut
  them, as they can stain (purple potato juice!). Put them in a mixing
  bowl. Wash, trim, and slice the green onions. Add to potatoes. Finely
  chop the garlic and add to potatoes. Wash and cut up the red peppers
  to taste. I like fairly large hunks of sweet red pepper. Add salt,
  pepper, and pepper powder to taste.
  
  Spray a little bit of pam or other cooking spray in a non-stick
  roasting pan. Bake in a 400-degree oven for approximately 1/2 hour.
  This time will vary with the size and amount of the potato pieces.
  Stir occasionally while baking. I have found that ensuring that they
  lie in a single layer works the best and yields a crispy, not soggy,
  crust on the potatoes.
  
  Sorry about the approximate amounts.  I make this different every
  time. We find that the combination of purple, green, red, and white
  makes a dish that is a visual delight. It's also a low fat
  replacement for those greasy breakfast hash browns.

      Title: BREAKFAST PANCAKES
 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 8 Pancakes
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Sugar
  1 3/4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Vanilla essence
      2    Eggs
      3 tb Butter, melted
     10 oz Milk
 
  Put a frying pan on a low to medium heat and melt the butter. Whilst
  the butter is melting, measure the flour and sift into a large mixing
  bowl. Add the salt, sugar and baking powder.
  
  Measure the milk in a measuring jug.  Separate the eggs and place the
  whites in a cup, adding the yolks to the milk. Add the melted butter
  from the frying pan. Remove as much from the pan as you can, but
  don't be too particular. The remaining butter in the frying pan will
  be used to cook the pancakes in. I use a rubber spatula to get most
  of it off the pan. Leave the ring on, but don't put the pan back on
  it. (I have an electric cooker which takes a long time to heat up).
  In this way you can start cooking the pancakes as soon as the batter
  is ready.
  
  When the butter has coagulated, add the liquid mixture to the dry
  ingredients and mix them up. I use a metal spoon. It is at this stage
  you can judge whether the mixture has the right consistency.
  
  Wash the measuring jug and dry it thoroughly.  Pour the egg whites
  into it and whisk with an electric hand-held whisk. I whisk them
  until they are quite hard. (If there are lumps in the batter, you can
  user the whisk to get rid of them.) Using the spatula (from the
  butter, right?), transfer all the egg whites into the big bowl. Fold
  the egg whites into the batter with the metal spoon until they are
  all incorporated. The batter is now ready.
  
  Put the frying pan back on the heat and wait until it is to a
  reasonable temperature.  I can't be more specific because it depends
  on your cooker and the frying pan that you are using. Make the
  pancakes one at a time, turning them over when the underside is
  cooked. Eat immediately with butter and maple syrup.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Light and fluffy breakfast pancakes -- The formula comes from "The
  Joy of Cooking" by Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Rombauer Becker. I
  bought the book when I was visiting California a few years back. The
  pancakes are to my liking, but my wife has had to endure vast
  quantities of failures before I got the right technique. These
  pancakes are amazing for their stupefying ability. No more than three
  can be eaten in one day. A slow and painful death will result from
  exceeding these guidelines. Yield: 8-10 6-inch pancakes.
  
  *  The order that I do things is the result of much experimentation.
  I have a Creda Cavalier and use a Fissler German-made
  corrugated-bottom frying pan. With this combination I set the ring to
  2.75-3.0.
  
  One way to test is to place a small dollop of batter in the frying
  pan. It should take about 1-2 minutes to brown. As the underside is
  browning, bubbles should be forming on the top surface. The
  consistency of the batter and the temperature of cooking are correct
  when the bubbles fail to burst when the underside is fully cooked.
  
  *  Now that I know what I'm doing, they're easy, but I had a awful
  lot of failures to start with.  Don't expect success the first time.
  You won't be disappointed.  The effort is worth it in the long run.
  What is important is to get the moisture content of the batter
  correct. If it is too sloppy; then the pancakes will be flat and
  stodgy. If the batter is too dry; then the pancakes will burn before
  they are cooked.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate until you learn the technique.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  COMBINE ALL INGREDIENTS except butter. If using a meat grinder, fit

  ground; then mix the separate batches together well. Form the ground
  meat into patties. To cook the sausage, melt the butter in a large
  skillet over medium heat on the stove and cook the patties 2-to-3

  reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the carrots are tender,
  5-7 minutes.
  
  Pour the contents of the saute pan into a food processor fitted with a
  metal blade or a blender and process or blend on high speed until
  smooth, 1-2 minutes.
  
  Pour the sauce through a fine mesh sieve back into the saute pan. Add
  the reserved boiled carrots and the parsley and bring to a boil.
  Reduce the heat to low, cover and keep warm while you cook the
  chicken.
  
  In a large saute pan over high heat, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon
  olive oil. Rub salt and pepper to taste onto both sides of the
  chicken breasts. Add the chicken to the hot pan, skin side down, and
  cook for 1-2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook
  the chicken, turning it occasionally, until opaque throughout when
  pierce with a knife, 12-15 minutes.
  
  Transfer the chicken breasts to the carrot-cumin broth, turning to
  coat them completely.
  
  To serve, transfer the chicken breasts to warmed shallow bowls and
  spoon the carrot-cumin broth over the tops.

  NOTES : 9/94 Jennifer liked this as individual frozen servings over
  rice. I froze them in the serving dishes then removed them from the
  dishes into individual twist tie bags to save space in her little
  freezer. She would pop one out of its bag and into a dish and zap it.

  a ribbon when the beaters are lifted.  Pour the batter into the
  prepared pan (it will be about 1 inch deep) and bake for 15 to 20
  minutes, until the cake is set and a toothpick inserted in the center
  comes out dry. Unmold the cake onto a rack and let it cool; it will
  fall to about half its original height. Meanwhile, in a double
  boiler, melt the remaining 3 ounces of chocolate with the remaining 1
  teaspoon butter. In a small heavy saucepan, bring the reduced cream
  to a boil, then whisk it vigorously into the chocolate. Continue
  whisking until smooth and glossy. Place sheets of waxed paper under
  the cake and cooling rack.  Pour the frosting over the top of the
  cake, using a metal spatula to spread the frosting evenly over the
  top and sides. After the frosting has hardened slightly, about 5
  minutes, use a long straight knife to mark the top in a crisscross
  pattern. Mix the cocoa with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and
  sprinkle it decoratively over the cake before serving.

      Title: BRETON APPLE TART
 Categories: Desserts, Pies, Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------APPLE FILLING----------------------------
      2 lb Golden delicious apples
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3 tb Butter
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Dark rum

MMMMM------------------------BRETON DOUGH-----------------------------
      1 c  Butter
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 tb Dark rum, optional
      4    Egg yolks

MMMMM----------------VARIATION:BRETON WALNUT TART---------------------

MMMMM-----------------------WALNUT FILLING----------------------------
  2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/3 c  Honey
      2 c  Walnut pieces
           - coarsely chopped
 
  Try substituting firm-ripe peaches for the apples in this filling for
  a seasonal variation. FOR THE APPLE FILLING: PEEL, CORE AND SLICE THE
  apples into a large saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients and cook
  the apples covered until they exude their juices. Uncover the apples,
  lower the heat and allow juices to evaporate. Cool the filling. FOR
  THE BRETON DOUGH: BEAT THE BUTTER UNTIL SOFT using a hand mixer set
  at medium speed or a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle. Beat in
  the sugar in a stream. Continue beating until the mixture lightens.
  Beat in the rum and vanilla, then the yolks, one at a time, beating
  until the mixture is very smooth and light. Using a rubber spatula,
  fold in the flour by hand, until the dough is smooth. Preheat the
  oven to 350F and set a rack in the lowest level. Butter a
  10-by-2-inch-deep layer pan. Cut a disk of parchment or wax paper and
  place in the bottom of the pan; butter the paper. Place half the
  dough in the pan and use a spatula to spread it evenly over the
  bottom of the pan. Spread the cooled filling on the dough. Flour the
  remaining dough and press it into a 10-inch disk on a cardboard or
  tart-pan bottom. Slide the dough over the filling and press it into
  place making sure that the sides are straight and even. Brush the top
  of the Breton with a beaten egg yolk. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until
  well colored. Cool on a rack. VARIATION: BRETON WALNUT TART: FOR THE
  WALNUT FILLING: BRING SUGAR, BUTTER AND HONEY to a boil, stirring
  occasionally. Boil 2 minutes. Stir in walnuts and cool. Proceed as
  for Breton Apple Tart, above.

      Title: BREWER'S CHICKEN
 Categories: Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    4-lb chicken; quartered
    1/4 c  Butter
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1    Onion; sliced thinly
      1 c  Beer
      4 tb Tomato paste
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt and pepper to taste
    1/2 c  Light cream
           Boiled rice; to serve
 
  Melt the butter and oil in a flameproof casserole or a heavy-bottomed
  pan large enough to hold the chicken in one layer. When the foaming
  stops, brown the chicken over medium-high heat, turning it until
  golden on all sides.  Remove the pieces from the pan and add the
  onion, cooking until golden and stirring frequently.
  
  Replace the chicken in the casserole or pan, mix the beer and tomatoe
  paste together and pour the mixture around the chicken. Add the bay
  leaf and seaon with salt and pepper. Cover and cook the chicken over
  low heat for 45 minutes or until tender.
  
  Place the chicken quarters on a bed of boiled rice and keep warm.
  Skim off any fat from the cooking liquid, stir in the cream and
  reheat without letting it boil, then pour it over the chicken and
  rice and serve.
  
  This recipe for chicken and beer comes from Switzerland's Tecino
  region, where the cooking tends toward Italian-style.

 Categories: Casseroles, Greek
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Eggplant
      2 lb Zucchini
      4 md Potatoes
      2    Green peppers
      1    Red pepper
      2 md Onions
      1 c  Olive oil
      4 md Tomatoes
      2    Garlic cloves
      1 ts Sugar
           Salt and pepper,
           -to taste
 
  Prepare the vegetables:  Cut the eggplant, zucchini and potatoes in
  bite sized chunks (do not peel the zucchini or the eggplant). Remove
  the stems and seeds from the peppers and slice them into strips. Peel
  and slice the onions. Dice the tomatoes.
  
  Saute the vegetables except the tomatoes in the olive oil in small
  batches. Saute each batch for 2 or 3 minutes, then remove from the
  pan, trying to drain some of the oil so that enough oil is left for
  the next batch. When you're done, most (if not all) of the oil should
  be gone from the pan. Place the sauteed vegetables in a baking dish
  and toss them briefly so that you won't get only one kind of
  vegetable in one place.
  
  Add the tomatoes into the pan and saute for a couple of minutes.
  Crush the garlic and add to the tomatoes. Add the sugar, salt and
  pepper to taste and simmer for another minute. Pour the tomato sauce
  on top of the vegetables and bake at 350 degrees F. or until the
  vegetables are tender.
  
  Serve with plenty of fresh bread and, if you like, some feta cheese
  on the side.

    1/2 ts Mint extract

      2 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
           Non-paralleils,

      2 ts Water
 
  Beat butter until soft; gradually add sugar and blend until creamy.
  Mix in beaten egg and extracts.  DON'T USE A FOOD PROCESSOR!!!
  
  Stir salt and baking powder into flour; stir into butter/sugar
  mixture.
  
  Melt chocolate in water over a double-boiler; add to dough. Form into
  a long roll approximately 2" - 3" wide. Wrap dough with plastic wrap
  and chill overnight.
  
  Slice dough 1/4" thick and place on greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle
  with non-paralleils and press in slightly with back of spoon. Bake in
  400 degree oven for 8 - 10 minutes. Cool cookies on rack.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  Can substitute 3 oz. semi-sweet chips for the chocolate.
  
  *  These cookies came about when my husband asked me to make
  chocolate-mint cookies for Christmas.  (They are based on the
  refrigerator cookies in "Joy of Cooking," with my own variations.)
  Although disappointed because he really wanted Girl Scout cookies
  (!), everybody else likes them and I've had several requests for the
  recipe. (Actually, my husband usually asks for chocolate chip
  cookies, no matter what time of year...)

      1 lb Any kind of meat.
 
  ~-----From the library of Charlie in Philly CJPV06A-----------------
  
  This is a recipe that was handed down from the days of my Hoboing it
  all most always came out good.
  
  First you find a red brick(One that has most of the mortar cleaned
  off). Next go to the back door of one of the homes near by, and ask
  if you can borrow, a burner on the stove to make your brick stew.
  When the person asks what brick stew is you show them the brick. You
  tell them that you might need to borrow some things to make it
  better.Then go to work. Wash off the brick, put the clean brick in
  the pot, add water to cover the brick, add the potatoes that you
  borrowed,the tomatoes, the onions,carrots, and any thing else you can
  get to stew, try to get some kind of meat allthough this is sometimes
  hard to do. Add the meat to the stew. Now see if you can get some
  salt and pepper it makes it tast better. Next bring to a boil and let
  boil until done if you can borrow some flour do so and get some more
  water mix the flour and water. With the pot at a boil add the flour
  and water mixture to thicken the stew. Next  ask you host if she or
  he would like to try some and if so borrow a dish for you and your
  host, oh yes do not forget the spoons and crackers or bread. Next sit
  down and eat your meal with your host. Then help with the dishes. Oh
  yes do not forget to throw away the brick. Recipe by Charlie in

      Title: BRIE EN CROUTE
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     16 oz Brie wheel
      4 oz Mushrooms, shiitake
           Butter; for sauteing
    1/4 ts Tarragon
      2    Garlic clove
      2 oz Wine
    1/2 lb Filo
 
  Also, baked Brie is fabulous.  If you want to get fancy with the brie,
  saut# some mushrooms with tarragon, garlic and a bit of wine until the
  mixture is almost dry (the mushrooms should be sliced or chopped, by
  the by), take a wheel of brie, slice it in half, put the mushroom mix
  in the middle, and wrap it in phyllo or puff pastry (the frozen puff
  pastry works fine).  Put in the freezer for 20 minutes to firm
  everything up.
  
  At this point, it can be moved to the fridge and kept until needed.
  Bake it in a moderate oven until the puff pastry browns. Let sit for
  15-20 minutes before cutting.
  
  You can also use puff pasty scraps to cut out little leaves and stuff
  to put on top of the whole thing for decoration. This is best with
  the small wheels, about
        5    inches in diameter.

 Categories: Appetizers, Holiday
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 ea 4 1/2 oz. each herbed cheese
      1 x  (Rondele or Boursin)
      2 tb Whipping cream
      2 lb Wheel Brie cheese
      1 lb Frozen puff pastry
      1 ea Egg beaten with 1 T water,
      1 x  For wash
 
  Mix the ream with the herbed cheese,  Spread on top of brie. Roll out
  both sheets of puff pastry to 14" squares. Place brie in center of
  first square, and cut circle 2" larger than the brie. Brush pastry
  with the egg wash, center the bottom of the brie on pastry. Make
  diagonal cuts in the edge of the pastry; brush with the egg wash, if
  it becomes dry, and fold against the side of the brie.  (Diagonal
  slits will help the pastry fit better.) Now, cut a second round of
  pastry from the other 14" square, egg wash, and then place the on top
  of the brie in the center. Make more diagonal slits to fit.  Use egg
  wash if necessary, and firmly press pastry dough to the sides of the
  brie. With a sharp knife, trim the excess. Take the scraps of pastry
  and make decorations, etc.  (You may cover this and refrigerate
  overnight, or at this point, freeze for up to 2 weeks.)
  
  Before serving, bring to room temperature.  Preheat oven to 400
  degrees. Place on ungreased cookie sheet and bake 35 to 40 minutes or
  until the pastry is golden. Let it rest at room temperature for 2
  hours before serving or the cheese will be too soft to cut. Serve
  this cut in small wedges.  It will serve 18 to 20.

      1 lb Brie Cheese (round)
      1    Pkg Boursin Cheese
      1    Egg

  Slice Brie in half horizontally. Spread Boursin cheese on one half.
  Re-assemble Brie and place in the center of pastry.
  
  Brush pastry edges with egg wash, and pull up sides to enclose Brie.
  Place seam side down on ungreased baking sheet. If desired, decorate
  the top with pastry scraps. Brush with egg wash.
  
  Bake for 20 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes (at least) before serving.
  
  Makes 12 servings.
  
  Source: Adapted from recipe included with Pepperidge Farms Puff Pastry
        (They 'stuff' the Brie with 1/4 cup sliced, toasted almonds and
         1/4 cup chopped parsley instead of Boursin)
  
  * Boursin cheese is a spreadable garlic and herb cheese. Boursin
  Poivre contains a lot of black pepper for those who like pepper.
  Boursin is available in many grocery stores but can almost certainly
  be found in higher quality produce and specialty stores. If Boursin
  or Boursin Poivre cannot be found, Alouette can be used as a
  substitute although it is not as high quality as Boursin, in my
  opinion.

 Categories: Appetizers, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Wheel
 
      1    Wheel of ripe brie (~5 lbs.)
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      1 c  Chopped fresh dill
    1/2 c  Poppy seeds
      1 c  Chopped watercress
      1 c  Slivered almonds
      1 c  Chopped chives
 
  "Although brie is not a fresh cheese, it, too, has a wonderful
  affinity for any number of herbs.  A large wheel topped with a
  variety of herbs and served with bread or crackers is a buffet in
  itself.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Cut off the top rind of the brie. Lightly
  mark the top of the cheese into four pie-shaped wedges with a knife,
  then divide each wedge into three more wedges, again marking lightly.
  Sprinkle half the walnuts onto one of the wedge-shaped areas and
  press them gently into the surface.  Repeat the process with half of
  each of the remaining ingredients, proceeding in order around the
  wheel. Allow the brie to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes
  before serving. The wheel can be loosely wrapped and refrigerated for
  as long as four hours.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------PATTI - VDRJ67A---------------------------

MMMMM-------------------DECORATE WITH CANDLES------------------------
 
   1). Candle wax cleanup: Where there are glowing candles, there can
  be some dripped wax. Colored wax, especially red, can cause stains.
  To remove hardened wax from washable fabrics, carefully scrape the
  excess with a knife. Place the stained fabric between several layers
  of white paper towels. Press with a warm (not hot) iron, replacing
  paper towels as wax is absorbed. If the spot remains, place the
  stained side down on whole paper towels; sponge the unstained side
  with cleaning fluid. Launder the cloth as usual. If any stain
  remains, do not put in dryer. Repeat the cleaning fluid process;
  apply liquid or spray laundry stain remover and wash with appropriate
  bleach.
   2). Place candles in the freezer for a while before lighting. They
  will burn more slowly and drip a lot less.
   3). Brighten an adult's dessert plate with soft candle glow by using
  the small candle holders designed to clip onto christmas tree
  branches. Insert a candle and clip to each dessert plate and light
  the candles just before serving for a sparkling, festive touch.
   4). Red apples can be made into candle holders by cutting holes in
  them with an apple corer or paring knife. Insert candles and tie
  colorful ribbons around them.

MMMMM-------------------DECORATE WITH CANDLES------------------------
 
   5). Candle arrangements in unusual containers can be creatively
  unique. Use items you have around your home. Try votive candles in
  fluted molds, saucer type champagne glasses, muffin pans or on
  inverted clay flower pots in clay saucers; surround with brightly
  colored ribbons, jingle bells, small shiny tree ornaments or pine
  cones. Florist clay or candles "stickem" can be used to secure the
  candles.
   6). Winter wonderland: Candles can be used to create an illusion of
  moonlight on snow covered boughs. Place white or ivory candles of
  various heights in glass holders. Group and surround them with
  snow-flocked evergreens. Intertwine metalic colored ribbons around
  candle holders. Use crystal angles or trees for a touch of fantasy.
  For a doubly beautiful effect, arrange grouping on a mirrored
  background to catch and reflect the light.
   7). Paper-Bag Luminaries: Can be made using small paper bags, plain
  or colored, sand and votive candles. Bags can be decorated by cutting
  out holes with scissors or paper punches, but make sure they are
  small so that the wind cannot put the candles out. Fold top of each
  bag down about 2" for added strength. Put about 2" of sand in each
  bag. Place candle in the center of the bag, making sure it does not
  touch edges; light the candle. Place 3-6' apart on edge of sidewalks,
  driveways and steps. Do not place near dry leaves or shrubbery.

      Title: BRIGHTON BEACH BAKE
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -===================
           -(serves 6 to 8)
 
  Ingredients:
  
  1 tsp   Sesame oil 2 medium sized onions 3 cloves garlic 20 g Brighton
  Beach Sewered Seaweed (aka Dried Arame) 3/4 lb Mushrooms 2 medium
  sized carrots 3 tsp Vecon or similar vegetable stock 2 tsp Mirin 1
  tsp Black Pepper 2 tsp Sea Salt 750 g Couscous lots Water Chop the
  onions and mince the garlic and fry in the sesame oil. Soak the arame
  for about 15 minutes in boiling hot water and then add to the onion
  and garlic *without* the water used for soaking.  Add the finely
  chopped mushrooms and the grated carrots.  Mix the stock in some
  boiling hot water and add to the dish. At the same time add the
  leftover water from soaking the arame. Add the mirin and salt and
  pepper to taste. It is probably best to have it slightly on the salty
  side as the saltiness will disappear when the couscous is added.
  Simmer the mixture covered for about 20 minutes.
  
  In a large mixing bowl add the couscous and the mixture together and
  any extra water required to cover. Leave for five minutes.
  
  Grease a large baking tray and line with baking parchment. Add the
  mixture to the baking tray and place in the oven covered with foil.
  Bake for about twenty minutes.  Remove the foil and if the bake is
  still too wet continue for another five to ten minutes. The top
  should be slightly browned, grill if necessary.
  
  We were originally going to add sesame seeds to this but forgot to as
  we were making it.  Sesame seeds might be a good idea and would be
  especially useful if you wanted a dish without any added salt. You
  can also use a dried seaweed blend instead of salt.

MMMMM-------------------TYPED BY LINDA FIELDS------------------------

MMMMM-----------------CYBEREALM BBS 315-786-1120----------------------

MMMMM-----------------------PASTRY BOTTOM----------------------------
  4 1/2 oz Flour
      1 tb Cocoa
      1 ts Baking powder
      2 tb Sugar
      1    Egg white

      2 tb Warm water
  3 1/2 oz Sugar
      3 dr Almond flavor
      1 pn Cinnamon
      3    Egg whites
  2 1/2 oz Flour
      1 tb Cocoa
      3 tb Cornstarch (heaping)
    1/2 ts Baking powder

MMMMM--------------------FILLING AND TOPPING-------------------------
      1    Lg jar dark pitted cherries
  2 1/2    - 3 1/2 oz Sugar
      4 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Cherry spirits
      2 ts White ground gelatine
      3 tb Water for blending
    3/4 pt Fresh double cream
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 tb Powdered sugar
      1 oz Grated chocolate
 
  For the pastry bottom:
  
  1. Mix together flour, cocoa, and baking powder; make a hole in the
  middle and pour in sugar and egg white, and mix until it is a thick
  paste. Cut the margarine in little blocks, and put them in the mid-
  dle and voer with a little flour and knead it all quickly with hands
  into a smooth, firm paste. If it is sticky, put it in the
  refrigerator for a short time. Grease the base of a 10" round
  cakepan, roll out the pastry to fit. Preheat oven for 5 minutes on
  VERY HOT (425F) and then reduce heat to 350F and bake for 20 minutes.
  
  For the Sponge Cake Mixture:
  
  1. Whisk the egg yolks with the water until frothy, then add 2/3 of
  the sugar, a little at a time, and continue whisking until the mix-
  ture is creamy and thick. Add the flavorings and the cinnamon. Whisk
  the eggwhites in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form and gradually
  whisk in the rest of the sugar. Pour the egg white mixture over the
  egg yolk mixture. Mix the flour, cornstarch and baking powder and
  sift over the egg white mixture. Fold all together very gently (DO
  NOT STIR OR BEAT). Line a round cakepan bottom, the same size as the
  pastry, with wax paper. Fill with the sponge mixture and bake
  immediately in a moderate oven (350F) for 30-35 minutes.
  
  For the Filling and Topping:
  
  1. Pour the cherries through a sieve, and collect the juice. Measure
  juice off to 1/2 pint, and if necessary fill up with water to make
  1/2 pint, and blend 4 T. of the juice with the cornstarch. Bring the
  rest of the juice to a boil, and remove from heat. Stir in the
  prepared cornstarch, return to heat, and boil up briefly. Mix in the
  cherries and put aside to cool When cold, sweeten to taste with the
  sugar and the cherry spirits. Blend the gelatine with water and set
  aside for 10 minutes to swell. Stir over low heat until gelatine is
  almost completely dissolved, then cool. Whip the cream until almost
  thick, then add the lukewarm gelatine mixture and the powdered sugar,
  continue whisking until it is quite stiff.
  
  2. Spread 1/2 of the cherry mix and 1/2 of the cream over the pastry
  layer base. Cut the sponge through once horizontally and lay one half
  on the pastry base. Press well. Cover with the rest of the cherry
  filling and 1/2 of the remaining cream. Cover this with the other
  half of the sponge cake and pile the rest of the whipped cream on
  top. Sprinkle with the grated chocolate. Cool well before cutting.

  For the Cake: Separate eggs and put in two different bowls. Beat the
  egg yolks with a third of the sugar until it is yellow and creamy.
  Beat the egg whites until very stiff, and then beat in the rest of
  the sugar. Sieve the four over the egg yolk mixture and then put the
  egg snow on top. Fold gently. Line a springform pan with waxed paper
  and grease the paper with some margarine, bottom only. Fill with the
  mixture and bake at 350F for 20-30 minutes, or until a toothpick
  comes out clean. Let cool a little, open the springform, invert the
  cake on a platter and take off the waxed paper carefully. When cake
  is completely cooled, cut gently in half. FOR THE PUDDING FROSTING:
  Combine pudding with milk and sugar in a small bowl, and beat slowly
  until well blended, about one minute. Fold in the non-dairy whipped
  topping. Cool in the refrigerator until nice and cool and stiff. Fill
  the middle of the cake, with a third and put the top of the cake on.
  Spread the rest all over as regular frosting. Heap up little mounds
  on the rim if it is a birthday cake and decorate with candies or
  chocolate or anything you would on a regular frosted cake. Put cake
  in the refrigerator over night. Makes a light, fresh cake even
  children love and you can add some cocoa to the cake mix to have a
  dark cake and frost with vanilla pudding or pecan.

      2/3 c  golden or dark raisins
        3 TB dark rum
        1    brioche loaf (recipe
  :          follows), -- halved
        1    stick (4 ounces) unsalted
  :          butter
        2 c  milk
        2 c  heavy cream
      3/4 c  sugar
        1    vanilla bean, -- halved
        8 lg eggs
  
  The day before, if possible, bring raisins to a boil in a pan of
  water and drain. Place plumped raisins in a plastic container that
  has a tight-fitting cover and sprinkle with the rum.
  
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Melt the butter and cool it slightly.
  
  Cut half the brioche loaf into thin slices. Cut remaining brioche in
  1/2-inch dice.
  
  Butter a 2 quart baking dish and add diced brioche. Strew with the
  raisins and half the butter. Dip one side of each remaining slice of
  brioche into the butter and arrange the bread, buttered side up and
  slightly overlapping on top of diced brioche and raisins.
  
  Combine the milk, cream, sugar and vanilla bean in a saucepan. Bring
  the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
  
  Whisk the eggs until liquid in a large mixing bowl, then strain the
  milk mixture and whisk it into the eggs. Do not overbeat or the
  custard will have a great deal of foam on the surface. Strain the
  custard back into the pan and skim the foam from the surface with a
  large spoon. Pour the custard over the brioche slices in the dish,
  pouring so that the bread is evenly soaked and rises to the surface.
  
  Place the baking dish in another larger pan and pour warm water into
  the pan to come halfway up the side of the baking dish. Bake the
  bread pudding for about 45 minutes, until the custard is set and the
  brioche is an even golden color.

  Vegetables may be added to the meat in a crock pot along with
  seasonings and the whole thing cooked 1O hours. 2- In a dutch oven,
  simmer 2 to 2 1/2 hours before adding vegetables, then continue until
  potatoes are done. 3- In a pressure cooker, bring brisket, water and
  seasonings to 15 # pressure and cook for 3O to 4O minutes. Reduce
  pressure under cold water, open cooker, add vegetables, cover, bring
  to 15# pressure and cook 5 minutes, reduce pressure again.
       However you cook it, remove meat, slice thinly on the diagonal,
  serve with green beans and potatoes drenched with cooking liquid. Do
  not thicken the natural gravy.   It has a lovely flavor and should
  not be greasy. If your meat is not well trimmed, remove excess fat

 Categories: Pileggi, Cowboy.001
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      2 tb Bacon grease or
           -vegetable oil
      3 lb Beef brisket, fat
           -trimmed and cut into
  1 1/2    In cubes
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper, freshly
           -ground
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      4 c  Beef stock (preferably
           -homemade or canned
           Low-sodium broth)
      2 cn (4 oz ea) chopped mild
           -green chilies, drained
      2 lb Red-skinned potatoes,
           -scrubbed and cut into
      1    In pieces
      2 c  Fresh or thawed frozen
           -corn kernels
    1/4 c  Fresh cilantro
           -(coriander) or parsley,
           -chopped
      1 c  Flour
 
  In a large flameproof casserole or Dutch oven, heat the bacon grease
  over medium heat.  Season the beef brisket with salt and pepper.
  Working in batches to avoid crowding, add the brisket and cook,
  turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes.
  Transfer the brisket to a plate.
  
  Add the onion and garlic to the casserole and cook, stirring often,
  until the onion is softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the beef stock.
  Return the brisket to the pot and add the chilies. Bring to a simmer
  over high heat, skimming off any foam that forms on the surface.
  Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the brisket is tender,
  about 2-1/2 hours.
  
  During the last 30 minutes, stir in the potatoes, corn, and cilantro.
  Remove from the heat and let stand 5 minutes. Skim any fat from the
  top of the stew. (It's easier to remove the fat if the stew is cooled
  to room temperature, covered and refrigerated overnight. Discard
  hardened fat from surface.  Reheat gently over low heat before
  proceeding.)
  
  In a small bowl, whisk 1 cup of the cooking liquid with the flour
  until smooth.  Stir into the stew and simmer until the sauce is
  thickened, about 3 minutes. Season the stew with additional salt and
  pepper; serve hot. Freezes and reheats well.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

  Walt:  I have a great recipe for brisket of beef.  It is easy, makes
  its' own great gravy and tastes even better as leftovers. This can be
  cooked either in slow cooker or the oven. Either way, put in the
  brisket, mix the onion soup with 2 cups of water and pour it over the
  meat. Pour the can of stewed tomatoes over the brisket. Place the
  cookies in the liquid, not on the meat.  You can break them up to
  fit. Seal the pan securely with aluminum foil. (If in a slow cooker
  just put on the lid.) Bake at 325 for three hours without peeking !!
  Take out the meat, and slice it thinly against the grain and return
  it to the pan with the gravy. Reseal and bake at 225 for about one
  hour. Make sure all the meat slices are covered by the liquid so the
  meat does not dry out. This is tender and delicious. The gravy is
  great over rice or wide noodles. FROM: BARBARA ZEGER (BNTH32A)
