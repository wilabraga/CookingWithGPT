      Title: B-B-Q SEITAN
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Portions
 
  1 1/4 lb Raw Seitan
           - (1 box Seitan Quick Mix)
    1/4 c  Oil for frying
      3    Strips kombu sea vegetable
           -- (2 to 3 strips,
           -- about 12 inches)
  1 1/2 c  B-B-Q sauce of choice
 
  Prep time: 1-1/2 to 2 hours (most of time is in cooking)
  
  Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and fry Seitan pieces for a few
  minutes on each side until lightly browned. Soak kombu until soft,
  then cut into sixteen pieces. Line bottom of 9-inch baking dish with
  half the kombu. Place a piece of fried Seitan on each piece of kombu,
  overlapping if necessary, to make an even layer. Place remaining
  pieces of kombu on top of each piece of Seitan. Pour B-B-Q sauce on
  top, then spread with a spoon to cover surfaces.  Gently add enough
  water so that the Seitan pieces are almost floating. Cover and bake
  at 350 F. for one hour. Add more water if necessary to keep Seitan
  very moist.
  
  This recipe has been developed by Bro. Ron Pickarski as part of his
  work toward being a participant and finalist in the Culinary Olympics
  held in Frankfurt, Germany.

      Title: B/M "SOUR" SOURDOUGH
 Categories: Breadmaker, Ethnic, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Anna Ellis DTXT63A
  1 1/4 c  Sourdough starter
    1/2 c  Water
      3 c  Bread flour
      1 tb Melted margarine
      2 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Yeast
 
  This basic recipe was from Anna Ellis (DMSD70C). I substituted oil
  for the margarine and with some experimentation, came up with this
  technique: Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle.
  When the cycle is complete, leave the dough in the pan for 3 to 4
  more hours. Remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a damp
  towel and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes minutes. Sprinkle corn
  meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves. Place
  loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover again with the damp
  towel and allow to rise for another two hours. At the end of two
  hours, refrigerate the dough, still covered, for at least 12 hours
  (the longer the better). Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with
  water, and let it sit out for 4 hours. Sprinkle again with water then
  bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown and crusty.

    1/2 pk Yellow cake mix (about 1 cup
  2 1/2 c  Bread flour
      2 tb Butter
  1 1/4 c  Very warm water
 
  Some people use the Jiffy mix.  I've also used this mix, and last
  time, I used the Duncan Hines yellow cake mix. I liked it just a bit
  more than the Cakebread with Jiffy.  I simply stored the leftover mix
  for my next loaf.

  I've been playing around with these ingredients and my husband thinks
  I should "go public" with this recipe! It's for a bread machine, but
  you could make it by hand in the conventional way, too. In my
  Zojirushi machine the crust is rather dark (but still delicious) so
  other machines may need a light crust setting. Enjoy! Place ingred.
  in B/M in order given (start at bottom for>>>> Welbilt/Dak) set crust
  to light and bake on white bread setting. I'm munching on the "heel"
  as I type and am thinking about how good a sandwich will be in a few
  hours! Maybe next time I'll add pepperoni and have all the sandwich
  ingredients in each slice. It has a real pizza taste! LINDA IN

  the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may
  need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
  it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
  dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
    * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
  microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your manufacturers'
  directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made
  a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I
  used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness
  button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a Welbilt). Let
  me know your results, we sure enjoyed it! FROM: LISA CRAWLEY (TSPN00B)

  Preheat the oven to gas mark 5/375F/190C. Prick the skins of the
  aubergines with a carving fork and bake in the oven for one hour, or
  until flesh is soft. Remove and allow to cool so you can handle them
  without burning your hands. Cut in half and scoop out the flesh into
  a bowl. Mash with a fork. You may prefer to use a food processor, but
  i like the rough finish achieved with a fork.
  
  Crush the garlic cloves with a hard blow from your hand on the back
  of a large sharp knife and then chop the pulp finely. Add this, along
  with the tahini, lemon juice and parsley, to the aubergine. Stir
  everything thoroughly, and add enough olive oil to give a rich thick
  consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with warm slices
  of pitta bread or hot toast.

      Title: BABA GHANOUSH (EGGPLANT APPETIZER)
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      2 ea Eggplants, about 1 1/2 lbs.
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Tahini (sesame seed paste)
      2 ea Cloves garlic, crushed
           Salt to taste
           Olive oil
           Freshly chopped parsley,
           Paprika or pomegranate
           Seeds to garnish
 
  1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Cover baking sheet with foil. Wipe
  eggplant and pierce with point of sharp knife. Place on prepared
  baking sheet and bake in preheated oven 35 to 45 minutes. When cool
  enough to handle, peel eggplants and remove seeds.  Place in
  container of food processor and sprinkle with lemon juice to keep
  from browning.
  
  2.  Add tahini, garlic, and salt.  Process until smooth.
  
  3.  Spread onto serving platter and pour small amount of olive oil
  over top.  Garnish with chopped parsley, paprika, or pomegranate
  seeds. Serve with warmed pita bread and crudites. Cover and store in
  refrigerator.
  
  Notes:  Baba ghanoush is a traditional dish of Lebanon and Syria, and
  is often served with raw or blanced vegetables. The combined flavors
  of eggplant, garlic, and lemon juice are very Mediteranean. For a
  smokey flavor, grill eggplant over hot charcoal instead of baking in
  the oven.
  
  Variation:  In Greece, olive oil is used instead of tahini. In Syria
  yogurt is added for a lighter tasting dish. In Turkey it is called
  Hunkar Begendi, tahini and garlic are omitted and 1 cup white sauce
  and 1/3 cup grated cheese are mixed into the eggplant and heated
  before serving.

           -each
      1    Clove garlic, peeled and
           -finely chopped
      5 tb Tahini (sesame paste)
    1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
      3 ts Salt
      2 pn Freshly ground pepper
           Chopped parsley, for garnish
 
  1. Heat oven to 425'. Place each eggplant directly over the flame of
  a gas burner or under a broiler, turning occasionally until skin is
  lightly charred, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and
  roast for about 30 minutes, or until the eggplants have shriveled and
  feel very soft all over when pressed. Let sit until cool enough to
  handle.
  
  2. Slit each eggplant open and remove seeds (don't worry if you miss a
  few). Scrape flesh from skin with a table knife and transfer to a
  large bowl. It's okay if some charred skin is included. Discard skin
  and seeds.
  
  3. Mash eggplant with a fork or whisk untl it is fairly smooth but
  still has a few lumps. Mix in garlic, tahini, and lemon juice. Add
  salt and pepper. Adjust flavors as desired. Garnish baba ghanoush
  with chopped parsley and serve at room temperature.

           Juice of 1/2 to 1 lemon
           -(to taste) or lime
           Handful of parsley or

           -and a lemon slice to
           -decorate
 
    * Sesame paste. I've heard of substituting peanut butter, but never
  tried it.
    The variable amounts of ingredients depend on your taste and on the
  size of the eggplant. Try it without celery and red pepper and then
  you can decide if you want to use it next time.
   Saute onions, (celery & red pepper) till starting to brown (I do in a
  wok). Add eggplant and garlic, stir well, add spices (not the salt),
  stir again and on very low fire, saute. May drop some liquid, that's
  all right, let it evaporate, and saute slowly until everything is
  very tender. Keep checking, it's better if it browns a little, but
  needs stirring so it doesn't burn. If it's too dry, add a few TBs
  liquid at a time (I use vegetable broth, liquid from steaming
  veggies, or liquid from microwaving mushrooms, etc. but water would
  probably do). Add salt, tahini and lemon juice, pulse a few seconds
  at a time in food processor or mash with potato masher -- can be
  slightly lumpy, too smooth is pretty awful.ÿAdd green stuff, pulse
  once or twice to chop coarsely and distribute or chop coarsely and
  stir in.
   It's an ugly color, so I try to dress it up with a lemon slice,
  greens and black olives, seems to help. Serve with quarters of pita
  bread or mini pitas, it's finger food, a great appetizer with a curry
  meal

      Title: BABI KECAP I (PORK COOKED IN SOYA SAUCE)
 Categories: Indonesian, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 kg (1 1/4 lb) fillet of pork
           -or leg of pork
      1 tb Clear soya sauce
      2 tb Plain flour
    1/2 ts Powdered ginger
     20 g  (4 oz) button mushrooms
      4    Cloves garlic
      1 sl Of root ginger, about 2 cm
           -(1") across and 1/2 cm
           -(1/4") thick
      3 tb Dark soya sauce
           Pepper or a pinch of chilli
           -powder
      2 tb Boiled water
      2 tb Medium dry sherry or rice
           -wine (optional)
      2 ts Lemon juice
      6 tb Oil or pork fat
 
  This, as its name suggests, is pork cooked in soya sauce. It is a
  particular favourite with my own husband and children, who always
  know when it is about to appear on the table because the ginger and
  garlic frying in the sauce smell so deliciously savoury.
  
  Cut the pork into small cubes.  Put the flour into a bowl and add the
  clear soya sauce and ginger powder, mixing them well together. Coat
  the pork with the mixture and then let it stand for at least 30
  minutes.
  
  Clean and slice the mushrooms.  Peel the garlic and ginger and slice
  them very thin; you can use these thin slices as they are, or cut
  them again into very tiny sticks.
  
  Heat the oil or fat in a wok or thick frying pan and fry the meat,
  half of it at a time, turning it from time to time, for 5 minutes.
  
  Repeat the process for the remaining half of the meat. The flour that
  coated the meat will tend to stay in the pan or stick to the bottom
  of it, but leave it there-it will thicken the sauce later. Now take
  most of the oil out of the pan, leaving only about two tablespoons
  which you then heat again.  In this, fry the tiny slices of garlic
  and ginger and the mushrooms, stirring continuously, for i minute.
  Add the soya sauce, the water and the meat. mix well, season with
  pepper or chilli powder, and stir continuously for 1 or 2 minutes.
  just before serving, add the sherry or rice wine and the lemon juice.
  Serve hot.
  
  This dish keeps extremely well in the freezer, and it is worth making
  a large quantity from, say, half a leg-of pork, which is much cheaper
  than buying pork fillet. If you are going to freeze your Babi Kecap,
  however, do not add the sherry or lemon juice at the time of cooking.
  To serve from the freezer, thaw the meat out completely and heat
  quickly on a high flame for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring or shaking the
  pan well all the time. Add the sherry or rice wine and lemon juice
  just before serving.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: BABI KETJAP (SOY PORK)
 Categories: Indonesian, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    500    Pork
    1/2 ts Pepper
           Salt
      1    Onion
      2 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Sambal Oelek (hot pepper
           -condiment)
      5 tb Sweet soy sauce (Ketjap
           -Manis)
    150    Water
           Margarine or Oil
 
  There are quite a few pork dishes in the book (including another
  version of this one).  Evidently minorities are well enough
  represented that pork has earned a place in the cuisine of
  predominantly Muslim Indonesia. I think this would be excellent done
  with 1 inch long pieces of baby back ribs. I also won't stew it as
  long as I did++or maybe use bigger chunks of pork. I used pieces
  between a half and a quarter inch on a side and the meat got a tad
  dried out.  No complaint on the taste though! I'll also toss in a
  couple of scallions cut into one inch chunks just before it's done
  stewing. I was out of sambal oelek so I used some tuong ot toi cut
  with a little lime juice. Worked good.
  
  Dice Pork, rub in salt and pepper and fry in hot oil or margarine.
  Then add the finely sliced onions, spices and the hot pepper
  condiment.
  
  After this add the water and the soy sauce.  Bring to the boil and
  simmer for at least half an hour until the meat is done.
  
  Serve Babi Ketjap on a large plate, garnish with sliced tomatoes and
  chopped vegetable pickles.  Eat with plain or savory rice or Mei.
  
  From "Indonesian Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London,
  1986."
  
  For those who aren't familiar with it, Kecap Manis (or ketjap manis)
  is a thick, sweet Indonesian soy sauce that does wonderful things for
  meat and poultry as a marinade/BBQ sauce as well as a condiment.

      Title: BABKA YABLOCHNAYA/ APPLE CHARLOTTE WITH APRIC
 Categories: Candies, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 tb Unsalted butter -- softened
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter --
           Clarified
      3 tb Unsalted butter --
           Clarified
     16 sl Homemade white bread --
           Crusts removed
      5 lb Tart red apples, peeled,
           Cored -- thinly sliced
      1 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Water
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  With a pastry brush, lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 1 1/2
  quart, 3 to 3 1/2 inch deep charlotte or other straight-sided mold
  with the tablespoon of softened butter.
  
  Pour all but 3 tablespoons of the clarified butter into a large bowl.
  With a sharp knife, cut three slices of the bread into 6 triangles by
  slicing them in half diagonally. Cut another 7 slices of bread in
  half. One at a time, briefly dip the bread triangles into the bowl of
  clarified butter and lay them side by side in the bottom of the mold.
  With a small, sharp knife, trim the triangles so that their points
  meet in the middle and no spaces show between the slices.  Now dip
  the bread halves in the butter and stand them upright around the
  sides of the mold, overlapping them slightly. The bread will rise
  slightly above the top of the mold.
  
  Cut another 3 slices of the bread into 1 inch squares. Heat the
  reserved 3 tablespoons of clarified butter in a heavy 10- to 12-inch
  skillet set over high heat and drop in the bread squares. Turning
  them about constantly with a wooden spoon, cook the squares for 2 to
  3 minutes, until they are lightly and evenly coloured on all sides.
  Remove the browned bread squares from the pan with a slotted spoon
  and set aside.
  
  In a 4 quart casserole combine the apples, sugar and water. Bring to
  a boil over high heat , then cover tightly, reduce the heat to low,
  and simmer 30 minutes, or until the apples are tender and show no
  resistance when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Uncover and
  cook over high heat, stirring frequently, for about 15 minutes, or
  until most of the liquid has evaporated and the apples become a
  thick, coarse puree. Stir in the cinnamon and refrigerate the puree
  until well chilled.
  
  When ready to assemble and bake the dessert, stir the browned bread
  squares into the apple puree and pour the mixture into the prepared
  mold. Do not be concerned if the filling rises above the rim of the
  mold; the apple puree will subside as it bakes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F.  Cut 2 of the remaining slices of bread in
  half, dip them in butter and place them on top of the filling. Cut
  the remaining slice into narrow strips, dip them into the butter and
  arrange them around the top to cover the exposed areas.
  
  Bake in the center of the oven for 1 hour or until the bread is golden
  brown.  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature, then invert a flat
  serving platter on top and, grasping the plate and mold firmly
  together, turn them over.  Let the mold rest in this fashion for
  another 30 minutes before gently lifting it off the cake.
  
  Either pour the apricot sauce over the top and sides of the unmolded
  apple charlotte, or serve it separately in a bowl.

 Categories: Soups/stews, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 c  Milk
      2 ts Tabasco sauce
      4 ts Worcestershire sauce
      4 tb Chicken base *
     16 oz Cheeze Whiz
      6 tb Cornstarch
    1/3 c  Water
      1 c  Beer
    1/8 ts MSG (I did not use)
           Cayenne pepper
 
  Combine milk, Tabasco, Worcestershire, chicken base, & MSG. Bring to a
  boil, stirring regularly.
  
  Add Cheeze Whiz, after warming in hot water or in microwave. Mix in
  well.
  
  Dissolve cornstarch completely in the water.  Add to soup, which
  should thicken immediately.  Reduce heat a bit and stir in beer.
  
  To serve, ladle into bowls and dust with cayenne pepper.
  
  *Chicken base can be found in the spice section.  I used Schilling's
  Chicken Flavor Base.  Spice Islands also has a product called Chicken
  Flavor Stock Base that is probably the same thing.
  
  I would like to give credit to Scott Hammon, whose extra efforts
  succeeded in wrangling this recipe from Baby Doe's chef. Since it's
  been many years since I sampled this soup at the restaurant in
  Dallas, I can't judge how closely this approximates the original.
  But at least the results are tasty! Hope all who try it will enjoy it.

    1/4 c  Sour Cream
      1 tb Fresh Chives, chopped
           Salt and Pepper
     20    Prawns, cooked, shelled and

           Deep-Fried thin strips of
           Carrot, Zucchini, leek,
           & Eggplant for garnish
 
  Leek Molds: Lightly oil 4 individual 1 cup souffle dishes, about 4" in
  diameter and 2" deep. Linewith clear plastic wrap, smoothing out
  wrinkles as much as possible and leaving ends extended over tops of
  dishes.
  
  Trim off leek tops so leeks are about 5" long. Blanch leeks in large
  pot of boiling water 2 to 3 minutes until leeks are tender but still
  retain their shape. Plunge into ice water.
  
  Cut bottom portions of leeks in lengths the same height as the souffle
  dishes, about 2". Stand leek pieces on end around inside edge of each
  souffle forming a leek "shell," with white portions of leeks toward
  bottom of dish. Set aside.
  
  Tomato Gelatin: Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in small saucepan to
  soften. Puree 16 cherry tomatoes in food processor. Sieve to remove
  seeds and skins. Add tomato puree to gelatin mixture. Stir over
  medium heat until gelatin dissolves and mixture almost boils.
  
  Reserve half the gelatin mixture at room temperature. Divide remaining
  gelatin mixture among the 4 souffle dishes. Cover and refrigerate
  until set, about 1 hour.
  
  Tomato Confit: While molds are setting, in large skillet, saute
  chopped onion in hot olive oil over medium high heat until soft.
  
  Add quartered cherry tomatoes. Cook, stirring constantly, until
  tomatoes are very soft and form a saucelike consistency. Remove from
  heat. Stir in basil, thyme, white vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste.
  
  Pour into bowl, and refrigerate to cool.
  
  Herbed Cream Filling: In small bowl, combine sour cream, chives, salt
  and pepper to taste.
  
  Assembly: Reserve half the tomato confit. Spoon remaining confit over
  set gelatin in souffle dishes.
  
  Top with a spoonful of cream filling in center, then cover with
  remaining tomato confit.
  
  Carefully spoon a layer of the remaining gelatin mixture atop each
  souffle.
  
  Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours until set.
  
  To Serve: Gently loosen plastic wrap from sides of souffle with a
  knife. Lift gelatin molds out of souffles using extended ends of
  plastic wrap as "handles." Peel plastic wrap from sides.
  
  Lift molds off plastic wrap with a spatula and center each mold on a
  serving plate.
  
  Garnish each with 5 prawns and deep-fried vegetables, if desired.

  liquidize again. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  Heat a griddle or a large heavy pan over a moderate heat until it is
  hot, and brush it with melted butter. Stir the potato batter, drop it
  in tablespoonfuls on to the griddle to form small rounds, and cook the
  pancakes until bubbles appear on the surface. Add more melted butter
  as necessary. Turn the pancakes, and cook them on the other side
  until they are golden. Transfer them to a platter and keep them warm,
  covered, in a very low oven until ready to serve.

    1/4 ts Salt
      1 lg Egg
      8 tb Goat cheese

  Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Beat egg into cooked milk
  mixture. Add to dry ingredients and mix lightly just until dry
  ingredients are moistened. Spoon 1/3 of the batter into 12 greased
  muffin cups. Place 2 teaspoons of goat cheee in center of batter in
  each cup. Cover cheese with remaining batter, dividing among each of
  the muffins. Bake approximately 20 minutes in a preheated 350 degree
  F oven, or until brown and springy in the center.
  
  Serve muffins hot or cool.  If desired, a 3/4-inch cube of cream
  cheese may be substituted for goat cheese. Without cheese, muffins
  are still delicious!

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 tb Tomato paste
      1 tb Tamarind pulp
    1/2 tb Shallots; chopped
    1/4 c  Sherry vinegar
  1 1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 ts Kosher salt
      1 ds Black pepper
      1    Red onion
  1 1/2 tb Balsamic vinegar
      6 c  Spinach
 
  Recipe by: Ed Kasky, Executive Chef at Engine Co. No. 28, Los Angeles
  Preparation Time: 0:30 FOR THE DRESSING: Place the tomato paste,
  tamarind pulp, shallot, and vinegar in a blender an mix well. Slowly
  add the oil a drop at a time at first and then in a slow b steady
  stream until it is all incorporated. Add the salt. Can be kept in th
  refrigerator for 1 week.
  
  FOR THE ONIONS: Peel and slice one large red onion thick enough so
  that you can handle the slices and they will not fall apart when you
  cook them. Rub them with a little olive oil and cook the onions over
  a charcoal fire or under a hot broiler until soft. (Approximately 5
  to 6 minutes per side.) Toss in a bowl with 1-1/2 tablespoons
  balsamic vinegar so that the slices become single rings. These will
  keep refrigerated 2 to 3 days.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE THE SALAD: Wash and dry one medium handful (about 1 cup)
  spinach for each portion and toss with enough dressing to coat each
  leaf, being careful not to over-dres the salad. Arrange the onions
  over the salad and serve. Always serve salads on chilled plates.
  
  CHEF'S NOTE: Tamarind pulp can be purchased at Latin specialty stores.

  "A tasty and nutritious teething cracker, far superior to anything
  you will find for sale at the supermarket. These make thoughtful
  gifts for babies and their parents. For an alternative baby teething
  cracker, try the Zwieback recipe on page 139. 325~F. 60 to 70 minutes
  Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  In the food processor or in a large bowl, stir together the flour,
  corn meal, salt, and sugar. Add the egg and mix well. Blend in enough
  of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
  ball.
  
  On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll into a rectangle about 3/8
  inch thick. With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 1-1/2- by 3-inch
  rectangles. Place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
  sheet. Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until the crackers are thoroughly dry.
  Cool on a rack. These crackers should be hard. If necessary, put them

  half or quarters first. Bring the water to a boil and simmer until
  the potatoes are just tender when pierced with a fork, 15-20 minutes.

  In a heavy pan such as a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium
  heat. Add the onions, reduce the heat to very low and slowly saute
  about one hour. Stir occasionally, watching that the onion doesn't
  burn. A few dribbles more of oil may be necessary. Pre-heat oven to
  300F degrees. Turn up the heat, add the garlic and tomato and cook,
  stirring constantly until the mixture becomes thick and the liquid is
  substantially reduced, about 10-15 minutes. Add the ham, parsley,
  pepper, cinnamon and cloves, then gently stir the cod, potatoes,
  jalapenos and their juice into the tomato mixture. Transfer to a 1 to
  2 quart casserole, preferably clay, sprinkle with the olives and bake
  for 30 minutes. Bacalao a la Viscaina can be made ahead and re-heated
  in a 300F oven for 20 minutes or until thoroughly hot.

 Categories: Fish, Cuba, Update
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Thick salt cod, desalted
           -and cooked (see Notes
           -below), and
 
  cut into 2- by 3-inch pieces (reserve 4 cups of the soaking liquid)
  Flour for dredging 1/2 cup pure Spanish olive oil FOR THE SOFRITO:
  1/4 cup pure Spanish olive oil 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and
  finely chopped 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 large onions, finely
  chopped 1 cup finely chopped drained pimientos 2 1/2 cups canned
  crushed tomatoes 1 tablespoon Spanish paprika or mild paprika 1/4 cup
  dry white wine Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste TO
  COMPLETE THE DISH: 4 medium-size all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut
  into 1/2-inch slices 3 pimientos, cut into strips, for garnish Fried
  Bread Rounds (recipe follows), as an accompaniment Notes: One day in
  advance of serving, rinse the salt cod under cold running water. Cut
  it into 2- by 3-inch pieces, place in a bowl, and cover with cold
  water. Change the water several times until it is no longer salty.
  This process should take 24 hours. Drain the fish, place it in a
  small saucepan, cover with fresh water, and bring to boil over
  medium-high heat. Lower the heat to low and simmer 5 minutes. Drain
  and cool the fish. 1. Dredge the cod in the flour. In a large skillet
  over medium heat, heat the oil until fragrant, then cook the fish
  until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove the fish
  from the heat and set aside. 2. For the sofrito, in a large saucepan
  over medium heat, heat the oil until fragrant, then cook the bell
  peppers, stirring, until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce
  the heat to low, add the garlic and onions, and cook, stirring, until
  tender, 6 to 8 minutes, adding more oil if necessary. Add the
  pimientos, tomatoes, paprika, and wine and cook, stirring
  occasionally, until thickened, another 10 to 12 minutes. 3. Place the
  reserved salt cod soaking water in a medium-size saucepan over
  medium-high heat and cook the potato slices until partially tender,
  10 to 15 minutes. 4. Add the codfish chunks to the sofrito and cook
  over low heat 10 minutes. Arrange the cooked potato slices on top of
  the fish, do not stir, cover the pan, and shake it several times.
  Cook over low heat an additional 10 minutes so that the potatoes
  absorb the fish flavor. Transfer to a large serving platter and
  garnish with the pimientos. Serve with Pan Frito (Fried Bread Rounds)
  and Arroz Blanco (see CUBA07.TXT). Makes 8 servings BACALAO A LA

  This came from one of the other cookbooks I picked up last weekend.
  Nice segue, eh?
  
  Inherited from Spain, this codfish dish is a favorite of the
  Mexicans. Soak codfish for 8 hours in enough cold water to cover it.
  Drain and shred the fish. Saute the onion in the oil until it is
  softened. Add codfish and saute a few more minutes.  Add the
  remaining ingredients. Simmer slowly until codfish is tender, about
  1/2 hour or more.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      6 ea Basic kitchen hints
 
     Room temperature is what most of your ingredients should be at
  before you use them.  This can help considerably when you're trying
  to beat egg whites, or make a cake or bake bread.
  
     Milks and other liquids added to batters, soups or sauces should be
  brought to room temperature before you begin the recipe, or they can
  be heated briefly at a low setting in the microwave or in a pan of
  warm water. (Heating them directly takes longer and may scorch them.)
  
     Meats that are at room temperature cook faster and some meats can
  be more tender if the fat has had time to de-solidify.

  that is satisfying. And an added plus - the soup is better a day or
  two after it is made. Store it in a covered container in the
  refrigerator.
  
  Cut bacon into thin slivers.  In a 12 cup saucepan, combine
  bacon,celery, carrots, onion, turnip, beef broth, bay leaf and thyme.
  Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes or
  until vegetables are tender. Add beans and continue to simmer 5-10
  minutes or until hot, and flavors are blended. Remove the bay leaf
  and ladle into warm soup tureen or soup bowls. Makes 8 servings.

      Yield: 12 Muffins
 
      4 sl Bacon
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt

    1/2 c  Sourdough starter
    2/3 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil or bacon
           - drippings
 
  In a skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Reserve bacon
  drippings, if desired.  Drain cooked bacon on paper towels. Crumble
  and set aside.  Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners; set
  aside. Preheat oven to 400~F.  In a large bowl, sitr together flour,
  baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar. Stir in cheese; set
  aside. In a medium bowl, beat egg. Stir in sourdough starter, milk
  and oil or drippings. Add to flour mixture.  Stir with fork until dry
  ingredients are just moistened. Fold in crumbled bacon. Fill prepared
  muffin cups 2/3 to 3/4 full with batter. Bake in preheated oven 20 to
  25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from muffin cups.  Serve hot.
  
  Great for breakfast with a glass of orange juice! These turned out
  absolutely WONDERFUL.  I would suggest greasing the muffin tins very
  well. The cheese tends to make them stick a little!

MMMMM--------------------------THE CAWL-------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Collar bacon with rind
      3 pt Water

MMMMM-------------------------VEGETABLES------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Potatoes
      1 sm Swede (rutabaga)
      3    Mature carrots
      2 lg Leeks (or spring onions)
      2 tb Chopped parsley

MMMMM--------------------SAUCES FOR THE MEAT-------------------------

MMMMM-------------------MUSTARD AND EGG SAUCE------------------------
      2 oz Butter
      1 oz Flour
      1 ts Dry mustard powder
    1/2 ts Powdered tumeric
    1/2 pt Cawl stock & milk mixed
      1    Hard-boiled egg
      1 tb Vinegar

MMMMM-------------------SPICED TOMATO KETCHUP------------------------
      1 lb Ripe tomatoes
      1 sm Onion
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/4 ts Powdered cloves
      1 oz Sugar
      1 tb Malt vinegar
           Salt and pepper
      1 sm Green chili (optional)

MMMMM------------------PARSLEY-AND-CHIVE SAUCE-----------------------
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Flour
    1/2 pt Cawl stock and milk mixed
      2 tb (heaped) chopped parsley
      1 tb (heaped) chopped chives
           Salt and pepper
 
  Wash the joint to remove surface blood.  Put the meat into a large
  clean pan and cover well with water. Bring to the boil, then turn the
  heat down, cover with lid and simmer for 2 hours. Top up if the water
  sinks below the level of the meat - at the end of the cooking you
  should have 2 pints of liquor.  Leave it to cool, meat and all, and
  lift off the white hat of grease (it makes good dripping after
  heating gently to drive off the water).  Some families like the fat
  left in.
  
  Prepare the vegetables - scrub, peel and cut them into bite-sized
  chunks as appropriate.  Wash and slice the leeks into 1/2-inch rings.
  Then make the sauces.
  
  For the MUSTARD AND EGG SAUCE: Melt 1 oz butter in a small pan. When
  it froths, sprinkle in the flour and fry for a moment until mixture
  is sandy. Stir in the mustard powder and tumeric and immediately
  whisk in the broth and milk.  Whisk till the mixture thickens. Chop
  the egg and stir in. Finish with the vinegar and beat in the extra
  ounce of butter. Taste and add salt and pepper.
  
  For the SPICED TOMATO KETCHUP: Chop the tomatoes, skin and chop the
  onion. Put all the ingredients except the optional chili into a
  lidded saucepan. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat, leave to
  simmer gently for 30 minutes.  Push the contents of the pan and boil
  it fiercely for a few minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve
  either hot or cold. Finish with a few slices of deseeded chili if you
  like it hot.
  
  For the PARSLEY-AND-CHIVE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a small pan, stir
  in the flour and let it cool for a moment. Whisk in the liquid
  gradually and stir over the heat until the mixture thickens. Mix in
  the herbs, taste and add salt and pepper.  Reheat the meat in its
  broth (the cawl). Remove the meat and keep it warm while you cook the
  root vegetables in the broth. Five minutes before you are ready to
  serve, add the leeks. While the vegetables simmer, plain-boil the
  potatoes separately. Stir the chopped parsley into the soup just
  before you bring it to table.
  
  As a second course, serve the meat with the potatoes, and the three
  sauces.

      to spreading consistency.
  
  3.  Crumble bacon and stir into cheese with celery and onion.
  
  4.  Using rubber spatula, spread cheese thinly over softened cracker

      be patient and persevere.  You'll get there.)
  
  5.  Cover with turkey slices.
  
  6.  Dip avocado in lemon juice, then place on top of turkey.
  
  7.  Arrange Romaine leaves in a single layer over all. Sprinkle with

  markets.
   Neufchatel cheese, in case you are wondering, looks and tastes just
  like cream cheese, but counts as a meat card instead of a fat card.

      Title: BACON POTATO PIE
 Categories: Casseroles
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Bacon, thick-sliced
           -and lean
      1    Onion
      1 lb Baking potatoes
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese
      8    Eggs
 
  Cut the bacon slices into square pieces.  Fry the pieces until
  well-cooked, then drain on paper towels.
  
  Peel the potatoes, then grate them.  To prevent the grated potatoes
  from discoloring while you prepare the other ingredients, you can put
  them into a bowl of cold water. When you're ready to use them, be
  sure to drain well and squeeze them dry.
  
  Grate the cheese.  Mince the onion.  Butter a 9x13 inch shallow baking
  dish. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Beat the eggs in a large bowl.  Add all the other ingredients and
  stir. Pour the mixture into the baking dish and bake in the preheated
  oven for about 45 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked. Serve hot,
  warm or at room temperature.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A brunch casserole with potatoes, eggs, bacon and cheese -- This
  is a very easy brunch dish, similar to a fritatta in texture, but
  full of traditional breakfast ingredients. The recipe comes from a
  cookbook published by the _Contra Costa (California) Times_
  newspaper, called "Tastes of the Times." Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  It really does make a difference if you use good meaty bacon for
  this. I find the best bacon at my local butcher shop.
  
  *  You can prepare part of this ahead.  I think egg dishes are better
  if they haven't been refrigerated. So if you want to work ahead, you
  can cook the bacon, grate the cheese and potatoes and mince the onion
  the night before. Store all these things separately in the
  refrigerator, covering the potatoes with water. Then in the morning
  just mix it all up and bake it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (tedious).
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: BACON-WRAPPED MUSHROOMS
 Categories: Appetizers, Meat
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 lb Bacon
      1 lb Fresh mushrooms, washed
           Toothpicks
 
  1. Cut the mushrooms in half. If it is a very small mushroom, leave it
  whole. If it is an oversized mushroom, cut into thirds or fourths.
  
  2. Slice bacon in half (width-wise) at an angle. To do this, hold the
  knife perpendicular to the bacon, then turn the knife slightly so
  that the knife is now at an angle, then slice the bacon.
  
  3. Take a slice of bacon and wrap it around a mushroom half, overlap
  the ends, and poke a toothpick about half-way into the mushroom at
  the overlap.
  
  4. Repeat this for each bacon slice and mushroom half.
  
  5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  6. Arrange mushrooms on a drip pan about 1/2-inch apart. Bake for 20
  minutes. Serve hot.
  
  NOTES: Depending on how thick the bacon is, you may need more than 1
  pound. Also, don't let soak mushrooms in water or they'll absorb too
  much water and then they'll shrink and crack.

MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
      6    Peach half, canned; drained
           Watercress
           Scallions
 
  Marinade:  Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.
  
  Chicken:  Mix chicken and marinade together in a large bowl and
  refrig- erate for 30 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade and
  lightly coat chicken with flour. Heat oil in a large skillet over
  medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned.  Remove from skillet
  and keep warm. In the same skillet, add mushrooms, wine and 6
  tablespoons of the ginger sauce. Simmer over medium low heat for 5
  minutes. Do not over cook.
  
  In a blender, blend the first 8 ingredients together until smooth,
  then add the red pepper flakes and the sesame oil and blend well.
  Refrigerate.
  
  Crepes:  Beat the eggs well. Beat in the milk, salt, flour and the
  melted butter until smooth, or in a blender all together. Let stand
  30 minutes before cooking. Heat a 10-inch skillet until fairly hot,
  but not smoking. Film with butter.  Use a small measuring cup or pour
  several tablespoons of the batter into the pan. Quickly tilt the pan
  to spread the batter evenly in the pan. Cook until lightly browned.
  Turn with a spatula and cook other side for about 30 seconds. Stack
  the crepes, using a sheet of waxed paper between each cooked crepe.
  
  To assemble: Remove the chicken from the warming dish and cut into
  bite-sized pieces.  In the center of a cooked crepe, using a slotted
  spoon put one-sixth of the cooked mushrooms, one-sixth of the cooked
  chicken, 1 tablespoon of the ginger sauce and a sprinkle of chopped
  green onion. On a serving dish, spoon some of the juice from the
  cooked mushrooms and 1 tablespoon of the ginger sauce. Pull up the
  sides of the filled crepe to form a bag.  Then tie the top of the
  crepe with a strand of the green onion, to hold the crepe upright.
  Put the crepe on the juices in the serving dish. Garnish with 1
  drained peach half, several sprigs of the watercress and some sliced
  green onion.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    Bagel
    1/8 ts Garlic powder
    1/8 ts Onion powder
    1/8 ts Cumin
    1/8 ts Oregano
    1/8 ts Fat-free parmesan cheese
    1/8 ts Chili powder
 
  Preheat oven to 400 or toaster oven works fine.  With a sharp knife,
  slice bagel into very thin slices so that you can almost see through
  them (you'll get about 10 slices). Place slices on a baking sheet.
  Lightly spray with cooking spray.  Quickly sprinkle in a small amount
  of seasoning (a little goes a long way) or leave plain. Bake for 3 to
  4 minutes until lightly browned-be careful; they burn easily. Break
  each slice into 4 chips.

      2 tb Honey
      2 ts Salt
  1 1/3 c  Whole wheat flour
  2 2/3 c  Bread flour
  2 1/2 ts Yeast
 
  Set for dough cycle.Let the machine knead the dough once, and then
  let the dough rise for only 20 minutes in the machine. Even if your
  cycle runs longer, simply remove dough after 20 minutes and turn off
  the machine. Divide the dough into the appropriate number of pieces.
  Each piece should be rolled into a rope and made into a circle,
  pressing the ends together. You may find it necessary to wet one end
  slightly to help seal the ends together.
  
  Place these on a well greased baking sheet, cover and let rise only
  15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring to a slight boil in a "nonaluminum
  pan", (Donna German uses a cast iron frying pan) about 2 inches of
  water. Carefully lower about 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the water,
  cooking for about 30 seconds on each side. Remove bagels, drain on a
  towel, sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame seeds or dried onion bits if
  desired and place on the greased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated
      550    degree oven for 8 minutes.
  
  This recipe is from Donna German's first Breadmachine Cookbook, pages
  160- 161.

      1 tb Sugar
      1    Cornmeal
      1    Egg yolk
      1 tb Water
 
  Combine warm water, yeast and sugar.  Let stand 5 minutes, stir in
  salt. Gradually mix in 4 cups of flour, beat at medium speed for 5
  minutes. With spoon add 1 1/4 cups more flour to make a stiff dough.
  Turn out on a floured board and knead until smooth, elastic, and no
  longer sticky (about 15 minutes), adding more flour as needed. Dough
  should be firmer than for most yeast breads.  Place in a greased
  bowl, cover, let rise until almost doubled (about 40 minutes). Knead
  dough lightly and divide into 12 equal pieces. To shape, knead each
  piece, forming it into a smooth ball. Holding ball with both hands,
  poke your thumbs through the center. With one thumb in hole, work
  around perimeter, shaping bagel like a doughnut 3 to 3 1/2 inches
  across.  Place shaped bagels on lightly floured board, cover lightly
  and let stand in a warm place for 20 minutes. Bring the 3 quarts of
  water and 1 tbls sugar to boiling in large kettle. Adjust heat to
  keep it boiling gently. Lightly grease baking sheet and sprinkle with
  cornmeal. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Gently lift one bagel at a time
  and drop into water, boil about 4 at a time, turning often, for 5
  minutes. Lift out with slotted spatula, drain briefly on a towel and

  wheat flour, 1/2 cup wheat germ, and about 2 3/4 cup all purpose
  flour, blended together. Knead with white flour. PUMPERNICKEL BAGELS:
  Follow basic recipe, omitting sugar. Use 3 T dark molasses in place
  of sugar.  In place of flour use 2 cups rye, 2 cups whole wheat, 1
  3/4 cups all purpose flour blended together.  Knead with white flour.
  ONION BAGELS: Add 1/2 cup instant toasted onion to basic dough with
  the yeast , water and sugar in basic recipe. SEEDED BAGELS: Springle

  * (Water which peeled potatos have cooked in. Plain water may be
  used, but it's not as good.)
     Sift together dry ingredients.  Soften yeast in 1/3 of potato
  water. Add to flour.  Add oil to remaining potato water and stir into
  the flour mixture.  Add eggs and stir briskly to form a ball of
  dough. Knead on a lightly floured board for 10 minutes.  (This MUST
  be a firm dough) Add more flour if necessary.  Return to the
  bowl--smooth side up. Cover with a towel (tea etc) and let rise at
  room temperature until the dough rises to the top of the bowl.  Knead
  again on a lightly floured board until smooth and elastic (as for
  rolls). Pinch off pieces of dough and roll between the palms of the
  hands to form ropes about 6 inches long and 3/4 inches wide. Pinch
  the ends together firmly to make a doughnut shape.
   Add sugar to boiling water.  Drop bagels into water one at a time.
  As they come to the surface, turn them over. Boil 1 minute longer on
  the second side.  Place on a greased cookie sheet and bake at 450 F.
  until the crust is golden brown and crisp--10 to 15 minutes. Bagels
  may be sprinkled with poppy seed or sesame seed before baking if you

      Title: BAGELS 4
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/3 c  Warm water
      1 ts Salt
      4 c  All-purpose or bread flour
           -(I prefer the high gluten)
      2 tb Sugar
      1 c  Milk
      1    Egg
           -beaten with a little water,
           - (for glaze)
           Coarse salt, (optional),
           Poppy or sesame seeds (opt.)
 
  1. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, stir, and let dissolve. 2.
  Put the salt, flour, and 4 tsp of the sugar in food processor bowl
  with dough blade. Pulse several times to mix well and aerate. 3.
  Combine yeast mixture and milk in a measuring cup. With processor
  motor running, piur through feed tube. Knead until mixture balls
  together and is no longer sticky, about 60 seconds. Lightly flour
  alarge plastic bag, place the dough in it, squeeze out the air, and
  close the end of the bag with a twist tie. Let the dough rise until
  doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch it down. (At this point the dough
  can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. Bring it to room temperature
  before proceeding.) 4. Let the dough rest for ten minutes. Pull of
  pieces of dough to form 12 two inch balls. Poke a finger through the
  ball, making a hole the size of a golf ball. With fingers, shape the
  bagel evenly. Put the bagels on a cookie sheet, cover with oiled
  plastic wrap, and let them rise until puffy, about 30 minutes.
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 5. Bring 4 qts. water to boil in a
  wide pot. Add the remaining two teaspoons sugar. Poach the bagels, 3
  or 4 at a time, for 30 seconds. Turn them and poach for 30 seconds
  more. Remove with slotted spoon, let drip briefly on towel and the
  place 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Brush each bagel with a little
  of the egg glaze. (At this point sprinkle on any of the optional salt
  or seeds.) Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool on racks.

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  1 1/2 ts Yeast
      2 c  Bread flour
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Water
      1 tb Barley malt syrup

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPINGS-------------------------------
      2 tb Poppy seeds, sesame seeds,
           -kosher salt, minced onion
 
  From "The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever", by Madge Rosenberg 1.
  Add all ingredients for the dough except the barley malt syrup in the
  order suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the dough
  cycle according to the manufacturer's directions.
  
  2.  at the end of the dough cycle, remove the dough from the machine.
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a large pot bring 2 quarts of
  water to a boil.
  
  3.  While the water comes to a boil, divide the dough into 8 pieces.
  Roll each piece into a roll 12 inches long. Make a circle of each
  piece, overlapping the ends by at least an inch and pressing or
  rolling the overlap tightly to seal.  Let the bagels rise for only
        5    minutes.
  
  4.  Add the malt syrup to the boiling water. (The syrup gives the
  bagels their golden color.)  Lower a few bagels at a time into the
  boiling water. As soon as the bagels rise to the top, remove with a
  skimmer or spatula to a lightly greased baking sheet. Sprinkle about
  3/4 tsp. of any of the toppings over each bagel and bake 20 minutes,
  or until golden.

      Title: BAGGED SAUSAGE
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           SEE DIRECTIONS:
 
  I love the unique flavor of aged pork sausage. I have even put the 2
  pound plastic wrapped bags of store sausage in the refrigerator for
  about 3 weeks to let them age. This is probably a risky practice but
  it has worked in a pinch. The risk with any aged sausage is botulism
  (literally "sausage sickness", if that gives you a hint). By sealing
  the casing with fat, anearobic conditions are created. During natural
  aging, it is not unusual for meat to be in the "danger zone" at least
  part of the time. If botulism organisms are present and can out grow
  the benign aging organisms, a lethal product results. The good news
  is that both the organism and the toxin are destroyed by ordinary
  (160 deg. F.) cooking temperatures.
  
  Many years ago, my father and grandmother taught me how to make and
  age bagged sausage. It is hung in the garage or shed or smokehouse
  for several weeks and the aging conditions are dependent upon the
  weather, therefore, every batch is a different experience. The trick
  is to get the full flavor without letting it get too strong. I have
  never had any spoil. This past winter I accidently re-discovered the
  value of smoke as an effective preservative.
  
  Usually, we let the bags hang without smoking. We keep sampling until
  we like the flavor then freeze what we won't eat within a couple of
  weeks. Last winter we put up 66 bags weighing 2.5 pounds each! Before
  they attained a real good flavor, we had a serious cold snap with
  lows in the single digits. Afraid that the sausage and the meat in
  cure would freeze, I cut a green hickory tree and built a smoking
  fire on the dirt floor of the smokehouse. I had a lot of trouble
  getting the kindling started and threw a few extra oak slabs on to
  get things hot enough for the hickory to catch. It was too cold to
  hang around and watch the fire. When I checked on it about three
  hours later, thick smoke was pouring from the eaves. On opening the
  doors I found a lively fire, heavy smoke and the temperature was up
  to 120 deg. F. The sausage was dripping fat and condensate was
  dripping from the roof. I managed to keep the fire smouldering for
  the next two days but I was afraid I had oversmoked during that first
  day. The sausage had a strong (not unpleasant but definitly dominant)
  smoke flavor). I sampled sausage over the next month and it was not
  getting that familiar aged flavor; nor was it going bad. It was very
  good but not what I was used to. In addition to being an excellent
  breakfast sausage, it was fantasic on pizza (even dominating
  anchovies) and made a killer spaghetti sauce. I finally froze most of
  the bags but kept a few back to see what would happen. It is now
  June; twenty weeks after we hung the sausage. I still have one bag
  hanging and one that I am using! There is no sign of spoilage and the
  taste and aroma is indescribable. I just fried some up to make sure
  it was still good - it's wonderful; kinda like the best lebanon
  raised to the third power! Next year I will try stopping the aging
  process with smoke after it is ripe.
  
  Bagged Sausage:
  
       25 lb Fresh pork sausage, seasoned
       10    Sausage bags
  
  Use only freshly ground seasoned pork sausage. If seasoned with a
  commercial mix, add extra sage to taste (we test fry samples as we
  season). Make bags of cotton feed bags or unbleached muslin. Cut
  rectangles 8" X 16" and stitch bottom and side allowing 1/4" for
  seams resulting in a 3 3/4" finished bag. Soak bags in water. Stuff
  sausage by hand and squeeze down hard so as to eliminate air and
  squeeze fat through bag (some people waxed them). Twist end tight,
  tie and hang in cool place (smoke house or garage) until distinctive
  aged flavor develops. Do not allow to freeze during aging.
  Temperatures should average in mid 30's; 38 is ideal. Weather with
  lows in upper 20's and highs in low 40's will age sausage in 3 to 4
  weeks. If warm, check to see that sausage is not getting too strong
  or spoiling. May be cold smoked for 24 hours or longer at less than
  100F using hickory or apple wood. Always cook aged sausage to well
  done. Do not wrap in plastic to store in refrigerator because of
  mold. Seal cut end with grease and store uncovered or hang.

      Title: BAIGAN BHARTA
 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 md Eggplant
      2 tb Veg oil
      2    To 3 serrano chiles, seeded
           And diced
    1/4 ts Compound asafetida (or < 1/8
        ts Pure)
      1    To 2 tsp cumin seeds
      2 ts Ground corriander
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
    2/3 c  Nonfat yogurt
      1    To 2 tsp garam masala
 
  Someone on r.f.v.c requested a recipe for Baigan Bharta yesterday;
  here is one from Yamuna Devi's "The Best of Lord Krishna's Cuisine",
  slightly tweaked, that I make a lot. (also posted on r.f.v.c.)
  
  Bake the eggplant 40 minutes at 425F on a baking sheet. Split it and
  scoop out the pulp; discard the skin. (Some people roast the eggplant
  over charcoal for a nice flavor).
  
  Heat the ghee on medium; add cumin seeds, serranos, and asafetida.
  Cook until the cumin seeds darken.  Add the eggplant, salt, and
  corriander; cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occassionally. When
  it thickens, remove from the heat, add the yogurt, cilantro, and
  garam masala, and serve. (The yogurt might curdle; to prevent that,
  let the eggplant cool first, then add the yogurt etc, then briefly
  reheat.)

      Title: BAIGAN BHARTA (MASHED EGGPLANT)
 Categories: Vegetables, Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 md Eggplants
 
  Cooking the eggplant: Poke the eggplants (say 2, medium sized ones)
  with a knife, and insert slivers of garlic in the slits. The eggplant
  can be roasted either in a conv. oven, a microwave, or ideally, on a
  slow charcoal grill.  When they are done (they become kinda' limp),
  peel, and mash up the insides. Use a knife to cut up the long fibres.
  Seasoning: In a wok, heat some oil, and add chopped onions, and
  chopped ginger. Fry till the onions are semi-browned, and then add
  the mashed eggplant. Add salt, and pepper to taste. Season with lots
  of chopped cilantro (coriander leaves). Since the eggplant is already
  cooked, you need not cook for long in the wok... just long enough to
  mix things up good. A tomato or two chopped fine, and added with the
  eggplant also tastes good. Alternative sesoning: Chop onions, ginger,
  tomatoes, and cilantro, and mix *cold* with the mashed eggplant, and
  a few table spoons of mustard oil. The mustard oil gives a nice tangy
  taste. Look for mustard oil in your nearest Indian grocery store.
  (Salt and pepper too.)

    1/4 c  Hazelnuts, lightly toasted
           -and coarsely chopped
      4 oz Bittersweet chocolate, cut
           -into 1/2-inch chunks

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
    3/4 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Bailey's Irish Cream Liqueur
      1 tb Confectioners' sugar
      2 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
           -coarsely chopped
           Warm chocolate sauce
 
  ESPRESSO CAKE: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and
  preheat to 350 F. Lightly butter an 8-inch square cake pan. Dust the
  pan with flour and tap out the excess. Place the ground espresso into
  a cup or small bowl. Heat the water to boiling and pour it over the
  espresso powder. Allow the grounds to steep for 5 minutes. Strain the
  coffee through a double layer of cheesecloth. Measure 1/4 cup of the
  coffee and set aside. In a large howl, using a wire whisk, stir
  together the flour, baking soda and salt. Sift the mixture onto a
  large piece of waxed paper. In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty
  electric mixer using the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium
  speed for 1 to 2 minutes until creamy. Gradually add the sugar,
  blending well between additions, and scraping down the sides of the
  bowl when necessary.  Add the eggs one at a time and beat until
  combined. Add vanilla and sour cream. On low speed, add half of the
  flour mixture and beat until combined.  Add the 1/4 cup of espresso,
  and mix well. Add the remaining flour mixture.  Scrape the batter
  into the prepared pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the cake
  begins to pull away from the sides of the pan and a tester inserted
  into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove pan from oven and
  set on a wire rack to cool completely.
  
  CHOCOLATE CHUNK MOUSSE: Put the chocolate in a food processor fitted
  with the metal chopping blade. Process for 20 to 30 seconds, until
  finely ground. In a small saucepan, combine the milk, sugar and salt.
  Cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar
  dissolves and the milk comes to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat.
  Add the vanilla extract and 1/4 cup of the Bailey's. With the motor
  of the food processor running, pour the hot milk through the feed
  tube. Process for 10 to 20 seconds, until the chocolate is completely
  melted. Using a spatula, scrape the chocolate mixture into a large
  bowl and cool for about 5 minutes, until tepid. In the 4 l/2-quart
  bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle attachment, beat
  the mascarpone at medium-low speed just until softened. Gradually add
  the rest of the Bailey's, scraping down the side of the bowl as
  necessary. Switch to the wire whip attachment, and beating on medium
  speed, add the heavy cream. Increase the speed to medium-high and
  continue beating 2-3 minutes, until soft peaks are formed when the
  whip is lifted. Using a large rubber spatula, fold one-third of the
  whipped cream mixture into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold
  the remaining whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. Fold the
  toasted nuts and chocolate chunks into the mousse.
  
  ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Line an 8-inch square pan with foil, leaving a
  2-inch overhang on two opposite sides of the pan. Using a long
  serrated knife, slice the cake horizontally into two layers of equal
  thickness. Place the top layer, cut side up, in the bottom of the
  pan. Scrape the mousse onto the cake layer in the pan. Smooth the top
  with a small metal cake spatula. Place the second layer, cut side
  down, on top of the mousse. In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty
  electric mixer using the wire whip attachment, combine the heavy
  cream, Bailey's, and confectioners' sugar and beat on medium-high
  speed until medium-stiff peaks are formed when the whip is lifted.
  With a small metal spatula, spread the top of the cake with the
  whipped cream. Sprinkle the chocolate chunks over the whipped cream.
  Freeze the cake for 6 hours or overnight. Remove the cake from the
  freezer. Lift it out of the pan, using the overhanging pieces of foil
  as handles, and set it on a cutting board to temper for 30 minutes.
  With a sharp knife, trim the four sides of the cake, then cut into
  eight 4-inch-by2-inch bars. Serve on dessert plates with warm
  chocolate sauce.

      Title: BAILEY'S TRUFFLE FUDGE
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 64 Pieces
 
MMMMM-------------------AMERICAN MEASUREMENTS------------------------
      3 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
      1 c  Vanilla chips OR
           -More chocolate chips*
    1/4 c  Butter
      3 c  Powdered sugar
      1 c  Bailey's Irish Creme
    1/2 c  Chopped nuts; optional

MMMMM----------------------TRUFFLE TOPPING---------------------------
      1 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
    1/2 c  Vanilla chips OR
           -More chocolate chips*
      2 tb Butter; cut in pieces
      4 tb Bailey's Irish Creme
 
  *Bailey's Original Irish Creme gets its flavor from a blend of Irish
  whiskey and fresh cream, which is delivered daily to the Dublin plant
  that makes the liqueur. This dessert is packed with chocolate and
  rich flavor. Using all semisweet chocolate will yield a deeper,
  darker fudge.
  
  FUDGE: Melt all chips with butter until they are soft enough to stir
  smooth. Do not overheat. Add chocolate/butter mixture to powdered
  sugar and Baileys. Stir until smooth. Add nuts, if desired. Mix well.
  
  Place fudge in an 8-inch square pay sprayed with vegetable spray. Lay
  a sheet of plastic wrap on top and gently press to smooth fudge.
  
  TOPPING: Melt chips until smooth. Remove from heat. With a fork, beat
  in butter and Bailey's until smooth.
  
  Spread topping over fudge with a knife. If a very smooth top is
  desired, use a piece of plastic as done on fudge.
  
  Refrigerate until firm, 1 to 2 hours. Can be frozen. Makes 64 pieces.

      Title: BAILEYS ICE CREAM
 Categories: Ice cream, Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Double cream
      1 c  Full fat milk
      1 c  Castor sugar
    1/2 c  Baileys
           Pinch salt
 
  Whisk all of this stuff together until all the sugar has been
  dissolved.
  
  Then freeze as you would normally freeze ice cream, either in an ice
  cream maker or in a tub in the freezer whisking every half hour or so.
  
  Because of the alcohol content of this ice cream it will usually take
  around 12 hours to become hard.  It does freeze hard so taking it out
  the freezer 10 minutes before serving is advised.  It does melt
  quickly so you have to eat it fast.
  
  Don't put any more Baileys into the mix.  1/2 a cup may not seem much
  but the flavour comes through very strongly.
  
  I prefer this with a little Baileys poured over it.
  
  Make it and enjoy it.  That is an order!

      1 c  Unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Finely chopped walnuts or
           Pecans
 
  Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder together and set aside. Cream
  the butter until soft and gradually add the sugar. Add the flour
  mixture a little at a time and mix well. Refrigerate for one hour.
  Divide the dough in half and keep one portion in the refrigerator
  while rolling out the other to approximately 1/4" thickness. (The
  dough gets soft quickly.) Sprinkle the dough with the nuts and gently
  press them in with the rolling pin. Cut into 1-1/2" squares. Pix uses
  a paper pattern as she is hopeless at estimating things like this,
  unlike Faith. Prick with a fork and place the squares on an ungreased
  cookie sheet. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Bake until golden
  brown, approximately 15 minutes in a preheated 350F oven. Makes 6
  dozen squares. This is a devostatingly rich, crumbly cookie.

      Title: BAJAN BLACK BEAN SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Dried black beans, soaked
           -overnight
      1 lg Or 2 small ham hocks
      3    To 3.5 quarts water
      3 tb Olive oil
      2    To 3 large onions
      4    Cloves garlic
      3 sm Fresh green peppers
           -(jalapeanos if preferred)
      8    Berries allspice coarsely
           -crushed
      2 ts Brown sugar (or 1 t of
           -molasses)
      3 tb Tomato paste
    3/4 c  Creme fraiche or sour cream
 
  Salt Grated rind and juice from one lemon
  
  Put the drained beans and hock in a very large pan, cover with the
  cold water and bring gradually to a boil. Leave to simmer while you
  prepare the other ingredients.
  
  In a frying pan heat the olive oil, then gently fry the onion, garlic
  and chili with the allspice and lemon rind, stirring occasionally,
  until the onions are translucent. Add this mixture to the beans and
  go on simmering for 2 hours, by which time the beans should be
  tender. At this point add the sugar, lemon juice, and tomato puree.
  Cook for another 30 minutes. Add salt if necessary.
  
  Remove the hock, and pick off any meat.  If you would like a smooth
  soup, as mine (the author) was, process the mixture in batches and
  return with the meat to the pan. Otherwise, for a rougher texture
  crush with a potato masher.  If the mixture seems too thick at this
  stage, add more water and bring back to the boil for a minute or two.
  
  Ladle the soup into bowls, with a spoonful or two of cream stirred
  in, and serve with a crusty bread.
  
  If you are feeling lavish, a couple of spoons of dark rum added
  towards the end give a Bajan fillip.
  
  INFO TEXT: Arriving stiff and crumpled inside and out after an eleven
  hour flight, this was my first taste of Bajan Cooking, and I ate it
  late at night trying to imagine the sea beyond a dark frieze of
  langourous palms. Dense but smooth, with a snap of chili, the soup
  was both homely and exotic, and very restoring.
  
  Barbados produces splendid ham and bacon, and a ham stock is what
  makes this different from other Carribean variants. Or, as here, use
  a hock, soaked first to remove some salt.

      Title: BAK KU TEH (PORK RIB TEA SOUP)
 Categories: Side dish, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Pork back ribs, chopped
           -into 2-inch lengths
      1 lg Clove garlic, crushed
      6 c  Water
      1    Stick cinnamon
      3    Whole star anise
      1 ts Whole white peppercorns
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      3 ts Salt
      3 tb Dark soy sauce, or to taste

MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
      2 tb Crisp Fried Shallot Flakes
           Soy sauce and thinly
           -sliced red chiles for
           -dipping
      2    Chinese crullers, sliced
           -(Optional)
           Steamed white rice
 
  I think the only "Singaporean" dish I have is one for a curried
  noodle dish known as Singapore Noodles every where in Asian except
  Singapore where they never seem to have heard of it. Stay tuned
  though. I'll see what I can come up with.
  
  Well, it's a little later and we're in luck!  I found three Singapore
  recipes in Joyce Jue's "Asian Appetizers". Here's da foist...
  
  Although most Asian lunches and dinners include a soup, there are
  certain soups which are served as a snack or even for breakfast. In
  Singapore, one of my favorite ways to start a day is to trek over to
  a hawker's stall and have a bowl of pork rib "tea" (actually a clear
  soup tinted with soy sauce).  It comes with Chinese crullers for
  dunking, and a strong black tea which I think of as the "espresso" of
  teas. This recipe comes from the Straits Cafe in San Francisco. The
  crullers, baguette-shaped fried savory pastries, may be purchased at
  better Asian markets.
  
  1.  Combine the pork, garlic, and water in a large saucepan; bring to
  a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Skim and discard the scum from the
  surface. Add the cinnamon, star anise, peppercorns, sugar, salt, and
  soy sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the pork is
  tender, about 45 minutes.  Discard the excess fat from the soup
  before serving.
  
  2.  Serve the soup in deep bowls with 3 to 4 rib pieces per serving
  and shallot flakes scattered over the top. Combine soy sauce and
  chiles to taste in small bowls as a dipping sauce for the ribs. Serve
  with cruller slices for dunking into the broth, and a bowl of rice on
  the side.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  CRISP FRIED SHALLOT AND GARLIC FLAKES:
  
  Cut 8 shallots or garlic cloves crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices;
  you should have 3/4 cup of slices. The slices must all be of equal
  thickness to assure even cooking.  Heat 2 cups of vegetable oil to
  300F in a preheated wok, saucepan, or skillet.  Add the slices and
  fry slowly for 3 to 5 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. They
  should be completely dry with no remaining moisture.  Remove with a
  fine strainer and drain on paper towels.  When cool, store in an
  airtight container. The flakes will keep for several weeks. Makes
  about 1/2 cup.
  
  Makes about 1/2 cup.
  
  NOTE:  The flavored oil can be strained and used for stir-frying.

  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    2/3 c  Cold water
      1 pn Salt
    1/4 ts Baking powder
           Vegetable oil for frying
 
  Cut the cod into 4-inch sections.  Place in a glass or earthenware
  bowl, cover with cold water, and soak overnight. The next day, drain
  and discard the water. Put the cod in a pot and cover with cold
  water. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and lift out the
  cod with a slotted spoon. Remove the bones and the black skin.
  
  In a medium bowl, combine the flour, water, salt, and baking powder
  to make a thin batter.  Dip the cod in batter and fry in hot oil
  (about 1/2 inch deep) on both sides, then lower heat and cook until
  tender, turning once again.  Serve hot, with skordalia, which is cold
  or room temperature.
  
  Note: If the cod is excessively salty, change water 2 or 3 times
  during the soaking period.

      9 c  All-purpose flour -- sifted
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Double acting baking
           Powder*
 
  This Mix collection is from a company called Jewel. I don't think that
  their product is available any longer, so I have substituted just the
  word shortening for the Jewel shortening. I have had excellant
  results using either Crisco or (lately) Mazola shortening in these
  recipes. Unfortunately, I think the Jewel shortening has gone to the
  shortening heaven with Spry and several others whose name eludes me
  now. Thank goodness the recipes have survived!  *4 Tablespoons
      Combine sifted flour, salt and baking powder. Stir well. Sift
  into a large bowl or pan. Add shortening. Use a pastry blender to
  distribute shortening throughout dry ingredients until the mixture
  resembles coarse cornmeal and small peas. The Bake-It-All Mix is now
  ready to use or store in a canister on your cupboard shelf. A cool
  area is desirable. Yield: About 12 cups

 Categories: Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Apples
    1/3 c  Brown Sugar, packed
    1/4 c  Raisins
      2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/3 c  Yogurt, low-fat
    1/4 c  Maple Syrup
 
  +----------------------*** MAPLE YOGURT SAUCE
  ***------------------------- * A large, firm, tart apple is best. Use
  Ida Red or Northern Spy. A Cortland can be used. However, if you use
  a McIntosh, you must shorten the cooking time. Core apples and remove
  top inch of peel. Make a shallow out through skin around centre of
  each apple to prevent skin from bursting. Place apples upright in
  baking dish or pie plate. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar,
  raisins, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spoon into centres of each apple. Add
  water to cover bottom of dish. Bake, uncovered in 375 F for 25 to 30
  minutes for less firm apples and up to 50 minutes for firm varieties
  or until apples are tender when pierced with a toothpick. Combine the
  yogurt and maple syrup to make the sauce. Pour over the baked apples.

 Categories: Chinese, Pork
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 tb Grated ginger
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Sugar
    3/4 c  Water
      1 tb Peanut or corn oil
      1 c  Finely chopped onion
      3 c  Cantonese barbecue pork, in
           -1/2-inch dice (about 1-lb.)
      1 tb Cornstarch mixed with 1
           -tablespoon water
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2    Egg yolks
      2 tb Water
      1 ts Sugar
           Chinese Baked Sweet Bread
           -Dough (recipe follows)
      1 pk Active dry yeast (1
           -tablespoon)
      3 tb Sugar
      1 c  Warm milk (100 to 110)
      1    Egg
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour, + more
           -for dusting and kneading
 
  Reheat in a 350 degree F. oven for 5 minutes, or microwave at high
  about 1 minute.
  
  Prepare bread dough. Cut out twenty 3-inch squares of parchment
  paper. Mix together ginger, oyster sauce, hoisin, dark soy, sugar and
  water in a bowl.
  
  Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot, add onion;
  stir-fry until soft. Don't brown. Add pork and stir-fry 30 seconds.
  Pour in sauce mixture, bring to a boil. Stir cornstarch/water into a
  smooth mixture. Add to pork; cook, stirring until thick, about 15
  seconds. Add sesame oil. Remove to bowl; refrigerate until thoroughly
  chilled.
  
  Cut dough in half. Form each half into a 12-inch long log; cut into 10
  pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch circle. Roll outer inch of each
  circle 1/8-inch thin; leave middle slightly thicker.
  
  If right-handed, place a dough circle in palm of your left hand. Put
  a big tablespoon of pork mixture in the ; middle; put left thumb over
  the pork. With your right hand, bring up edge and make a pleat in it.
  Rotate circle a little and make a second pleat. As you make each
  pleat, gently pull it up and around as if to enclose your thumb.
  Continue rotating, pleating and pinching, then gently twist into a
  spiral. Pinch to seal. Place bun pleated side down on a parchment
  square. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Put buns 1 1/2
  inches apart on a baking sheet. Let rise until doubled in size, 30
  minutes to 1 hour.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat egg yolks with water and sugar;
  brush over buns. Bake 20 minutes.
  
  Makes 20 buns.
  
  CHINESE BAKED SWEET BREAD DOUGH
  
  Chinese bread dough is quite sweet compared with Western breads (the
  further south you go in China, the sweeter the dough becomes). Most
  Chinese breads are steamed, which is why they look pale and uncooked
  to the Western eye.
  
  Put the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Add 1/4
  cup of the warm milk. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir to dissolve. If
  should foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh
  package of yeast. Stir in the egg, oil and remaining milk.
  
  Put the flour and remaining sugar in the work bowl of a food processor
  fitted with the metal blade. Process 2 seconds. With the machine
  running, pour the warm milk mixture down the feed tube in a steady
  stream. Process until it forms a rough ball. If ball is sticky and
  wet, add a little more flour. Process a few seconds longer, or until
  dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove dough to a
  lightly floured board.
  
  Knead dough, dusting with flour to keep it from sticking, until
  smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a large oiled bowl,
  cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled,
  about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down dough and place on a lightly floured surface. It is now
  ready to form into rolls, buns or loaves.
  
  Makes enough for 20 barbecued pork buns. Joyce Jue, San Francisco

 Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Dry navy (pea) beans
  1 1/2 ga Boiling water
      1 lb Salt pork -- thinly sliced
      2 tb Salt
      2 c  Bean cooking liquid
      2 c  Dark molasses
      1 c  Packed brown sugar
      4 ts Dry mustard
      2 ts Instant minced onion
 
  Line four 8x8-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap. Allow
  enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six servings
  or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be served
  without freezing.
  
  Add beans to boiling water; return to boiling.  Boil beans 2 minutes;
  then soak beans 1 hour (or overnight, if preferred).
  
  Add salt pork and salt to beans.  Cook beans slowly until tender,
  about 1 1/2 hours.  Drain; save 2 cups cooking liquid. Mix bean
  cooking liquid, molasses, brown sugar, mustard, and onion. Pour over
  beans. Mix gently. Pour one-fourth of mixture into each baking dish.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Bake
  1 hour or until beans are lightly browned and sauce is desired
  consistency.

  wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
  together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
  food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
  tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
  food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
  immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderatae). Remove
  freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Bake 1 1/2 hours or until
  center is hot.

  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Combine the skim milk, egg white and
  pepper to make a seasoned egg wash.
  
  Dip the fillets into the egg wash, then dredge them in the bread
  crumbs. [Let sit for 10 minutes.]
  
  Lay the fillets on a nonstick baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.
  
  NOTE:  For me this dish is a marvelous replacement for fried fish.
  
  Sauce:  Combine all ingredients and refrigerate in a tightly covered
  container.
  
  NOTES:  This sauce will keep for a week if stored as suggested. Use
  this as you would regular tartar sauce with any dish. Try it as a
  replacement for mayonnaise on sandwiches and in salads.

      Title: BAKED CHICKEN W/MINT & RED ONIONS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Fresh mint leaves (don't
           -chop or tear up)
    1/4 c  Rice wine
    1/4 c  White wine vinegar
           Chicken pieces w/skin
           -(drumsticks, thighs,
           -breasts)
    1/2    Red onion (or several small
           -red onions)
      4    Garlic cloves
           Salt and pepper
           Dried rosemary
 
  1.  Trim the excess fat from the chicken pieces, but leave at least
  some of the skin on.  I personally like the taste of chicken skin,
  but I can understand wanting to remove it for health reasons.
  Compromise--leave just a little bit on!  Place in a bowl with the
  rice wine and vinegar. Let marinate for at least 30 min.
  
  2.  Lay a piece of foil over the bottom of a baking dish. Grease the
  surface of the foil, and lay a bed of mint leaves on top of it. Use
  only enough so that the chicken will neat little bed to lay upon!
  
  3.  Cut the red onion into coarse pieces.  Sprinkle loosely on top of
  the mint leaves.  Sprinkle some salt over the onion and mint.
  
  4.  Peel the garlic cloves, and cut each in half. Take the chicken
  out of the marinade and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper to
  taste. Place the pieces on top of the mint and onions. Take the
  garlic pieces and place them between chicken pieces (or even on top,
  if you like!)
  
  5.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for around 30 min. (depending on how
  much chicken you used), or until fully cooked. Fully cooked means
  that when you poke a knife next to the bone, there won't be any
  bright red blood running out.  Turn chicken pieces over once during
  baking. When done, turn the oven onto broil and broil the chicken,
  skin side up, for about 5 min., or until skin is lightly brown.
  
  Serve with rice!  The mint and onions soak up a lot of nice flavor,
  and the garlic turns out slightly roasted and soft. I like to pour a
  little soy sauce and sesame oil on top of my rice with this dish, but
  that's just me.

  stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until golden. Reduce heat to
  medium-low; stir in cornmeal until well coated. Stir in milk, salt

  Saute the onion and garlic in olive oil over moderate heat until soft
  but not brown. While onions are cooking, blanch the spinach in
  lightly salted boiling water for a few seconds until wilted. Drain
  and immediately plunge into ice water to stop the cooking and set the
  color. Drain again and gently squeeze as much of the moisture as
  possible out of the spinach with a clean tea towel. Coarsely chop
  spinach and combine with onion mixture. Season with salt, pepper and
  nutmeg.
  
  Over an open flame or under a broiler, char peppers on all sides.
  Remove and cover loosely with plastic for a few minutes to sweat and
  then scrape off charred skin with the point of a knife. Remove and
  discard seeds and stems and cut peppers into long thick slices.
  
  Lightly butter or oil a small terrine or loaf pan (8x4x2 1/2 inches)
  and line the bottom with buttered waxed paper or parchment.
  
  Beat the eggs briefly together with the herbs and season with salt and
  pepper. Layer one third of spinach mixture on bottom of pan. Top with
  1/3 of roasted red pepper, 1/3 of the cheese and 1/3 of the crab.
  Pour about a third of the egg mixture over and gently tap pan and
  poke mixture to evenly distribute eggs. Continue layering in this way.
  
  Place terrine in a larger baking pan and pour enough hot tap water to
  come at least 2/3 of the way up the sides of the terrine. Place in a
  preheated 325 degree oven, cover with parchment or foil and bake in a
  preheated 325 degree oven until eggs are just set. Remove from water
  bath and let sit 15-20 minutes before unmolding if serving warm.

 Categories: Desserts, Dumplings, Holidays
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           -DIRECTIONS:
 
  Form pastry into ball; wrap in waxed paper; refrigerate. On waxed
  paper, combine 2 tablespoon sugar & the cinnamon. Pare and core
  apples; roll in cinnamon-sugar; reserve any left over. Preheat oven
  to 450 degrees. Butter 13-by-9-by-2-inch baking pan. On lightly
  floured pastry cloth, roll pastry into a rectangle 30 by 4-1/2
  inches. With pastry wheel or knife, cut lengthwise into 4 strips.
  Starting at the top, 1 inch from center, spiral a pastry strip around
  each apple, over- lapping slightly, covering completely. Moisten
  overlapping edges with cold water; press edges to seal. Press sides
  and bottoms of pastry against apples. Place in baking dish, sides not
  touching. Spoon melted butter into centers. Brush pastry with egg
  yolk mixed with 2 teaspoons water. Sprinkle with reserved
  cinnamon-sugar. Bake 15 minutes; reduce oven to 350 degrees. Brush
  pastry again with egg yolk. Continue baking dumplings 20 to 30
  minutes longer, or until apples are tender when pierced with knife
  and pastry is crisp and golden. Meanwhile, make cranberry-apple
  sauce: In medium saucepan, combine cranberries and sugar. Mash
  cranberries slightly with spoon. Add maple syrup and 1/4 cup water;
  mix well. Bring to boiling, stirring, about 3 minutes, or until
  cranberries pop. Add chopped apple and butter. Bring to boiling;
  reduce heat, and simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Remove apples to serving
  dish. Spoon sauce over top and around base of each. Serve warm with

      Title: BAKED DOUGHNUTS
 Categories: Desserts, Breads
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
      2 pk Dry yeast
    1/3 c  Warm water
  1 1/2 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      2 ts Nutmeg
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
  4 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Melted butter
      1 c  Sugar mixed w/1 tsp cinamon
 
  1. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl and let it
  dissolve for 5 minutes. Put the milk and shortening in a saucepan and
  heat until the shortening is melted. Cool to lukewarm.
  
  2. Pour the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the milk
  mix. Stif in the 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, eggs and 2 cups flour.
  Beat briskly until well blended. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour
  and beat until smooth. Cover the bowl and let double in bulk, about 1
  hour.
  
  3. Dust a board generously with flour and turn the dough mass onto
  it. This dough is soft and needs enough flour on the board to prevent
  sticking, but is easy to handle. Pat the dough into a round about 1/2
  inch thick. Use a 3 inch doughnut cutter and cut out the doughnuts,
  placing them (and the doughnut holes) on greased baking sheets, 1
  inch apart. These don't spread much; they rise. Preheat oven to 450F.
  Let the doughnuts rest and rise for 20 minutes uncovered. Bake about
  10 minutes or a little longer, until they have a touch of golden
  brown. Remove from the oven. Have ready the melted butter and a
  brush. On a sheet of wax paper, spread the cinnamon sugar. Brush each
  doughnut and doughnut hole with butter and roll in the cinnamon
  sugar. Serve hot.

MMMMM----------------------TO COMPLETE DISH---------------------------
      2 pk Frozen empanada dough (13oz)
           -20 5-inch disks
 
  Make the Bean Filling:  Coarsely mash the beans.  Stir in the onion,
  garlic, chilies, chili powder, cumin and vinegar.
  
  Make the Beef Filling: Saute the beef, onion, and garlic and a
  skillet over medium heat, breaking up the meat into small bits. Cook
  until the beef is browned and the vegetables are soft, about 5
  minutes. Drain off fat in a colander. Wipe out skillet with paper
  towels, and return the meat mixture to it, off the heat. Stir in the
  chilis, chili powder, cumin and salt to taste.
  
  Finish the dish: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place a disk of
  daugh on a work surface. Spoon 2 scant tablespoons of bean filling
  onto one half leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Top with 1
  tablespoon grated cheese if you like. Brush the edges of the dough
  with water. Fold the dough over the filling, forming a half circle.
  With the tines of a fork, press the edges together firmly, and poke a
  few holes, in the top to let the steam escape.  REpeat until you have
  used all the filling. Use the same procedure with the meat filling
  topping with 1 tablespoon salsa if you wish. Place the empanadas on a
  baking sheet, and coast them lightly with vegetable oil spray. Bake
  for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot or at room
  temperature.

  saucepan and cover it with a second plate, lid or foil. Put the fish
  on the pan when the water is boiling, then reduce the heat so water
  does not froth over. Cook the potatoes until tender-10-15 minutes if
  the chucks are faily small. Set the aside, without uncovering it.
  Drain and mash the potatoes, beating the well until smooth.  Mix in
  the butter, milk, lemon peel, parsley and anchovy extract, is used

  any cooking juices from the fish into the potato mixture. Flake the
  flash off the skin, discarded any bones, and at it to the potatoes.
  Mix well, adding seasoning to taste. Use a large spoon to place the
  fish mixture in a mound on the prepared dish or pan but do not
  flatten it until it is all in mounded up. Flatten the top of the
  mixture sightly, then sprinkle it with a little of the flour.  Use a
  spatula and slice to flatten the mixture into a little neat circle,
  about 7" across. Pat the sides with the knife and the top with slice
  to that the mixture is even and neatly shaped, keep sprinkling with
  the flour to coat the outside evenly. Trickle the oil over the fish
  cake and bake it for about 30 minutes, until well browned. Cut into
  wedges to serve.

      Title: BAKED GARLIC QUAIL
 Categories: Thai, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Quail
      4    Cloves garlic, crushed
      3 tb Sambal oelek
      2 tb Honey
      2 tb Light soy sauce
      2 ts Brown sugar
      2 tb Oil
 
  Wish I could show you all the picture of this dish. The quail are a
  gorgeous deep reddish orange in color. I imagine that this would be a
  great recipe to use on chicken wings. And they'd definitely be hot++
  check out the amount of sambal oelek, the Indonesian condiment made
  of crushed bird's eye chilies, garlic and vinegar. I'm making this
  tomorrow with a hacked up chicken and a double recipe of the
  marinade.  I'll start marinating it tonight.  It would probably be
  great with a game hen as well. Stay tuned++a report will follow.
  
  1:  Cut quail in half through centres.  Combine garlic, sambal oelek,
  honey, sauce, sugar and oil in bowl, add quail, stir well; cover,
  refrigerate overnight.
  
  2:  Just before serving, place quail on rack over baking dish, bake in
  moderate oven for 15 minutes, increase temperature to hot, cook
  further 10 minutes or until quail are crisp and tender.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
  
  Quail can be prepared 2 days ahead.
  
  Storage: Covered, in refrigerator. Freeze: Uncooked quail suitable.
  Microwave: Not suitable.

      1 tb Extra virgin olive oil
      1 tb Balsamic vinegar -- or
           Brandy
      1    Sprig fresh rosemary --
           (3-inch)
           SOUP:
      3 c  Vegetable broth
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Salt and pepper -- to taste
           HERB TOAST:

           Lengthwise
           Extra virgin olive oil
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1 tb Garlic chives -- minced
 
  Preheat the oven to 300F. Slice the top from the head of garlic and
  remove most of the papery outer skin from the head, but do not peel
  or separate into cloves. Place in a small ovenproof dish. Pour the
  olive oil over the top and add the vinegar and rosemary. \Cover with
  aluminum foil and bake until very tender, about 1 hour. Remove from
  the oven and let cool. NOTE - Prepare 1/2 loaf of whole wheat Italian
  bread: cut diagonally into 1/2 inch-thick slices. Preheat the oven to
  350F. Squeeze the softened garlic from the skins into a saucepan, and
  add the broth and wine. Heat to a simmer over medium-low heat and
  cook for 15 minutes. While cooking, make the herb toast. Bake the
  bread slices on a baking sheet until crisp but not golden, 6 to 8
  minutes. Rub the bread with the cut sides of the garlic clove, then
  brush generously with oil. Sprinkle on a thin layer of the Parmesan
  cheese and chives. Bake until the cheese is melted, another 5
  minutes. Serve immediately with the hot soup.
  
  Substitution for the Chinese garlic chives: 1 clove garlic and twice
  as much volumn of fresh chives.

  roasted garlic to flavor a broth. Serve with herb toast. Make extra!
  Garlic paste can be added to mashed potatoes, served with meats or
  vegetables, or simply spread on slices of toasted Italian bread.

      Title: BAKED GREEN TOMATOES
 Categories: Casseroles, Harned 1994, Kentucky, Southern, Vegetables
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
     15 lg Green tomatoes
           Salt and pepper
      2 c  Brown sugar
      3 c  Coarse butter-cracker crumbs
      2    Sticks butter
 
  Cut tomatoes in half and arrange in an oiled shallow casserole.
  Season with salt and pepper and spread each with a tablespoon of
  sugar. Cover with crumbs and dot with butter. Bake at 350 F until
  tender but still firm - the time will depend on the size and
  greenness of the tomatoes - but will probably range from 30 to
       40    minutes.
  
  Note: 1/2" slices may be baked in this same manner. Bake 25 minutes.

  halve and pit the peaches. Puree 2 of the peach halves in a food
  processor. Place the puree in a bowl and add the sugar, crushed

      Title: BAKED PEAMEAL BACON
 Categories: Canadian, Meats, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Peameal Bacon, 1 centre cut
           -piece
 
  "Peameal bacon is a unique Canadian meat, pickled but unsmoked loin
  of pork rolled in cornmeal. Usually it is sliced and fried for
  breakfast but it excellent baked whole. The cornmeal makes a crisp
  exterior and the meat, although quite lean, is particularly juicy,
  because of the pickling process. For baking it is important to select
  a piece from the centre cut, with a wide band of lean visible on both
  ends."
  
  Place in an open roasting pan, fat side up. Bake at 350F degrees for
  1- 1/2 hours. Serve hot in generous slices with baked beans if
  desired.

      1 c  Powdered sugar

      1 tb Coffee, rum, whisky,
           -brandy, or lemon juice
      1    Egg or
    1/4 c  Cream
 
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
   Beat butter until soft.  Gradually add the sugar and blend until
  creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time.
   In a bowl, combine raisins, currants, and pecans and sprinkle
  lightly with flour. Add these ingredients to the butter mixture.
   Combine breadcrumbs, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice; stir these
  ingredients into the butter mixture.  Bake in a greased tube pan or
  baking dish for about 1/2 hour. Serve with about 1 cup Hard Sauce.
  
  Hard Sauce:
  
  The basic ingredients of hard sauce are always the same, although
  proportions and flavoring may vary.  In this recipe, the larger
  amount of butter is preferable. An attractive way to serve hard sauce
  on cold cake or pudding is to chill it and mold it with a small fancy
  cutter--or put it through and individual butter mold.
  
   Sift the powdered sugar.
   Beat butter until soft; add sugar gradually.  Beat well until
  ingredients are well blended.
   Add the salt and flavoring.  Beat in the egg or cream. Continue to
  beat until sauce is very smooth. Chill thoroughly. Submitted By

  stirring almost constantly, until it is thick and pulls away from the
  sides of the pan, 20-25 minutes. Stir in the butter, 2 tbsp of the
  Parmesan and half the onions. Spread in a 3 cup gratin dish. Mix the
  bacon into the remaining onion mixture and spread on top of the
  polenta.  Sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan and bake in the middle

      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  Here's an old time idea that's probably "Mid-Western" enough for ya.
  This is something I picked up from my ex-Mennonite Grandmother in
  Hutchinson, Kasas.  Take four nice thick pork chops and brown 'em on
  each side. Dice up four or so slices of stale bread++or bread dried
  out in the oven. Mix that into a can or so of creamed corn. How many
  cans you need will vary with the brand of corn.  Add about half a
  chopped up yellow onion and a couple of beaten eggs.  Mix the mess
  well and add salt an pepper to taste. Put the browned chops in a
  greased baking dish, pour the corn mixture over the chops and pop 'em
  in a 325F oven for about an hour. The corn topping should come out
  browned and fairly dry and the chops should be nice and succulent
  with a hint of sweetness from the corn. This is one dish that garlic
  will absolutely ruin!  I've tried all sorts of ways to fancy up this
  dish but have never been successful in improving the original simple
  recipe. And there's not ONE squid tentacle in the whole mess! Posted

    1/2 c  Evaporated Milk; plus
      2 tb Evaporated Milk; (if needed)
      3 tb Unsalted Butter
      2 ts Sugar
    3/4 ts Salt
  2 1/2 ts Yeast
      3 c  Flour

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 md Idaho Potatoes; cut into
           -1/2" chunks
      1 c  Frozen Peas
      2 tb Oil
      2    Clove Garlic; finely chopped
      2 ts Fresh Ginger; finely chopped
      1 ts Dried Coriander
    1/2 ts Cumin
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      1    Egg; beaten with
      1 tb Water
 
  Place all dough ingredients in machine and program for knead and first
  rise. Press start. The dough will be quite firm but it should be moist
  enough to hold together. Make the filling while the dough is rising.
  Place the potato cubes in a small saucepan and cover with water.
  Bring to a boil over medium high heat, lower the heat to medium and
  continue cooking for 10 minutes, or until they have slightly softened
  but are not cooked through. Add the peas to the boiling water for the
  last minute of cooking. Drain the water from the potato cubes and
  peas.
  
  Heat the oil in a large frying pan set over medium high heat and add
  the onions, garlic and ginger. Saute until the onions are
  translucent. Add the potato cubes, peas, coriander, cumin, pepper and
  salt and stir until well mixed. Remove from the heat and cool
  slightly. Turn the finished dough out on a lightly floured surface
  and divide it into 8 equal balls. Let the balls rest 10 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350øF with the rack in the center position.
  Lightly spray a large baking sheet with vegetable cooking spray. On a
  lightly floured surface, roll each ball of dough to a 7" circle,
  rolling from the middle toward the edge. Distribute the filling
  evenly among the circles, about 3 heaping tb for each one. Lightly
  moisten the edge of each circle with water and fold over to form a
  semicircle. Press the edges together firmly. Fold the pressed edge
  inward toward the filling and press with you fingertips to seal. Lift
  the samosas onto the prepared baking sheet and generously brush the
  tops with the egg glaze. Bake the samosas for 15 minutes, or until
  they are a rich golden brown. Serve hot from the oven.

  :          Juice of 1 lemon (about 3
  :          tablespoons)
      1/2 c  walnuts -- finely chopped
  :          Freshly ground pepper
  
  Oven:  350=B0
  
  For the dough:
  
  In the workbowl of a food processor, combine the yeast, sugar and
  water, pulsing once. Spread 2 cups of the flour mixed with the salt
  and the baking soda over the yeast and place the workbowl cover on
  top. Let stand 15 minutes. With the machine running, slowly add the
  oil and then the yogurt. Process until smooth, about 20 seconds. Turn
  the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and
  springy in texture, about 5 minutes. Cover with a heavy kitchen towel
  and put in a warm place until dough rises, about
        1    hour.
  
  For the filling:
  
  Wash and stem the spinach. In a large colander, rub the spinach with
  1 1/2 tablespoons salt, let stand for at least 30 minutes. Squeeze
  the spinach to remove excess moisture; rinse to remove excess salt
  and chop finely. Squeeze the spinach until dry. Add the parsley,
  onion, allspice, sumac, lemon juice, olive oil, nuts and pepper to
  taste. Correct the seasoning.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350=B0. Divide the dough into nine equal parts.
  On a lightly floured work surface, roll each part into a smooth round
  and allow to rest for 10 minutes, then roll each part into a 5-inch
  round. Place an equal amount of filling in the shape of a long
  triangle in the center of each round. Fold two sides in toward the
  center, and the remaining short side down to form a triangle. Crimp
  the seams with fingertips. Bake on a non-stick pan until golden
  brown, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, set the pan on a rack,
  cover with a damp towel and let stand
       10    minutes. Serve hot or cold.

      Title: BAKED SQUASH
 Categories: Low, Fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 pk Frozen squash, thrawed (6
           Cups)
    1/2 c  Toasted oat bran
    1/2 c  Maple syrup
      1 c  Nonfat dry buttermilk (or
           Nonfat dry milk or the vegan
           Equivalent)
      1 tb Grated fresh orange peel
  1 1/2 ts Pumpkin pie seasoning
 
  Mix together oat bran, dry milk, orange peel, and seasoning. Wisk in
  squash and syrup. Bake at 350 degrees in a large rectangular pan (I
  use glass) for about an hour. Serve hot or cold.
  
  Notes: 1. I buy oat bran in bulk. Toast it at 350 degrees on a cookie
  sheet with edges. Stir every 10 minutes until light brown. I add the
  orange peel at this point and store it in the refrigerator. Do not
  add the orange peel before toasting, it burns. Already grated orange
  peel is available but the fresh tastes better.
  
  2. I have made this with many different kinds of squash and or sweet
  potatoes.  They are all good.  The frozen squash is just the easiest.
  
  3. Original recipe calls for cinnamon, I like the taste with the
  pumpkin pie spice but I've used others. I did not like plain clove.

  20 minutes to allow the salt to draw out the eggplant's bitter
  juices. Pat the eggplant dry with paper towels.
  
  Dice the pulp of the eggplant and put it in a bowl with the tomatoes,
  mozzarella, basil, parsley, garlic, and olive oil. Season with salt
  and pepper flakes. Fill the eggplant's cavities with this mixture.
  
  Oil a baking dish lightly, and put the eggplant halves into the dish.
  Bake until they are lightly golden, soft to the touvh, and easily
  pierced with the tip of a thin knife, 15 to 25 minutes, depending on
  the size of the eggplants.  Serve hot or at room temperature.
  
  NOTES:
  
  This is from Biba Caggiano's _Trattoria Cooking_ cookbook. It is easy
  to do and can be doubled and frozen for an additional meal later on.
  
  One of Biba's notes is that she will dice any leftover eggplant and
  toss it quickly in a skillet with extra virgin olive oil and freshly
  diced tomatoes and serve it over penne, shells, or rigatoni.

      Title: BAKED STUFFED EGGPLANT MIKE ELIA
 Categories: Eggplant
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg (1-1/4 pounds) eggplant
      3 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese
      3 ea Eggs, lightly beaten
      2 tb Minced parsley
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 tb Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons
           -for drizzling on top
      1 lb Canned plum tomatoes and
           -juice
  2 1/2 c  Water
      6 ea Ounces (1 medium)
           -all-purpose or Idaho potato
      1 ea Clove garlic, minced
    1/4 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
  1 1/2 tb Parmesan cheese
 
  1. Do not peel the eggplant.  Slice off the green cap and cut the
  eggplant in half lengthwise.  Use a sharp knife to score the meat
  into 1/2-inch cubes, leaving 1/2-inch rim around the edge. Scoop out
  the flesh with a spoon and coarsely chop it.
  
  2.  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet.  Add the eggplant cubes
  and the onion to the skillet and saute over low heat, stirring
  frequently, until the eggplant is softened and lightly browned, about
  8 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the bread
  crubms, Parmesan cheese, eggs, and parsley. Season with the salt and
  black pepper.
  
  3.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).
  
  4.  Sprinkle the eggplant shells lightly with salt and pepper and
  divide the stuffing between them. [The recipe may be made ahead up to
  this point and wrapped and refrigerated for up to 3 hours.]
  
  5.  To make the Potato-Tomato Sauce, coat the bottom of a 7-by-11 inch
  baking dish with the 2 Tablespoons olive oil. Pour the can of
  tomatoes into the baking dish and cut them into quarters with a sharp
  knife or the side of a spoon.  Add the water to the pan.  Peel the
  potato and cut it into thin (no more than 1/4-inch thick) slices.
  Stack the slices, cut them into 1/4-inch strips, and cut the strips
  into small cubes. Add them to the tomato mixture in the baking dish,
  along with the garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper.  Set the stuffed
  eggplant shells on top of the tomato mixture. Sprinkle the Parmesan
  cheese over the tops of the eggplant and into the sauce, and spoon a
  few pieces of tomato from the sauce onto the tops of the eggplant to
  help keep it moist.  Drizzle a teaspoon or two of olive oil over the
  tops of the eggplant. 6. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until
  the potatoes are tender and the tops of the eggplant are lightly
  browned, about 1 to 1-1/4 hours.  The sauce will reduce quite a bit
  as it cooks.  Cut each stuffed eggplant in half, and serve one piece
  each with some sauce spooned over it.

  then stuff it and sew up or skewer the opening.
    Place in a buttered pan and lay lemon slices along its length.
  Stick a toothpick in each slice.

      Title: BAKED STUFFED POTATOES - INDIA
 Categories: Vegetables, East/orient
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 md Baking potatoes
      1 c  Chopped onion
    3/4 c  Diced carrots
      2 tb Veg. oil
    3/4 c  Red/green bell pepper,chop
      1 ts Ground coriander seeds
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/8 ts Ground cardamom (optional)
      1 pn Ground cloves
      4 oz Cream cheese, room temp
           Salt
           Fresh ground black pepper
           Spicy Yogart Sauce -
           [seperate recipe]
 
  Scrub the potatoes and bake them in a 400 F. oven for
        1    hour or until done.
  
  While the potatoes are baking, prepare the filling. Saute the onions
  and carrots in the oil until they are tender, for about 10 minutes.
  Add the bell pepper and spices and continue to saute for another
  minute or two, stirring. Add a little water to the pan to prevent
  sticking, cover it, and cook for another 5 minutes, or until the bell
  pepper is just tender. Stir in the cream cheese and add salt and
  pepper to taste. Set aside.
  
  When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, make a lengthwise cut in
  the top of each one and scoop out at least half of the contents. If
  you are using large potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise and scoop
  them out, leaving about 1/2 inch of potato clining to the skin. Mash
  the scooped-out potato and then add it to the vegetable-cream cheese
  mixture. Lower the oven heat to 350 F. Fill the potato shells with
  this mixture and place them in an oiled baking dish. Cover with foil
  and bake for 20 minutes.
  
  Serve topped with Spicy Yogurt Sauce. Baked Stuffed Potatoes served
  with Dal and your favorite chutney make a complete meal. Note: this
  dish can be prepared ahead. After stuffing the potatoes, wrap them
  well and refrigerate for up to two days. When ready to serve, bake
  them in a 350 F. oven for about 45 minutes.

      6    Slices bread (white)
      2 tb Butter

           -Tabasco sauce
 
         Saute minced celery in butter over low heat. Add chopped
       tomato, Tabasco sauce, parsley, thyme, salt, sage and bread
       which was soaked in cold water, then squeezed dry. Blend all in
       skillet, then stuff into fish cavity. Skewer opening closed.
       Bake, uncovered, in preheated oven set at 350 degrees, basting
       often with sauce. Allow about 10 minutes baking time per pound

 Categories: Greek, Seafood
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 lb Squid
           Salt
      6 tb Olive oil
      1    Onion; chopped
    1/3 c  Raw long-grain white rice
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint leaves
      2 tb White wine
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
    1/4 c  Black raisins
           Freshly ground pepper
      4    Peeled tomatoes; drained
    1/3 c  White wine
 
  Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs from the heads and
  tentacles, removing and discarding the translucent cartilage, and
  small sand bag and ink. Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them
  inside and out with cold water.  Heads and tentacles should be rinsed
  thoroughly and cooked along with the sacs after you stuff the latter.
  Drain and set aside.
  
  Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a heavy frying pan, then add the onion and
  cook, without browning, until transparent. Stir in the rice and saute
  a few minutes, until golden.  Blend in the parsley, mint, 2
  tablespoons wine, pine nuts, and raisins, and season with salt and
  pepper to taste. Add enough water to half cover and cook for a few
  minutes, then stuff the squid sacs with the mixture using a very
  small spoon and allowing enough liquid in each for the rice to cook.
  Seal opening with skewers or toothpicks. Place the stuffed sacs with
  the heads and tentacles in a baking-serving dish.  Sprinkle with salt
  and pepper and set aside.
  
  Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes, 1/3 cup wine, and a little salt and
  pepper in a small saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour the sauce
  over the squid and dribble the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over
  the top. Bake in a medium-slow oven (300 F) for 1 1/2 hours or until
  the squid and rice are tender and the sauce has thickened. Serve warm
  or cold.

      1 ts Whole allspice
      3    Star anise pods, broken up
    1/2 ts Whole peppercorns
      2 sm Dried chiles, any loose
           -seeds removed
      2    Tilapia, cleaned and scaled
           -(2 1/2 to 3 pounds in all)
           Salt
      3 tb White wine
    1/2 c  Fish or poultry stock
      1 tb Butter (optional)
 
  This will work with other whole lean fish, including small rockfish or
  farmed striped bass, and cuts or 'roasts' of halibut or pink salmon.
  Adjust the cooking time according to the thickness and density of the
  fish.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
  
  Rub a baking dish well with the oil, add the vegetables and whole
  spices, and toss to coat them lightly with oil.
  
  Arrange in an even layer. Rinse the fish well inside and out, pat dry,
  season lightly with salt, and place on top of the vegetables.
  
  Add the wine and 3 tablespoons of the stock. Make a loose tent of
  foil over the tail of the fish and place in the oven.
  
  Bake, rotating the pan once halfway through the cooking time, until a
  skewer easily enters the thickest part of the fish, 25 to 30 minutes.
  
  If you have an instant-reading thermometer, it should read 145
  degrees F.to 150 degrees F.in the center near the bone. Transfer the
  fish to a warm serving platter.
  
  Strain the contents of the baking dish into a small saucepan; discard
  the spices and vegetables. Add the remaining stock, bring to a boil
  and reduce by a third. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.
  Swirl in the butter if desired and pour over and around the fish on
  the platter.

 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------BRINE--------------------------------
      2 tb Salt
      1 ts Cayenne
           Juice of 1 lime
      2 c  Water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
     12    Stale corn tortillas
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a medium saucepan, mix the brine
  ingredients, warm over a low heat and whisk thoroughly. Cut the stale
  tortillas into strips or wedges. (If the tortillas are fresh, dry
  them by spreading them on a baking sheet and letting them sit out,
  room temperature, for 1 hour or more.) Briefly dip the tortilla
  pieces into the brine, then shake off the excess water. (A longer
  soaking in the brine will make the tortillas take on a more
  pronounced flavor.) Spread the prepared tortilla chips in a single
  layer on a baking sheet. Bake, turning occasionally, until they are
  crisp and golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.

      Title: BAKED TROUT WITH YOGHURT & HERBS
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    6-8 oz trouts
  7 1/2 fl Greek strained yoghurt
  2 1/2 fl Whipping cream
      2 tb Fresh chopped parsley
      2 tb Chopped chives
      2 tb Chopped fennel
      1 ts Fresh chopped thyme
      1 ts Fresh chopped oregano
      1 ts Fresh chopped tarragon
           Clarified or unsalted butter
 
  Choose a baking dish or other shallow oven-proof dish suitable for
  bringing to table, which is just large enough to take the trout in a
  single layer when they are arranged head to tail. Thoroughly dry the
  fish with plenty of kitchen paper.  Make a frying pan very hot,
  barely smear it with fat and fry the fish briefly, one or two at a
  time, just long enough to brown their skins well on both sides.
  Transfer the fish to the ovenproof dish, arranging them neatly. Cover
  and store in a cool place.
  
  Chop the herbs and mix them gently in a small saucepan. Measure the
  yoghurt and cream and pour them over the herbs. Add plenty of pepper
  and some salt and stir to mix well.  Cover and leave to infuse.
  Everything up to this stage can be done in advance, but be sure to
  bring both the pan of sauce and the dish of trout back to room
  temperature about 1 hour before they are to be put back into the oven
  for cooking. (Foods that are transferred straight from the fridge to
  cooker take a very long time to heat through properly.)
  
  About 1/2 hour before you plan to serve the trout, bring the
  yoghurt-and- herb mixture very slowly to simmering point, stirring
  all the while. Pour the aromatic mixture over the fish, cover the
  dish and bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for 20-25 minutes until the
  fish are piping hot and cooked through.  (To check a trout for
  readiness, insert the tip of a knife into its flesh just behind the
  head.)  Serve with steamed new potatoes and other young summer
  vegetables such as carrots and peas.

      Title: BAKED~ PRESSED TOFU
 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Tofu
    1/2 c  Flour
        x  Favorite spices
 
  From: dcross@pts.mot.com (Daniel Cross X8663 P5108). About the
  quickest tofu recipe I know is this one: Mix some flour (about .5
  cup) with your favorite spices (I like cayenne). Press most of the
  water out of a block of tofu with a towel, then slice it up any old
  way. Dip the slices in soy sauce, then in the flour/spice mix, and
  place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-30 minutes (a toaster-oven is
  great for this). If you like them browned a little more, put them
  under the broiler for 5 min. before serving.
  
  From: samv@netcom.com (Sam Voeller).  sort of a boring tofu user
  myself, but one recipe I have is so yummy I use it in all sorts of
  things. Preheat oven to 350 degrees (f) cut tofu (firm) into 1" cubes
  dip cubed tofu in soy sauce, and dust on all sides with fresh-ground
  black pepper set on lightly oiled (or non-stick) baking sheet and
  bake for 30 minutes, turning once so that all sides are browned
  evenly. This gives the tofu some real, chewable texture, as well as a
  spicey zing. I use these tofu chunks in thick stews, or just over
  steamed veggies.

      Title: BAKER'S CRAFT DOUGH
 Categories: Household, Better
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------
      4 c  Flour
      1 c  Salt
  1 1/2 c  Water

MMMMM--------------------OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS-------------------------
      1 tb Powdered alum
      1 tb Cooking oil
    1/4 ts Food coloring
    1/4 ts Oil of cloves or peppermint
           -extract

MMMMM-----------------------FOR FINISHING----------------------------
           Acrylic paints
           Spray acrylic fixative
           Clear or orange shellac
 
  ** Pliable and simple to make and use. Powdered alum retards spoilage
  and cooking oil makes dough a little easier to work with.
  
  Mix together flour, salt, and alum if you are using it. With a big
  wooden spoon, slowly stir in the water, oil, coloring, and scent.
  Keep mixing until dough follows the spoon around the bowl and
  thenknead with your hands until smooth. The initial kneading will
  only take a minute or two to get the dough going and to make it
  pliable. After that, you will knead as you work with smaller pieces
  and the dough will stay soft. Store dough in the refrigerator until
  ready to use. It will remain in good condition for up to 4 wks. Let
  it warm to room temp before using.
  
  To Use: Generously flour work surface and pinch off just enough dough
  to mold with. Leave the rest in a plastic bag until needed. Fill a sm
  bowl with water to use as glue when you want to stick 2 pieces
  together. When you have made an item you want to keep, place it on a
  floured cookie sheet. Bake 250F, at least 1 hr. Baking time varies
  considerably depending on the thickness of the object. It's a good
  idea to check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the thickest
  part of the item. If you think your ornaments are getting too brown,
  cover them with foil, turn down the oven and compensate by cooking a
  bit longer. After the item is completely dry, you can paint it with
  ascrylic paints and then either paint it wiht shellac or spray it
  with several coats of acrylic fixative.
  
  Ideas: Successfully used for homey-looking Christmas ornaments. Do
  children's hand-prints. 1/2" thick layer of dough. Force dough
  through a garlic press for a bird's nest, hair, animal fur,
  spaghetti. Just remember to glue the strand together as you go with
  water. Add teeny little eggs to a nest or roll out meatballs for a
  bowl of spaghetti. Make a bread basket, bagel, or pretend muffins.
  Bread basket: Roll out and cut thick strips of dough. Drape several,
  close together across an inverted, heavily floured loaf pan or baking
  dish. Weave strips in the opposite direction through the original
  ones. Create a lattice work design and finish off edges as if you
  were creating a fancy pie. Bake your creation, pan and all, in the
  oven and lift the baske off the pan when it is completely cool.
  
  Hints: To add a hanger to Christmas ornaments: Push a paper clip
  almost all athe way into the top of the ornament. To create a hole
  for threading a pendant, take a cocktail straw and carefully drill
  out the hole just before you are ready to bake. 40 oz
  
  Big savings. Comparison is to modeling clay. No good for ornaments;
  they puff when baked. Typed by Sherilyn Schamber

      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      4 c  Flour
      1 c  Salt
  1 1/2 c  Water
 
    SOURCE:  Lynne Sammon - posted on Delphi Cust 229 board on 7/26/95.
  MM format by Ursula R. Taylor.
    Mix together into a stiff dough.  Knead 5 minutes. Roll out dough
  to 1/4" thickness and cut into shapes with cookie cutters. Place on
  cookie sheets. Bake in a 350~ oven for 1 hour or until hard when
  tapped with a fork. The "cookie" shuld ping.
    Can be decorated with water color or poster paint and coat with
  varnish, spray lacquer or plastic.  This will prevent there getting
  soft and spoiled.  DO NOT DOUBLE MIXTURE AND USE WITHIN 4 HOURS AFTER
  MIXING.
    Personal Note from Ursula Taylor - folks Lynne didn't say - but I
  would think that if you're going to use these "cookies" as ornaments
  be sure to put a hole in the top of them before baking them.

 Categories: Desserts, British
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Solid vegetable shortening
      1 ts Salt (optional)
    1/4 c  Ice water

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      3    Medium sized eggs, at room
           Temperature
    1/2 c  Superfine sugar
    1/2 c  Butter at room temperature
    3/4 c  Ground almonds
      2 tb (Heaping) good-quality
           Strawberry preserves
 
  PASTRY: Measure out the flour and put to one side.  In a large mixing
  bowl, place the fat, water and 3 heaped tablespoons of the flour you
  set to one side. Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until all is
  well blended. The carefully add in the rest of the flour, rubbing the
  mixture between your fingertips until it all sticks together. You can
  add up to 2 tablespoons of water to help, but no more. Remember that
  if you overwork the pastry at this stage it will become tough and
  shrink when cooked. Combine into a ball, cover with a damp tea towel
  and place in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 400F.  Beat the
  eggs and sugar together until creamy (this takes about 3 minutes).
  Add the butter in small pieces, and the almonds, and continue to beat
  for another minute until all is combined. Set aside. On a lightly
  floured working surface, roll out the pastry into a circle so that
  it's 3 inches larger than the baking tin, and about 1/8" thick.
  Lightly grease the tin, making sure you smear a very thin film all
  over the inside.  Now transfer the pastry to the bin by carefully
  rolling it around the rolling pin.  Be careful, it's not always easy;
  but if the pastry breaks a bit, don't worry - you can do a repair job
  when it's in the tin. Now with your hands fashion it to the inside of
  the tin, making sure it reaches inside the corners.  Cut off the
  excess pastry with a knife. You will hae pastry left over; roll it
  into a ball and freeze for next time. In a small saucepan gently melt
  the jam so it will spread more easily. Distribute the jam evenly over
  the pastry in the tin and then cover the preserve with the egg
  mixture. Now bake in the center of your oven for 25-30 minutes.  It's
  done when the filling has set and is a mid to deep brown all over.
  If it starts to brown on one side and not the other, turn the pie
  halfway through cooking (do this quickly or all the heat will
  escape).  This means that you'll have to keep an eye on it while it's
  in the oven. You can serve this with whipped heavy cream - it tastes
  not unlike pumpkin pie, but with an almond flavor.

      8 oz Shortcrust pastry
           FILLING
           Raspberry or
           Strawberry jam
      4 oz Margarine
      4 oz Caster sugar
      4 oz Ground almonds
      2    Eggs, well beaten
           Few drops almond essence
 
  Set oven to 375/F or Mark 5. Line a shallow pie dish with pastry and
  spread with a layer of jam. Mix all the other ingredients together
  and spread over the jam. Bake for 20-30 minutes until the fllling is
  set. This version of the Bakewell Pudding is often preferred both for
  its flavour and texture. The use of ground almonds makes the filling
  firmer. Another variation of this recipe uses 2 oz. self- raising
  flour and 2 oz. ground rice instead of the ground almonds.

      Title: BAKING POWDER~ MAKING YOUR OWN
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Cook's Illustrated 5/6/93
      1 ts Baking soda -- (an
           Alkaline)
      2 ts Cream of tartar -- (an
           Acid)
           For each tablespoon of
           Baking powder called for
 
  Unlike baking soda, which keeps forever, baking powder begins to
  react and lose its potency the instant you open the can and expose
  the contents to humidity in the air. For maximum leavening power, I
  recommend buying baking powder in the smallest can available, dating
  the can when opened, and discarding the contents after three months.
  The alternative, uncommon but hardly daunting, is to make your own
  baking powder. Simply combine one teaspoon of baking soda (an
  alkaline) and two teaspoons of cream of tartar (an acid) for each
  tablespoon of baking powder called for. This substitution works very
  well for biscuits.

      Title: BAKING TECHNIQUES
 Categories: Info, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  Baking is probably the most common cooking method, but not
  necessarily the first thing you think of for cooking fish. It is a
  good choice though because it offers a wealth of variety. And you can
  bake fish with very little or no added fat. Unlike the moist heat of
  steaming or poaching, oven heat is dry, so your most important
  consideration is that the fish remains moist while cooking.
  
  There are many ways to do this beginning with an even coating of
  seasoned breadcrumbs or a quick brush with olive oil or melted
  butter. You can top the fish with thinly sliced tomatoes, zucchini,
  mushrooms or other vegetables, which help maintain the moisture in
  the fish as it cooks. You can even oven-poach fish by cooking it
  either partially or totally submerged in fish stock, wine or other
  liquid, covering the baking dish with foil, or laying buttered foil
  directly on top of the fish pieces. Wrapping the fish, in lettuce
  leaves, parchment paper or foil, is probably the best way to keep
  fish moist as it bakes. This in fact becomes oven-steaming because
  the moisture is sealed in.
  
  Baking is so versatile that virtually any fish or shellfish can be
  baked, from the thinnest fillets to oysters on the half-shell to the
  largest whole fish that your oven can accommodate. Smaller fillets or
  fish pieces should be baked at higher temperatures (about 425øF) to
  cook more quickly so there is less chance of drying out. Large pieces
  of fish and whole fish should be cooked at moderate temperatures
  (about 350øF) so the heat can penetrate to the interior of the fish
  without overcooking the exterior.
  
                                   How to Bake
  
  1. Preheat the oven. Arrange the fish in an even layer in a lightly
  oiled or buttered baking dish, folding thin ends under if necessary
  to encourage even cooking.
  
  2. Sprinkle the fish with the seasoning, coating, vegetables or
  whatever is called for in your recipe.
  
  3. Bake the fish in the preheated oven until it is opaque through the
  thickest part of the fish. Cooking time will vary depending on the
  thickness of the fish and the accompanying ingredients.
  
  4. Transfer the fish and vegetables, if appropriate, to individual
  plates. If there are any cooking juices remaining in the dish, spoon
  a little over the fish and serve.

 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
  4 1/2 c  Walnuts (16 oz), chop fine
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 lb Phyllo sheets
      1 c  Unsalted butter, melted
      1 c  Honey
 
  Grease 13" by 9" baking pan. In large bowl, mix walnuts, sugar and
  cinnamon, set aside. In baking pan, place 1 sheet of phyllo, allowing
  it to extend up sides of pan; brush with butter or margarine. Repeat
  to make 5 more layers; sprinkle with 1 cup walnut mixture. Cut
  remaining phyllos into approximately 13" by 9" rectangles if desired;
  otherwise, just be sure to butter the edges so you can fold them over
  after you add the filling. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place one
  phyllo rectangle in pan; brush with butter or margarine. Repeat to
  make at least 6 layers, overlapping small strips of phyllo to make
  rectangels, if necessary. Sprinkle with 1 cup of the walnut mixture.
  Repeat step 3 three more times. Place remaining phyllo on top of last
  walnut layer. Trim any phyllo that extends over top of pan. With
  sharp knife, cut just halfway through all layers in a diamond pattern
  to make 24 servings. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until top is golden brown.
  Meanwhile, in 1-quart saucepan over medium hear, heat honey until
  hot, not boiling. Spoon hot honey evenly over baklava. Cool in pan on
  wire rack at least 1 hour, then cover and leave at room temperature
  until serving time. To serve: Finish cutting through layers.

  3 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
  2 1/2 c  Water
      2 tb Honey
      1 ea Lemon rind
      1 ea Stick cinnamon
      4 ea Whole cloves
  1 1/4 lb Walnuts & blanched almonds*
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Ground cloves
  1 1/2 lb Commercial filo sheets
      1 lb Sweet butter, melted
 
  *Note- Walnuts and almonds should be chopped medium fine. Combine 3
  cups sugar, the water, honey, whole lemon rind, and whole spices in a
  saucepan and bring to boil.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15
  minutes, then remove the lemon peel and spices and cool. Meanwhile,
  in a large bowl, combine the nuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and
  ground spices and set aside. Lay filo sheets flat, cover with waxed
  paper and then a damp towel. Keep covered except when removing to
  assemble the baklava. Count 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and
  refrigerate to reserve for the top. Using a large pastry brush,
  butter an 11 1/2-inch by 15 1/2-inch by 3-inch baking pan. Lay a filo
  sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush with warm butter, and repeat
  using 8 sheets.  Scoop up a handful of the nut-spice mixture and
  sprinkle over the top filo sheet inside the pan. Lay on 3 or more
  filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle again with the
  nut mixture. Continue until all the nuts and filo are used. (The
  important things here are to butter each filo and spread the nuts
  evenly. The way to do the latter is to rotate the pan several times
  during the procedure.) Now you can remove the reserved sheets from
  the refrigerator and spread over the top, brushing on each sheet.
  Using a long, very sharp knife, score the baklava from top to bottom
  into diamond shapes planning in advance the size desired.  Be sure
  the knife touches the bottom of the pan as you cut.  Heat the
  remaining butter to sizzling and pour over the top.  Bake in a 300
  degree oven for 1 1/4 hours or until golden chestnut in color and
  flaky.  Remove from the oven (in the pan) to a rack, and spoon the
  cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in the pan, then serve each
  piece individually. Source: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras

      Title: BAKLAVA (LAYERED PASTRY WITH WALNUTS & HONEY SYRUP)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 1 9x13 tray
 
           PASTRY:
    3/4 lb Butter; three 1/4 lb. sticks
           ;cut into 1/4 inch pieces
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
     40    Filo sheets; each about 16
           ;inches long by 12 inches
           ;wide
      4 c  Walnuts, shelled; pulverized
           ;in a blender, nut grinder
           ;or mortar/pestle
           SYRUP:
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Water
      1 tb Lemon juice, fresh
      1 tb Honey
 
    Clarify the butter in a heavy saucepan or skillet in the following
  fashion:  Melt the butter slowly over low heat without letting it
  brown, skimming off the foam as it rises to the surface.  Remove the
  pan from the heat, let it rest for 2 or 3 minutes, then spoon off the
  clear butter and discard the milky solids at the bottom of the pan.
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and stir the vegetable oil into the
  clarified butter.  Using a pastry brush coat the bottom and sides of
  a 13 by 19 by 2   inch baking dish with about 1 tablespoon of the
  mixture. Fold a sheet of filo in half crosswise, lift it up gently
  and unfold it into the prepared dish.  Press the pastry flat, fold
  down the excess around the sides and flatten it against the bottom.
  Brush the entire surface of the pastry lightly with the butter and
  oil mixture, and lay another sheet of filo on top, folding it down
  and buttering it in a similar fashion. Sprinkle the pastry evenly
  with about 3 tablespoons of walnuts. Repeat the same procedure using
  two sheets of buttered filo and 3 tablespoons of the pulverized
  walnuts each time to make 19 layers in all. Spread the 2 remaining
  sheets of filo on top and brush the baklava with all of the remaining
  butter and oil mixture. With a small, sharp knife score the top of
  the pastry with parallel diagonal lines about   inch deep and 2
  inches apart, then cross them diagonally to form diamond shapes.
  Bake in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes.  Reduce the heat to
  about 300 and bake for 45 minutes longer, or until the top is crisp
  and golden brown.
  
  Syrup:
    Meanwhile, make the syrup.  Combine the sugar, water and lemon
  juice in a small saucepan and, stirring constantly, cook over
  moderate heat until the sugar dissolves.  Increase the heat to high
  and, timing it from the moment the sugar boils, cook briskly,
  uncovered, for about 5 minutes, or until the syrup reaches a
  temperature of 220 on a candy thermometer. Remove the pan from the
  heat and stir in the honey. Pour the syrup into a bowl or pitcher and
  set aside. When the baklava is done, remove it from the oven and pour
  the syrup over it.  Cool to room temperature, and just before
  serving, cut the baklava into diamond shaped serving pieces.

  Lay the fillo dough out on a table.  Fillo dough will dry quickly, so
  you'll need to work fast, so what spills out of the pan doesn't dry
  (although it will anyway), and keep a damp towel on the rest of it
  (that you had laid on the table) so it doesn't dry.
  
  On a medium-sized, buttered pan (you'll need to melt the butter) lay
  one of the sheets of dough.  Butter it, and lay another on top of
  that. Continue until you have 5-6 sheets of dough on the bottom of
  the pan. Then lay another sheet, and do NOT butter it.  On that, put
  some of the almond mix, enough to cover it evenly, but not making a
  thick layer. On that, lay another sheet of dough, butter it, and then
  another, unbuttered. On that place some almond mix again. Repeat
  until all the mix is gone, or you have only 4-5 sheets of dough left.
  
  Fold in the dough that hangs from the side of the pan. Some of sthem
  will be dry, so just cut them and discard them. Make sure to butter
  all of them (except, of course, if they have almonds on them). Lay
  down some more sheets of dough, buttering every one, and cutting off
  the edges, that hang from the sides of the pan. here, I've found it
  easier if you just lay the dough down, width of dough to length of
  pan. That is to say, the width of the dough is sometimes about teh
  same size as the length of the pan, and the length of the dough about
  twice teh widht of the pan, so lay the short side of the dough down
  along the length of the pan, so that some (about half) of it will
  hang out the end. Then butter it, and fold what hangs back in the
  pan, buttering that.  This way you get it to look better, and stick
  better.
  
  When you're done with laying the sheets of dough down, make sure you
  butter the first one VERY well, and sprinkle some water on it before
  you put it in the oven. Also, with a sharp, pointy knife, cut the top
  few sheets of dough, not getting all the way through, just sort of
  "scratching" the top layer and marking the pieces, in rhombus-shaped
  pieces. I find it easier to cut along lengthwise, and then sideways,
  from corner to corner, and lines paralel to that: Converted by MMCONV

      Title: BAKLAVA 3
 Categories: Greek
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -=======
 
  Ingredients:
  
  Syrup:
  
  1.5 cups  sugar 0.5 cup water 1 tblsp mazaher (orange blossom water)
  squeeze   of lemon
  
  Baklava:
  
  1 box     phillo dough 3 cups chopped walnuts 1 tblsp cinnamon 2 tblsp
  mazaher 2 sticks melted unsalted butter honey 1. Cook syrup first so
  that, if you mess up the syrup, you can make another batch.
  
  Combine all syrup ingredients and cook over medium heat and after it
  has come to a boil cook for 5 minutes and remove from the heat. Do
  not let it get too thick when it's still cooking or it won't be
  absorbed by the phillo dough.  Place syrup in the refridgerator.
  
  2.  For the walnut mix - mix walnuts, mazaher and honey. Mix honey in
  so that the walnuts stick together but are not dripping.
  
  3.  Using a pastry brush, put a coat of butter on cookie sheet.
  Carefully place 1 sheet of phillo on top of butter. Brush sheet with
  butter then put another sheet on top of that one. Continue until
  you've used 1/3 of the phillo.
  
  4.  Spread the walnut mixture on the phillo, leaving a tiny bit of
  space at the edges.  Cover with the rest of the phillo, spreading
  butter between each sheet.
  
  5.  Make sure the top of the baklava has butter spread all over it.
  Then. cut the baklava in squares.
  
  6.  Place in oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes ~ but watch it
  closely.
  
  7.  When the Baklava is done cooking pour the syrup on top - a little
  at a time using a spoon or ladle.
  
  The thing to remember about the syrup is hot baklava/cold syrup or
  cold baklava/hot syrup.  You want the maximum amount of syrup to be
  absorbed.

      Title: BAKLAVA ROLLS
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Walnuts, finely chopped
  2 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground Cloves
           Syrup:
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1    Cinnamon Stick
      2 ts Lemon Juice
    1/2 c  Honey
      1 lb Phyllo Dough
    3/4 lb Unsalted Butter, melted
 
  Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix first four ingredients together for
  filling. Combine syrup ingredients and cook until sugar dissolves and
  mixture turns syrupy. Set aside to cool. Remove cinnamon stick before
  using.
  
  To Assemble:
  
  Unfold phyllo. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut phyllo sheets
  crosswise, into thirds. Cover phyllo not being used with a barely
  damp towel. Using two pieces of phyllo - phyllo sheets are so thin
  they must be doubled - and keeping narrow ends towards you, brush
  with butter. Place 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons filling 1/4 inch from end
  nearest you, to within 1/4 inch of sides. Fold long sides in 1/4
  inch. Fold over bottom to cover filling.
  
  Place a clean pencil on top of fold and roll into a cigar-like
  cylinder.
  
  Push both ends toward center and remove pencil. Place roll on cookie
  sheet and generously brush with butter. Repeat with remaining filling
  and phyllo.
  
  Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Dip hot rolls into cooled
  syrup - kitchen tongs work well for this. Place onto a platter to
  cool. Cover and refrigerate. Can be frozen.

      4 c  Granulated sugar
      4 c  Water
      1 c  Honey
           Lemon juice to taste

MMMMM--------------------------BAKLAVA-------------------------------
      1 lb Toasted blanched almonds *
    1/2 c  Zwieback crumbs
      4 tb Granulated sugar
      1 ds Cinnamon
      1 lb Phyllo pastry sheets
  1 1/2 c  Sweet butter; melted
 
  *Note: Either toasted blanched almonds, or walnut meats, or half of
  each, (finely chopped) may be used.
  
  Cooky Filling:  Cream the 2 cups sweet butter until light. Gradually
  beat in the confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until mixture
  is fluffy. Add egg yolk and vanilla or almond extract and blend well.
  Work in about 4 cups flour to make a medium-soft dough.  Set aside
  and make syrup.
  
  Syrup:  In a saucepan combine the granulated sugar and water. Bring
  to a boil and boil for 15 minutes or until syrup is slightly thick.
  Add honey and again bring to the boiling point. Add lemon juice to
  taste, and cool.
  
  Mix almonds or walnuts, or a combination of the two, with zwieback, 4
  T granulated sugar, and cinnamon. Brush 2 sheets of phyllo pastry
  evenly with butter and sprinkle with nut mixture. Place 2 buttered
  sheets of phyllo on top and sprinkle with nut mixture.  Shape a
  portion of cooky filling into a 1/2-inch-thick roll and place the
  roll along one edge of the pastry sheets. Roll up loosely, cut into
  2-inch slices, and place slices in a buttered cake pan.  (Continue in
  this method until all phyllo pastry and/or cooky filling is used.)
  Brush tops of each slice with butter and bake in a 350 F oven for 20
  minutes or until lightly browned. Dip the hot baklava slices, one at
  a time, in cold syrup, allowing each piece to remain in the syrup for
  a few minutes.

 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 lb Phyllo pastry sheets
    3/4 lb Sweet butter; melted

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      3 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Fine grain semolina

MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
  2 2/3 c  Sugar
      2 c  Water
      2 tb Lemon juice
 
  Preheat oven to 350 F after the filling has been prepared.
  
  Divide the pastry into 2-equal parts.  Lay 1 sheet on a well-buttered
  11 x 16 inch baking pan.  Brush surface generously with melted
  butter. Lay second sheet on top of first and butter. Repeat until
  half of the pastry sheets have been used.
  
  Cover unused half of pastry sheets with a kitchen cloth to prevent
  drying.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Over medium heat bring milk, sugar and salt to
  a boil in a saucepan.  Add farina by sprinkling in a little at a
  time, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and the farina
  is well cooked.
  
  Spread the hot farina mixture evenly over the entire surface of pastry
  sheets.  Again build up the remaining half of the pastry sheets,
  buttering each surface generously, on top of farina. Pour the
  remaining butter over the top.  Cut pastry sheets into 24 equal
  squares. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until light golden.
  
  While the baklava is cooking prepare syrup:  Place sugar, water, and
  lemon juice in a saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
  constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil and simer for
  15 minutes without stirring.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.
  
  Remove baklava from oven.  Pour off all excess butter by tilting the
  pan. Cook for 10 minutes.  Brush surface lightly with some of the
  drained butter to give luster to the pastry. Pour syrup over a little
  at a time, until all is absorbed.  Allow to cool for several hours.

      Yield: 40 Servings
 
      1 lb Phyllo dough sheets
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted
    1/2 c  Chopped pistachio nuts, opt.

MMMMM------------------------NUT FILLING-----------------------------
      2    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Caster sugar
      2 c  Coarsely ground walnuts
      2 c  Coarsely ground almonds
      1 ts Rose water

MMMMM------------------------ALTAR SYRUP-----------------------------
      2 c  Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Lemon juice
      1 ts Orange flower water
      1 ts Rose water
 
      Stack 10 sheets phyllo on a flat surface, keeping remainder
  covered with a dry, then a damp tea towel.
      Brush top sheet of stack with butter, lift sheet and replace on
  stack buttered side down.  Brush top with butter, lift top two sheets
  and turn over on stack. Repeat until all 10 sheets are buttered,
  lifting an extra sheet each time.  Top and bottom of finished stack
  should remain unbuttered.
      With kitchen scissors cut buttered stack of phyllo into
  approximately 10 cm (4 inches) squares.  Stack and cover. Prepare
  remainder of phyllo. Depending on size of phyllo sheets, you may have
  fewer than 10 left at the end.  Halve sheets if necessary to give 10
  layers.
      Beat egg whites until stiff and beat sugar in gradually. Fold in
  nuts and rose water.
      Butter top of phyllo square and place a tablespoonful of nut
  mixture in the centre.  Gently squeeze into a lily shape, with four
  corners of square as petals and filling in centre.
      Place in a buttered 25 x 33 cm (10 x 13 inch) baking dish. Repeat
  with remaining ingredients, placing finished pastries close together
  in dish.
      Bake in moderate oven for 30 minutes, reduce to slow and cook for
  further 15 minutes.
      Meanwhile dissolve sugar in water over heat, add lemon juice and
  orange water and bring to the boil. Boil for 15 minutes, stir in rose
  water and cool.
      Spoon cool thick syrup over hot pastries.  Leave until cool and
  sprinkle pistachio nuts in centres of pastries if desired.
      Note: If you are not used to working with phyllo pastry, then it
  is advisable to fill and shape the first lot of buttered squares
  before going onto the nest lot. The butter firms fairly quickly and
  it could be difficult to shape the pastries if the buttered sheets
  are left for a time.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 2ervings
 
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      8    Slightly underripe bananas
      3    Juice of limes
      3 tb Light brown sugar
 
  This recipe calls for slightly underripe bananas because, as they
  cook, they'll soften up quite a bit. Lime juice keeps the bananas from
  discoloring, so they are easily made ahead through step 3. The sweet
  and tangy combination is just right served after your jazzy meal.
  
  1. Preheat oven to 375'F.
  
  2. Butter a shallow baking dish; reserve remaining butter.
  
  3. Peel and layer bananas in the buttered dish and drizzle with lime
  juice.
  
  4. Sprinkle with sugar and dot bananas with remaining butter. Bake
  for 30 minutes, basting once or twice with sauce. Remove bananas from
  dish carefully with a long spatula. Serve hot, with sauce spooned on
  top.

 Categories: Low, Fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 bn (~1-1.5 lb?) of swiss chard
           (or greens of choice)
      1    2 tomatoes, chopped (or one
        cn Chopped tomatoes)
      1    2 T balsamic vinegar
           Freshly cracked black pepper
           To taste
 
  Wash the chard and chop or tear into peices, discarding tough stems.
  Saute tomatoes over medium heat in large skillet until cooked to
  desired consistancy, 5-15 min. (I like mine on the soft side). Add
  vinegar, chard and water if needed.  Cover and steam vegetables until
  cooked to desired doneness, 5-15 min. Check occasionally to be sure
  there is enough water in the pan.
  
  Cooking time for tomatoes and greens depends on how tough the greens
  are, smaller, younger leaves will be more tender; and how well cooked
  you like the vegetables.

      Title: BALSAMIC GLAZED SWEET & SOUR ONIONS
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Cipolline or small (1 1/2")
           -onions
      4 tb Virgin olive oil
      3 tb Sweet butter
      2 tb Sugar
      1 c  Balsamic vinegar
    1/2 c  Basic tomato sauce
      1 c  Water
      1 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
           -leaves
 
  Peel the onions, leaving and washing any root strand you may find.
  
  In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan over a medium high flame, heat virgin
  olive oil until just smoking. Add butter and cook until foam
  subsides. Add onions and saute until light golden brown on all sides,
  about 8 to 10 minutes. Add sugar, vinegar, tomato sauce and water and
  bring to a boil.
  
  Cook onions uncovered, until just al dente, about 10 minutes. If
  liquid dissipates too quickly, add more water, a 1/4 cup at a time,
  realizing that it is essential not to overcook the onions. The sauce
  should just adhere to the onions. Remove from saute pan to an
  earthenware dish and hold in a warm place, or allow to cool if you
  are serving them later or as an antipasto.

      Title: BAM BAAP (KOREAN CHESTNUT RICE)
 Categories: Rice, Korean
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Rice
      6    Chestnuts
  3 1/2 c  ;water
 
  Korean chestnuts are the size of a small egg -- very large, solid and
  sweet. It is astonishing in the autumn, the chestnut season, to see a
  large heap of these giant chestnuts piled in pyramids in the public
  marketplaces. In New York, during the Thanksgiving/Christmas season,
  reasonably good chestnuts imported from Italy are available and make
  a satisfactory substitute.
  
  Prepare the chestnuts in this manner: Chestnuts that have been well
  dried by leaving them at room temperature for a day or two are easier
  to peel with a serrated knife. Sometimes the peel can be broken off
  with your fingers. To remove the inner and outer skin, cut off about
  half of the thick outer shell and drop the chestnuts in boiling
  water. Cover the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Drain, cool enough to
  handle, then pull off both skins.
  
  1. Rinse the rice in cold water and drain.
  
  2. Peel the chestnuts of their outer brown skins and the inner,
  thinner skin linings. Cut them into halves, if large, or leave them
  whole if they are small.
  
  3. Combine the rice, chestnuts and water, bring to a boil, then

      Title: BAN DUA CA RA MEN (COCONUT FLAN WITH CARAMEL)
 Categories: Vietnam, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Dessert
 
MMMMM--------------------------CARAMEL-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Hot water

MMMMM--------------------------CUSTARD-------------------------------
      1 c  Fresh or canned coconut milk
      1 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  This is the ultimate coconut dessert++an adaptation of the classic
  "Creme renversee", or "Flan au caramel". The technique used is
  distinctly French but the flavors are all Vietnamese.
  
  This custard is at its best when prepared a day in advance and
  refrigerated so the flavors can mellow. If you just can't wait, you
  might try the Vietnamese method of rapid cooling for dishes such as
  this: place a small scoop of shaved ice on top of each custard before
  serving!
  
  Preheat the oven to 325F.
  
  Make the caramel:  Cook the sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low
  heat, swirling the pan constantly, until brown. Stir the hot water
  into the caramel, being careful to guard against splattering (the
  mixture will bubble vigorously).  Boil the mixture, swirling the pan
  occasionally, until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, about 2
  minutes.
  
  Pour the caramel syrup into a 1-quart souffle dish or five 4-ounce
  ramekins.  Tilt the molds to coat all of the surfaces with caramel.
  
  Make the custard:  Combine the coconut milk, milk and sugar in a
  medium saucepan over low heat.  Scald until the sugar dissolves
  completely. Remove from heat.
  
  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla. Gradually whisk the hot
  coconut milk mixture into the eggs, blending thoroughly.
  
  Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl. Carefully pour
  into the caramel-lined souffle dish or ramekins.
  
  Line a large roasting pan with 2 layers of paper towels (see Note).
  Put the souffle dish in the roasting pan and add hot water to reach
  halfway up the side of the dish.  Bake in the center of the oven for
  50 minutes (30 minutes if using ramekins), or until a knife inserted
  in the center comes out clean.  Be careful not to let the water boil;
  do not disturb the custard while baking.  This is the only "secret"
  to producing a smooth and velvety custard.
  
  Remove the souffle dish immediately from the hot water. Allow to cool
  in a cold-water bath.  Chill thoroughly.
  
  To serve, run a knife around the edge of the custard and turn out onto
  dessert plates.  Serve with shaved ice or whipped cream, if desired.
  
  Note:  The paper towels in the roasting pan serve a twofold purpose:
  First, they allow the hot water to circulate under the souffle dish
  while baking to distribute the heat evenly; second, if using small
  ramekins, it stabilizes them and keeps them from moving around while
  baking.
  
  Yield: 5 servings.

      Title: BAN-BAN JI (BEATEN CHICKEN)
 Categories: Chicken, Appetizers, Chinese
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Chicken breast; poached &
           -shredded
      5 tb Ginger, fresh; finely
           -chopped
      7    Garlic clove; finely chopped
     12 tb Tahini
     12 tb Red oil
      4 ts Chinese vinegar
      4 tb Soy sauce
      3 tb Sugar
      1 ts Szechuan "flower" pepper
           -ground
      5 tb Sesame oil
 
  Poach the chicken breasts very gently, for about 20 minutes total.
  Leave them in the water to cool down. Shred them into matchstick
  sized pieces of chicken (you can decide whether it's big kitchen
  matches or little, book matches).
  
  Mix all the other ingredients in a kitchen blender or food processor
  until well-blended.  (This recipe, very minimally adapted from the
  book noted below, is a double recipe. My blender, all 650 watts of
  brute horsepower, had trouble moving the entire quantity once the
  lower part was well- blended -- it would have been better to have
  made this in two regular- sized batches, rather than one double-sized
  batch.)
  
  Serve the room-temperature sauce over the room-temperature chicken.
  (Obviously, can be prepared well ahead of time. Don't shred the
  chicken until at most a few hours before the meal, however, because
  it will dry out.)  Suggestion: spoon half the sauce over the chicken
  just before it's served; reserve the other half for people who want
  extra "zip" in their dish. Garnishes optional.
  
  Caution: direct from the cookbook, this produces a fairly spicy sauce
  to put on the chicken.  But for people who REALLY want a hot dish,
  you can add an almost arbitrary amount of red oil (pepper oil) to the
  dish, maybe just cutting back on the sesame oil or the soy sauce if
  you do so. I've had this dish so hot that my lips went numb -- best
  "bung-bung" (as it's usually spelled) chicken in the world!

      Title: BANANA & POMEGRANATE SALAD
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 tb Palm Sugar
      2    Pomegranates
      3    Bananas
           Juice of 2 limes
           Lime Dressing
 
  This is a side-dish from the north of India. It makes a refreshing and
  pretty contrast to a highly spiced dish and couldn't be simpler. Try
  it next time you are having a curry meal, or use it as one of several
  salads for entertaining.
  
  Mix together the juice of 2 limes and a tablespoon of palm sugar (or
  substitute brown sugar). Taste and adjust for sweet- sour balance if
  necessary. Cut 2 pomegranates which have been chilling in the fridge
  into quarters and twist each wedge to help free the seeds. Coax them
  out and mound them in the centre of a serving dish. Slice 3 bananas
  and arrange them around the peri- meter of the pomegranate seeds.
  Sprinkle with the lime dressing and serve.

MMMMM----------------------BANANA RUM SAUCE---------------------------
    2/3 c  Unsalted butter,

    1/2 c  Packed light brown sugar
      6 lg Ripe bananas, quartered
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
      3 tb Dark rum
      2 tb Banana liqueur
    1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
 
  Chef Frank Brigtsen of Brigtsen's Restaurant in Uptown New Orleans is
  a fantastic cross between the classic bread pudding and Bananas
  Foster, the great flaming bananas and ice cream dessert.
  
  Preheat the oven to 300F. Put the French bread pieces into a 9x12x2
  inch baking pan. In a blender or food processor, blend the eggs,
  milk, 2/3 cup of sugar, bananas, cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of
  the vanilla until smooth. Pour this mixture over the French bread
  pieces. Fold in the raisins and the pecans and let the mixture set
  for 20 minutes. Top with small pieces of the butter.
  
  Cover the pudding with aluminum foil and place the pan into a larger
  pan. Add warm water to a depth of 1 inch in the larger pan. Bake for
  1 hour. Remove the foil and bake uncovered for 15 minutes until set.
  
  In a deep, medium bowl, whisk the cream just until it begins to
  thicken. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1/4 teaspoon
  vanilla. Continue whisking unti soft peaks form. Cover and chill.
  
  Banana Rum Sauce Heat a large saute pan or skillet over low heat. Add
  the butter, sugar, bananas, cinnamon and nutmeg. Moving the skillet
  back and forth, cook until the butter and sugar become creamy and the
  bananas begin to soften, about one minute. Remove the skillet from
  heat and add the rum and the liqueur. Return the pan to the heat.
  Tilt the pan, avert your face and and light the liquid with a long
  match. Shake the skillet until the flames subside. Add the vanilla,
  remove from heat and keep warm.
  
  To serve, place a large scoop of bread pudding in the middle of each
  serving plate or bowl. Place 2 slices of banana on each plate and top
  with about 3 tablespoons of sauce. Spoon the whipped cream over the
  bread pudding and serve immediately.  Walt MM

      Title: BANANA BREAD PUDDING WITH RUM SAUCE
 Categories: Breads, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Bread pudding
      2 c  Milk
      1 c  Heavy (whipping) cream
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Large egg yolks
      1    Large egg
      1 tb Vanilla extract
      1 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
           Pinch of salt
      5    Slices (each 1/2 in thick) f
           -resh banana bread
      3    Large bananas, cut into 1/4
           -in. thick rounds
           -----for the rum sauce-----
      4 tb Unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
      3 tb Dark brown sugar
      2 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
    1/2 c  Rum
    1/4 c  Water
           -----garnish-----
      2 c  Heavy whipping cream, whippe
           -d to soft peaks
 
  1.  Generously butter a 12-cup ovenproof baking dish.
  
  2.  To make the custard, whisk the milk, cream, and sugar together in
  a large bowl.  Add the egg yolks and the whole egg one at a time,
  whisking well after each addition. Whisk in the vanilla, nutmeg, and
  salt, and set aside.
  
  3.  Cut four slices of the banana bread vertically into 1-inch-wide
  fingers.  Arrange an even layer of bread fingers on the bottom of the
  prepared dish, cutting and fitting them to cover the bottom. It is
  fine if they curve slightly up the sides of the dish. Cover the bread
  slices with an even layer of banana slices, and then pour enough
  custard over the bread and bananas to cover them.  Repeat the layers
  of bread and bananas. Cut the remaining slice of banana bread into
  cubs, and sprinkle these over the bananas, press down slightly on the
  bread cubes, and cover. Set aside for 30 minutes.
  
  4.  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  5.  Bake the pudding until it is almost solid through, about 45
  minutes. Then remove the cover and bake until the cubes of banana
  bread on the top are golden, an additional 15 minutes. Remove the
  dish from the oven and cool it on a wire rack.
  
  6.  While the bread pudding is cooling, make the sauce: Melt the
  butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the brown
  sugar, lemon juice, rum, and water, and bring to a rolling boil.
  Cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture begins to thicken and
  the sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove the sauce from the
  heat and transfer it to a serving pitcher.  Serve along with the
  slighly cooled banana bread pudding and whipped cream, if you like.
