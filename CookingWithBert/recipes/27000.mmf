      Title: GERMAN WHITE CHOCOLATE CAKE
 Categories: Chocolate, German, Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Cake flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      4 lg Eggs, separated
      4 oz White chocolate, melted in
           -1/2 c boiling water and
           -cooled
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Buttermilk
      1 c  Shredded unsweetened coconut
      1 c  Chopped pecans
           Frosting
      1 c  Evaporated milk
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter
      3 lg Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Chopped pecans
      1 c  Shredded unsweetened coconut
 
  CAKE
  
  1. Position the racks in the upper and lower thirds and preheat oven
  to 350 deg F. Lightly butter the bottom and sides of three 8 inch
  round cake pans. Line the pans with parchment paper. Dust the bottom
  and sides with flour; tap out the excess.
  
  2. Into a medium bowl, sift the cake flour and the baking soda. Using
  an electric mixer set at mdeium speed, cream the butter and the sugar
  in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in one
  egg yolk at a time, blending well after each addition. Beat in the
  melted white chocolate mixture and the vanilla. At low speed, blend
  in the sifted flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk; do not
  overbeat. Fold in the coconut and pecans.
  
  3. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Blend 1/3 of the egg
  whites into the cake mixture to lighten it; carefully fold in the
  remaining egg whites.  Spoon the batter into the prepared pans.
  
  4. Bake until the cake springs back when touched in the center and a
  cake tester inserted in the center of the pans comes out clean, about
  35 to 40 minutes. Transfer the cakes in the pans to wire racks and
  cool 10 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the wire racks, carefully peel
  off the parchment paper, and cool completely.
  
  FOR THE FROSTING:
  
  5. In a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the evaporated
  milk, sugar, butter, and egg yolks. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
  constantly. Do not let mixture boil fast; lower the heat if necessary.
  Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, pecans, and coconut. Plance
  the saucepan into a bowl filled with ice and stir constantly until
  the frosting is cool and slightly thickened.
  
  6. Place a cake layer on a serving platter. Spread 1/4 of the frosting
  evenly over the cake layer, making sure to spread it all the way to
  the edges. Top with the second layer, and spread with 1/4 of the
  frosting. Top with the third cake layer.  Evenly frost the top and
  sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.

      Title: GERMAN-STYLE MUSTARD
 Categories: Spreads, German, Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Yellow mustard seed
      2 tb Black or brown mustard seed,
           -heaping
    1/4 c  Dry mustard
    1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
      1 sm Onion chopped
      2 tb Firmly packed brown sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2    Garlic gloves, minced or
           -pressed
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
    1/4 ts Dried tarragon leaves
    1/8 ts Turmeric
 
  Adapted from Gift Ideas from the Kitchen
  
  In a small bowl, combine mustard seed and dry mustard. In a 1- to
  2-quart non-aluminim pan, combine remaining ingredients. Simmer
  uncovered, on medium heat until reduced by half, 10-15 minutes. Pour
  the mixture into the mustard mixture. Let mixture soak at room
  temperature 24 to 48 hours,adding additional vinegar if neccesary in
  order to maintain enough liquid to cover seeds.
  
  Process the seeds and mixture in a blender or food processor until
  pureed to the texture you like --this can take at least 3 or 4
  minutes. Some prefer whole seeds remaining, others a smooth paste.
  The mixture will thicken considerably upon standing. If it gets too
  thick after a few days,stir in additional vinegar.
  
  Scrape mustard into clean, dry jars; cover tightly and age at least 3
  days

      Title: GESMOORDE VIS (SALT COD & POTATOES WITH TOMAT
 Categories: African, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Salt cod
      3 md Boiling potatoes (about 1
           -pound)
      4 md Firm ripe tomatoes
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      3 sm Onions, peeled and cut
           -crosswise into slices 1/8
           -inch thick
      1 tb Plus 1 teaspoon finely
           -chopped fresh hot chilies
      1 ts Finely chopped garlic
      1 tb Light-brown sugar
      1    Lemon, cut lengthwise into
           -4 or 6 wedges
           Parsley sprigs
 
  Starting a day ahead, place the cod in a glass, enameled or
  stainless-steel pan or bowl.  Cover it with cold water and soak for
  at least 12 hours, gently squeezing the cod dry and changing the
  water every 3 or 4 hours.
  
  Drain the cod, rinse it thoroughly under cold running water, and cut
  it into 1-inch pieces.
  
  Drop the potatoes into enough lightly salted boiling water to cover
  them completely and cook briskly, uncovered, until they are almost
  tender and show only slight resistance when pierced with the point of
  a sharp knife. Drain and peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch
  cubes.
  
  Place the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water and let them boil
  briskly for about 10 seconds.  Run cold water over them, and peel
  them with a small, sharp knife. Cut the tomatoes crosswise into
  1/8-inch- thick rounds.
  
  In a heavy 10 to 12-inch skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat
  until a light haze forms above it.  Drop in the onions and, stirring
  frequently, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are soft and
  golden brown. Watch carefully for any sign of burning and regulate
  the heat accordingly. Add the tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of the chilies,
  the garlic and sugar, and cook briskly, uncovered, stirring from time
  to time, until most of the liquid in the pan has evaporated and the
  mixture is thick enough to hold its shape lightly in a spoon.
  
  Stir in the cod and potatoes, reduce the heat to low, and cover
  tightly. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily
  when prodded gently with a fork. Taste for seasoning.
  
  Serve the gesmoorde vis at once, mounded on a heated platter or in a
  large bowl.  Sprinkle with the remaining teaspoon of chopped chilies
  and arrange the lemon wedges and parsley sprigs decoratively on top.
  Serve accompanied, if you like, by hot boiled rice and lemon or green
  bean atjar.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

  The Riverside Park in the historic little southeast Iowa town of
  Bentonsport is where Jane Dooley of Fairfield, Iowa, and her family
  gathers for summer reunions. Her chicken and vegetables steam on the
  grill in easy-to-serve foil packets.
  
  1.  Place each chicken breast on an 18-inch square piece of heavy-duty
      foil.
  
  2.  Divide all vegetables among foil packages and season with some
  salt
      and pepper.  Drizzle with some apple juice.  Seal foil well,
  leaving
      room for steam.
  
  3.  Place directly over medium-hot coals.  Grill 20 to
       25    minutes, turning
      once, till chicken is done and vegetables are tender. Open
  packets to
      serve.  Drizzle with preserves, if you like.
  
  Picnic Hint:  Assemble chicken-filled packets at home, and transport
  them to the picnic site in a cooler filled with ice. To melt
  preserves, place in a heavy-duty plastic container and set it in the
  sun on your car's dash or back window.  Or place in metal bowl off to
  the side on the grill till melted.

      1 c  Fresh gluten-free buttermilk
    1/4 c  Butter, melted
      1 ts Rice vinegar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Brown rice flour
    1/3 c  Potato starch flour
    1/3 c  Tapioca flour
    1/4 c  Sugar

      3    Eggs
    1/2 c  Water (Welbilt/DAK & Z +2 Tb
  1 1/2 tb Active dry yeast
 
  Gene Hill, who lives in Davis, California, bakes this bread at least
  twice a week.  He recommends trying it as a toasted cheese sandwich.
  Grill it with thin slices of red onion or bell pepper and cheese.
  
  1.  Place the buttermilk, melted butter, rice vinegar, and salt in
  bread pan.  Stir with a rubber spatula.
  
  2.  In a large bowl, combine all the dry ingredients except the
  yeast. Mix well with a whisk.
  
  3.  In a separate bowl, combine the eggs and water; beat lightly.
  
  4.  Place 1/2 of the dry ingredients in the bread pan. Add the egg
  mixture. Add the remainder of the dry ingredients; sprinkle the yeast
  on top. Select Light Crust setting and press Start.
  
  5.  Observe the dough frequently during the kneading cycles. If it
  does not appear to be mixing well, use a rubber spatula to assist it
  occasionally.
  
  6.  After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on wire
  rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.
  
  VARIATIONS * You can substitute olive oil for the butter. * Replace
  1/4 to 1/2 cup of the rice flour with another gluten-free flour, such
  as yellow or blue corn flour, polenta meal, or soy flour. * You can
  add at least 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese for a new flavor. * Saute
  some onions in the melted butter, allow them to cool, then add them
  and your favorite herbs to create an onion/herb bread.

      Title: GF STARTER FOR SOURDOUGH
 Categories: Breads, Sourdough
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Pinch sugar
      1 c  Lukewarm water
      1 tb Yeast granules
  1 1/2 c  White rice flour
 
  This recipe is intended for people who are allergic to gluten and
  cannot make starter with wheat flour.
  
  In a quart glass container or crock, add the sugar to the warm water.
  Dissolve the yeast in the mixture. Add the flour, stirring well. Let
  sit in a warm place until fermented and bubbly, 2 to 3 hours. When
  bubbly and risen a little, cover and refrigerate. Starter is ready to
  be used.
  
  At each using, the cookbook author finds it works best if taken from
  the fridge and allowed to warm about 1 hour before putting into the
  dough mixture.
  
  After each use, replenish the started by mixing in 1/2 cup lukewarm
  water and 3/4 cup rice flour. Adapted from More from the Gluten-Free

 Categories: Sauces and, Fish & shel
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
     12 md Cooked shrimp -- shelled
      1 ts Red pepper -- paste, as
           Follows
           ~Ghana Red Pepper Paste
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
      1 ts Ground red pepper (Cayenne)
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
    1/8 ts Ground cardamom
    1/8 ts Ground coriander
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/8 ts Pepper
    1/8 ts Onion powder
      1 ts Garlic -- powder
    1/4 c  Paprika
 
  If using frozen, thaw, wash, and dry the shrimp. Remove shells. Place
  the measure of Ghana Sauce in a glass bowl; add shrimp and toss to
  coat well. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Heat the
  WOK; spray with a little oil; add the shrimp and cook till hot; no
  more than 5 minutes. Serve at once with a black bean salad, like
  Texas Caviar (or Crowder Bean salsa). Steamed rice is nice.
  
  Place all ingredients except the paprika in a small glass bowl. Stir
  well. Heat paprika in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat 1 minute,
  stirring constantly.  Gradually stir in the spice mixture until the
  paste is smooth. Heat about 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until
  hot. Cool for a dipping sauce.  Cool for a marinade. Freeze for
  future use.
  
  Alternative: Heat paprika, cumin and ground coriander in a dry pan
  over low to medium-low heat to "toast" and renew the dried spices.
  Remove from the heat and transfer to a 1-cup pyrex measure for
  further blending. Add the other spices to the pan. Stirring
  constantly, add the wine and make a paste. I have stored the paste in
  a space jar for 2 months. Might last longer in a zip-lock bag that
  can be "burped" or if we didn't use it up in other recipes calling
  for a sweet-hot sauce.

      Title: GHEE
 Categories: Indian, Balti, Fat
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 lb Butter
 
  Put the butter into a good-sized nonstick pan.  Melt at the lowest
  possible heat.
  
  When it's all melted, increase heat slightly.  There must be no sign
  of smoke or any other undue activity indicating too much heat. Leave
  the butter to stew (the only word for it, really) for about an hour.
  Watch it carefully to make sure it doesn't get too hot and start to
  scorch. The milk solids will fall to the bottom of the pan: others
  will float on top.
   DON'T STIR or agitate the pan under any circumstances!
  
  At the one-hour point, carefully skim off any remaining floating
  stuff with a skimmer or slotted spoon. Remove the ghee from the heat
  and allow it to cool for 10-15 minutes.  Strain it into a heatproof
  jar through a triple thickness of cheesecloth, or a thickness of
  butter muslin if you can get it, or even through paper towels.
  
  The ghee will solidify, but it won't get too hard.  It should be light
  yellow and have a lovely butterscotchy aroma. Keep it tightly covered
  in a cool place.  It will keep almost indefinitely if you've
  successfully gotten all the milk solids out.
  
  Cholesterol alert, for those needing one:  This is 100% pure
  butterfat. Use in moderation.

      Title: GHEE (INDIAN BUTTER OIL)
 Categories: India, Condiments
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
      2 lb Butter, unsalted
 
    Divide butter into 1/4 pound pieces. In heavy 5 qt. saucepan, heat
  butter over moderate heat, stirring to melt slowly and completely
  without letting it brown. When completely melted, increase heat and
  bring the butter to a boil.
    When the surface is completely covered with white foam, stir the
  butter gently and reduce heat to the lowest possible point. Simmer
  uncovered and undisturbed for 45 minutes, or until the milk solids on
  the bottom of the pan are golden brown and the butter on top is
  transparent.
    Slowly pour the ghee through a linen towel or 4 layers of moistened
  cheesecloth. If the are any solids, no matter how small, strain again
  to prevent oil from becoming rancid later. The ghee must be perfectly
  clear.
    Pour the ghee into a jar or crock, cover tightly and store in
  refrigerator or at room temperature until ready to use. Ghee will
  solidify when it is chilled. If may be safely kept at room
  temperature for 2 or 3 months.
  
  NOTES: Although ghee resembles clarified butter, the long low heat
  cooking imparts a distinctive nutlike flavor that cannot be
  duplicated.

  Recipe by: 365 Great Chocolate Desserts - ISBN 0-06-016537-5
  Preparation Time: 0:41 1. Preheat oven to 375 F. Grease six 8-inch
  foil pie pans. Foil pans must be used for easy removal of baked
  florentines in 1 piece. 2. In a medium-large heavy saucepan, combine
  butter, sugar, honey, and cream. Heat to boiling over medium heat,
  stirring frequently. Cook 1 1/2 mins, stirring constantly. Remove
  from heat. Stir in almonds. 3. Divide mixture evenly among greased
  pie pans. Using back of wooden spoon, pat evenly into bottom of pans.
  Bake pans 3 at a time, on a single oven rack, 10 to 14 mins, or until
  a rich golden brown. Rotate pans during baking, if necessary, to
  avoid overbrowning. Let cool completely in pans. Refrigerate 10 to 15
  mins for ease in unmolding. 4. With fingers, carefully press in pan
  bottoms from underneath and pop florentines out in 1 piece.
  Refrigerate florentines, stacked between layers of wax paper until
  thoroughly chilled, about 3 hours. 5. Spread melted chocolate coating
  over bottoms of chilled florentines. Let stand until chocolate is
  set. Wrap each florentine separately in plastic wrap. Store in
  refrigerator.
  
  NOTE: Use melted chocolate-coating wafers, which are available at cake
  decorating and candy supply stores, to spread on the bottoms of
  florentines for best results. This type of chocolate will stay shiny
  and give your florentines a professional look. These make fantastic
  holiday gifts.

 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Jo Ferry cmsj69b
    1/2 c  Joy or Dawn dish detergent
      5 c  Water; distilled is best
      2 tb Glycerine
 
    Mix the dish detergent with the water. (Measure carefully, it makes
  a big difference. Stir. Add the glycerine (you can usually get this
  in a drug store), this makes more durable bubbles.
    You can bend a wire coat hanger into a circle and wind a string
  around it. Depending on how big you make your circle, you get great
  big bubbles. The string helps in getting the liquid to stay on the
  circle.
    You can also use straws and string-Tie a 2 1/2 foot length of string
  through 2 straws and unleash square <G> bubbles. The trick is to dip
  your string and straw thing into the solution, then wave it through
  the air. Break the bubble off by flipping the apparatus up a bit.
    Plain straws make good bubble pipes. Also try using the plastic
  strawberry baskets, they make lots of little bubbles. It is fun to
  experiment with all different bubble makers.
    Big-time bubble making is a bit like fishing. You'll have much
  better luck in cool wet weather. Early evenings, nighttime and early
  mornings are often good. Just after a rain is ideal. Don't throw any
  leftovers away either. The longer your solution sits, the better it
  gets.

      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Chopped walnuts (optional)
 
  Combine sugar, cocoa, butter, and milk in a 2 qt. casserole.
  Microwave on HIGH 2 minutes.  Add vanilla and walnuts. Stir, pour
  into a generously buttered large funnel (rubber band a piece of foil
  over spout of funnel) making sure you fill the spout end. Place
  funnel in a tumbler and set in freezer or frig until set. When set
  carefully unmold and wrap with foil creating a big "kiss". You can
  add a streamer with your own sentiments if desired.
  
  NOTE:  If desired, you can make smaller kisses by using the small
  funnels which are used to fill perfume bottles. These make the
  regular "kiss" size chocolates.  These funnels can be purchased in
  many cosmetic departments at variety stores, department stores and
  gadget stores.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter
      2    Egg
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Milk
      1 ds Nutmeg
           Lemon juice
           Sugar, confectioners
 
  Melt butter in 10 inch pie pan or cast iron skillet. In bowl, mix all
  flour, milk and eggs.  Don't over beat, leave lumpy. Pour mixture on
  top of melted butter, sprinkle with nutmeg. Bake at 425 F. for 15 to
  20 minutes. Sprinkle with lemon juice and dust with powdered sugar.
  Serve with preserves or marmalade. I find that splitting the batter
  in two halves, and baking it in metal pie plates works well, that way
  you don't have to cut it in half. A squirt of fresh lemon juice, a
  dusting of powdered sugar, and FAR too much apricot preserves on top
  makes it a fantastic breakfast...

      Yield: 6 Giants
 
MMMMM----------------MM FORMAT BY MARY ANN YOUNG---------------------

MMMMM---------------------------ROLLS--------------------------------
      1 pk Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix
      2 tb Sugar
      1 c  Water; heated to 120-130
      2 tb Butter or margarine; soft
      1    Egg

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Butter or margerine; soft
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/4 c  Finely chopped nuts

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      1 tb Butter or margarine; soft
      2 tb 2-3 tb milk
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  Grease 13x9x2 inch pan. In large bowl, combine flour mixture with
  yeast from foil packet and 2 tb sugar; blend well. Stir in HOT water,
  2 tb margarine and egg until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.
  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. With greased or floured
  hands, shape dough into a ball. Knead dough for 5 minutes until
  smooth. Cover with large bowl; let rest 5 minutes.
  
  On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 15x10 inch rectangle.
  Spread 1/4 cup margarine or butter evenly over dough. In small bowl,
  combine 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle with raisins and nuts.
  Starting with 10-inch side, roll up tightly, pressing edges to seal.
  Cut into 6 slices and place, cut side down, into greased pan. (At
  this point, dough can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated
  overnight. Dough may rise in refrigerator. If necessary, let dough
  stand at room temperature before baking until almost doubled in
  original side. Then, bake as usual).
  
  If baking same day, you still cover loosely with plastic wrap and
  cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80-85 degrees) until almost
  doubled, about 30 minutes. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Then, uncover
  dough and bake rolls for 20-30 minutes till golden brown. Cool 1
  minute. Remove from pan and cool for 10 minutes. (This keeps bottom
  from getting soggy.)
  
  Drizzle glaze ingredients over rolls which may have been placed back
  in pan first.
  
  TIP: To speed up the process of rising, I heat oven to about 200
  degrees for 5 minutes or so, then turn it off before putting pans in
  just to rise before final baking. I do this when you can't ensure
  room being at proper warmth or drafty. Otherwise, rolls will take too
  long to rise and will be either heavy in consistency or too small.)

  1. Peel carrots, cut in half lengthwise then into 4cm (1.5 inch) long
  pieces. Cut celery into similar sized pieces. Remove seeds from
  Capsicums and cut into 2cm (3/4 inch) strips, 4cm long. Break the
  cauliflower into 4cm flowerets. Dissolve the salt in cold water.
  Dissolve the salt in cold water. Cover the vegetables with this brine

  then dry in a warm oven, 100 deg C.
  
  3. In a large enamel or stainless steel pan combine vinegar, mustard
  seed, celery seed, chillies and sugar. Boil for 3 minutes and then
  add the carrots and onions and boil for 5 minutes. Fill the warmed
  jars with hot vegetables and top up with vinegar to within 1cm (half
  inch) of rim. Close lids firmly.

  salt and 1/2 cup sugar. In another bowl beat 3 egg yolks, 1 teaspoon
  vanilla and sour cream; add yeast; add scalded milk and sweet butter
  which was added to the milk and cooled.  Add this to the flour bowl
  and knead to a soft silky dough, not sticky.  Let rise in a greased
  bowl until double in bulk. Make sure the dough is soft as it has to
  stretch.
  
  On floured cloth roll dough to about 1/4 to 1/2 inch in thickness;
  stretch gently so it won't break. Stretch oblone bout 30 x 20 inches
  (use rolling pin if necessary) and fill with following filling.

  vanilla, sugar and scant of salt (that's what it says! -KM), then add
  scaled milk with butter. Mix, then add stiffly beaten egg whites. If
  thick, add a little more milk.  Spread on dough like you would for
  nut roll and roll like a jelly roll (make as sweet as desired).
  Grease roasting pan 4 to 6 inches in depth and fill pan; start at one
  edge of pan; make a "U" shape. Do not cut if roll is longer; turn
  again. Brush with milk. Prick with knife on top for air bubbles. Let
  stand 1 hour. Bake at 350 F for 1 hour. Take out and brush with
  butter. Let cool, then flop it on a cloth and place it on a rack to

 Categories: Penndutch, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Liver
      1 x  Gizzard
      1 x  Heart
      1 x  Water
      1 x  Flour
      1 x  Salt & pepper
 
  *** My notes:  This is the way I've always made giblet gravy, except
  that I add chopped celery and onion, the neck, and some poultry
  seasoning, salt, and pepper while boiling the giblets. I usually add
  a little Kitchen Bouquet at the end to brown the gravy, also. Wash
  thoroughly the liver, gizzard and heart and cover with water and cook
  until tender. Drain off the water and save. Chop the giblets fine.
  Pour off most of the fat in which the poultry has been cooked,
  leaving about 4 Tbsp of it in the pan. Add 3 Tbsp of flour and blend
  well. Measure the giblet water adding enough water to make 3 cups.
  Pour slowly into the browned flour, stirring constantly until mixture
  thickens. Add giblets and cook for a few minutes. Season with salt
  and pepper and serve. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old

      1    White pepper to taste
    1/4 c  Water
           Carrots; sliced for pan
           Onions; sliced for pan
      1 bn Beets; sliced (optional)
 
  Have fish man grind: 5 lbs.fish filets-equal amounts; white fish and
  pike;and a small amount of carp or buffle carp; In a large kettle:
  heads,bones,and trimmings of fish; 3 onions,sliced; 1 celery
  stalk,sliced; 2 large carrots,sliced; water to cover; salt to taste;
  white pepper to taste;  Bring to boil. While this is simmering
  prepare the fish.
    Combine in Food Processor: 1 onion; 4 eggs; add mixture to: ground
  fish; 2 tbs.matzo meal ; salt to taste; white pepper to taste; 1/4
  cup water; Shape fish mixture into balls. I used to do this by hand;
  chopping in a large wooden bowl with a hack messer. Be CARFUL, you
  don't want mush but distinct tiny peices.
    Take another pan; and layer the beets on the bottom; some sliced
  carrots, onions, fish; repeat with everything but the beets. end eith
  some carrots. Pour the broth from the OTHER kettle over the fish.
  Simmer,covered for 2 hours.  When cool,remove fish balls to platter
  and garnish with sliced cooked carrots. Strain broth and chill.
   Serve with jellied fish broth and fresh ground horseradish. NOTE: The
  beets are unusal but my Mom and Bubbe ALWAYS used them. They do two
  things; keep the fish from 'catching' on the bottom and give the
  broth a ruby red color; but not the fish; they remain white.
  
  I have never served it with anything but plain freshly grated
  horseradish.

  flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make soft dough. Knead dough until
  elastic and smooth. Place dough in oiled plastic bag or oiled bowl
  and turn to coat. Seal or cover with plastic wrap and let rise at
  room temperature until doubled, about 1 hour. Turn out dough on
  floured surface, punch down and cut into 2 pieces. Shape each into
  rectangular loaf and place on greased baking sheet. Melt remaining
  1/4 cup butter and use to lightly brush tops of loaves.
  
  TO PRESENT AS A GIFT: Make paper ribbon strips the width of your gift
  ribbons and tie the bread loosely with the paper strips; secure with
  paper clips, leaving enough room for the breads to rise. The paper
  will leave marks for the position of the gift ribbons. Cover the
  loaves with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled,
  30-to-40 minutes. Bake loaves about 30-to-45 minutes. Remove and
  place on a rack to cool. Remove the paper strips. Replace strips with

           Text below
 
  Package mixes in decorative containers that can be used to prepare or
  serve the item, with a pretty tag. BE SURE AND INCLUDE RECIPES FOR
  PREPARATION! Some examples:
  
  MAKE-A-MEAL!  Fill a picnic basket or pretty collander with Spaghetti
  Seasoning Mix, Hot Roll Mix, Creamy Parmesan Dressing Mix, and Basic
  Cookie Mix.
  
  GINGERBREAD JOY - A pretty basket or mixing bowl with Gingerbread Mix,
  containers of decorations (yogurt-coated raisins, sugar coated
  candies, etc), and a few already-made gingerbread boys if you have
  time. Tie gingerbread boy and girl cookie cutters on with the bow.
  
  COCOA TIME - Hot Cocoa Mix in a large mug or set of mugs. Put the mix
  in a plastic bag inside the mug(s) and tie the bag(s) shut with
  pretty ribbon. One of these makes a nice small gift for co-workers,
  teachers, etc.
  
  COOKIES!!!!  Fill a cookie jar with Basic Cookie Mix ~- include as
  many recipes as you can come up with and some pretty cookie cutters.
  
  BROWNIES!  Arrange brownies on a cutting board with a container of
  brownie mix.  Cover all with plastic wrap and top with a big bow.
  
  CORNBREAD TIME:   A bag of Cornmeal Mix with a crock of honey butter,
  perhaps packaged with a corn stick pan. Honey Butter: 1 cup butter,
  softened, plus 2 tb Eggbeaters, 1 1/4 cups honey -- beat with an
  electric mixer 10 minutes.  Should be refrigerated. Do not use a raw
  egg yolk in in this as specified in the original recipe, for the sake
  of food safety; Eggbeaters have been pasteurized. Tiny cornsticks
  with salsa are one of the latest things to serve as an appetizer; you
  could package the mix with a mini-cornstick pan (Williams Sonoma and
  elsewhere) and a jar of salsa.
  
  PANCAKE HEAVEN:  Pancake Mix plus jars of fancy fruit-flavored
  syrups, on a griddle.
  
  CAMPER'S/HIKER'S SPECIAL:  Homemade granola in a mess kit or other
  useful outdoor container.
  
  ITALIAN NIGHT SPECIAL:  A tall jar or wide-mouth bottle filled with
  spaghetti, plus Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning Mix, Creamy Parmesan Salad
  Dressing Mix, some biscotti and a bottle of Chianti.
  
  TACO FEED:  A package or two of taco shells plus packages of Taco
  Seasoning Mix
  
  SEASONINGS GALORE:  A spice rack or basket filled with small bottles
  of homemade seasoning mixes.  To make a wall hanging, put seasoning
  mixes in foil packets or tiny zip-loc bags (available at bead shops),
  and wrap each one in a circle of calico print fabric (cut with
  pinking shears). Tie each packet with yarn and attach to a strip of
  braided yarn and hang from a wooden ring.
  
  "SALAD DAYS" -- A pretty salad dressing cruet with several packages of
  salad dresing mixes.
  
  And so on....it's easy to come up with more ideas if you look through
  your mix recipes and think of items with go with them, either when
  they're cooked or served or consumed.
  
  Enjoy, and don't forget to make one for me!!

      1    Head Boston lettuce, torn
           Into small pieces
    1/2 c  Rice Dream

  ADAPTED
  
  Put fruit in a bowl, drain and reserve juice.
  
  Put champagne and the hot pepper in a small saucepan, bring to a boil
  and remove from heat.  Discard hot pepper and let champagne sit for
  10 minutes. Combine fruit and lettuce in a salad bowl or individual
  salad bowls. Add Rice Dream to cooled champagne and mix well. Pour
  over salad and serve immediately.
  
  The original recipe called for heavy cream, and I have tested it with
  Rice Dream.  It tastes great, but Rice Dream does have fat. I have
  not tried low fat soy milk (can't find it, for one thing), but the
  vanilla flavor would probably be perfect. It is also good, though not
  as good, without a cream substitute at all. A sweeter wine such as
  Riesling is better without Rice Dream.
  
  NOTE:  boil the wine longer if you want all of the alcohol out. I
  don't serve this to children or alcoholic friends. Most of it seems
  to be gone, however.

  The Wooden Spoon Bread Book.  These rolls are delicately flavored with
  garlic, both in the dough and in the filling. Mix all ricotta filling
  ingredients together. To soften yeast, in a large mixing bowl combine
  first 3 ingredients.  Let stand 5 minutes. Stir next 4 ingredients
  into softened yeast mixture. Beat well. To make a soft dough,
  gradually add 1 to 1 1/4 cups flour.  Turn out on  a floured surface
  and knead until smooth. Place in a well-buttered bowl, turning dough
  once to butter the top. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, 45
  to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together butter and garlic.  Punch down
  dough. Toss on a lightly floured surface until no longer sticky. Roll
  dough out to a 9 by 12 inch rectangle. With a short side facing you,
  spread bottom 2/3 of rectangle with 1/2 of butter mixture.  Fold top
  third of dough down over the center third. Fold bottom third of dough
  up over this. Press edges to seal. Wrap dough in plastic and
  refrigerate 15 minutes. Roll and fold again, using no butter. Wrap
  and refrigerate 1 hour. Divide dough in half. Seal cut edges by
  pinching together. Working with one-half of the dough at a time, roll
  into a 12-inch circle. Using a sharp knife, cut circle into 12 equal
  wedge-shaped pieces. Near the wide end of each piece place 1 tsp
  Ricotta filling. Starting with the wide end, roll each wedge to the
  point. Place, point side down, on lightly greased or nonstick baking
  sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.  Before
  baking, brush tops of rolls wiht a mixture of egg white and water.
  Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until
  golden brown. Serve warm. Makes 24 rolls.

    1/2 ts Fennel seeds
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 sm Green pepper, chopped
      6    Ripe tomatoes, medium
     12 oz Can tomato puree
      6 oz Can tomato paste
      2 ts Oregano, dried
      1 ts Basil, dried
      1 tb Parsley, dried
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese
 
  Prepare the tomatoes:  drop them into a pot of boiling water for
  about a minute.  Drain and rinse with cold water. Slip off the skins,
  cut out the "core", and coarsely chop. Set aside.
  
  In a large pot, heat the oil.  Add onion & fennel seed. Fry a couple
  minutes.  Add the pepper & garlic and fry a couple more minutes
  (don't let the precious garlic brown or burn, please!). Add the rest
  of the ingredients.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, then simmer for as
  long as you can (at least an hour), stirring occasionally. I cover
  the pot loosely when simmering.
  
  Notes:  You can use fresh herbs for the dried, and it's much better.
  Just triple the proportions for fresh. You can also add other veggies
  to the sauce during the simmer phase: carrots (shredded), green
  chilis (fresh roasted from New Mexico), chopped olives (black or
  green), sliced mushrooms.  You can also add TVP to fool meat eaters:
  soak 1 c TVP & 1/4 t fennel seed in 7/8 c boiling water for 10 min.
  Fry the TVP in some olive oil before adding to the sauce.
  
  Also, you might want to double or triple this recipe if your tomato
  "shrubs" look like mine  :-)
  
  Enjoy!

      Title: GINGER BREAD (MEDIEVAL/ELIZABETHAN)
 Categories: Sca, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Honey
    1/4 ts Powdered ginger (generous)
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground licorice
  1 3/4 c  Dry bread crumbs
      1 tb Anise seeds
 
  Course Ginger Bread--Take a quart of Honey clarified, and seeth it
  till it be brown, and if it be thick, put to it a dash of water: then
  take fine crumbs of white bread grated, and put to it, and stir it
  well, and when it is almost cold, put to it the powder of Ginger,
  Cloves, Cinamon, and a little Licorice and Anise seeds: then knead
  it, and put it into a mould and print it.  Some use to put to it also
  a little Pepper, but that is according unto taste and
  pleasure.--Gervase Markham, The English House-wife Gingerbread was
  traditionally boiled rather than baked. This recipe is not
  significantly different from medieval recipes found in fourteenth-
  and fifteenth-century manuscripts, except for the licorice-a
  brilliant touch.
  
  Loaves of gingerbread, like squares of quince and other fruit pastes,
  were often stamped with decorative designs. You may wish to
  experiment with a cookie or butter press on the top of this little
  loaf while it is still warm and malleable.
  
  1.  In the top of a double boiler, heat honey.  Add spices except
  anise seeds, and stir to blend. 2. Add bread crumbs and mix
  thoroughly. Cover and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. Mixture
  should be thick and moist. 3. Place gingerbread on a large sheet of
  waxed paper. Fold up sides of paper and mold dough into small
  rectangular shape. 4. Sprinkle anise seeds on top and press them
  gently into dough with the side of a knife. 5. Cover and refrigerate
  for 2 hours. 6. Serve gingerbread at room temperature in thin slices.

      Title: GINGER GINGER CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      3 c  Flour; all-purpose, sifted
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      6 oz Candied ginger (abt 3/4 cup)
  3 1/2 oz Ginger; fresh *
      8 oz Butter; unsalted (2 sticks)
  2 3/4 c  Sugar; granulated
      6 x  Eggs; large, separated
      1 c  Sour cream
 
  Adjust a rack 1/3 up from bottom of oven and preheat oven to 350F.
  Butter a 10x4 1/4-inch angel food tube pan (it may be a 1 piece
  non-stick pan) with an 18 cup capacity; butter pan even if it has a
  non-stick finish. Dust it all over with fine, dry bread crumbs,
  invert over paper and shake out excess crumbs and set the pan aside.
  Sift together the flour and baking soda and set aside. Cut the
  candied ginger into 1/4 to 1/3-inch pieces and set aside.  Grate the
  fresh ginger and set aside. In the large bowl of an electric mixer,
  beat butter until soft. Gradually beat in the grated fresh ginger and
  2 1/4 cups of the sugar (reserving the remaining half cup). Then,
  beat in the egg yolks. On low speed, gradually add the sifted dry
  ingredients in two additions, alternately with the sour cream in one
  addition.  Remove the bowl from the mixer.  Stir in half of the
  diced, candied ginger (reserve the remainder). Set aside. In the
  small bowl of the electric mixer (with clean beaters) beat the egg
  whites until they hold a soft shape. Reduce the speed to moderate and
  gradually add remaining half cup of sugar. Then increase the speed
  again and beat only until the whites hold a peak when the beaters are
  withdrawn. In three additions, fold the whites into the batter; with
  the first 2 additions, fold only partially, don't be too thorough and
  with the last addition, do not fold more than necessary to
  incorporate the whites. Turn into the prepared pan and smooth the
  top. Sprinkle the reserved candied ginger on top. Bake for about 1
  hour, or, until a cake tester inserted gently into the cake comes out
  clean.  (The cake will not rise to the top of the pan). Let the cake
  cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes. (The cake will sink about 1
  inch as it cools).  Then cover the pan with the cakeplate and,
  holding the pan the plate firmly together, turn them over and remove
  the pan and let the cake cool.  This is a Maida Haetter recipe. *a

 Categories: Cheesecakes, Party, Holiday
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           -NANCY BERRY   (CWBJ78A)

MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      1 c  Fine graham cracker crumbs
           -(about 8 full crackers)
      1 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter; cold
           -cut into 1/4 inch pieces

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Cream cheese; at room temp.
    1/2 c  Honey
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2    Large eggs; at room temp.
  1 1/4 c  Sour cream
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    2/3 c  Golden raisins
           -finely minced
      1 tb Candied ginger; OR MORE
           -(to taste) finely minced
 
  Here's the recipe you wanted from Ken Haedrich's Home For the Holidays
  cookbook.
   Butter the sides only of an 8-in. springform pan. Make the crust by
  mixing the cracker crumbs and 1 T. sugar in a bowl. Add the butter
  and rub it in until all of the crumbs are dampened by the fat.
  Distribute the crumbs loosely but evenly in the pan and press them in
  ; pushing them slightly up the sides. Cover and chill while you make
  the filling; preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric
  mixer, cream the cream cheese, honey, and sugar until light and
  fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then add the remaining
  ingredients and continue to beat until evenly blended; use the
  greater amount of ginger if you want a pronounced ginger flavor, the
  lesser amount for a subtle effect. Scrape the filling into the pan
  and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool the cake thoroughly on a
  rack--it will take several hours--then cover, still in the pan, and
  refrigerate for 12 hours before unmolding and slicing.
  
  Note: Ken Haedrich writes, "I have played around some with baking
  cheesecakes in a water bath, curious to see if it made any difference
  in the final cake. It seems to improve the texture a little bit,
  making it creamier. And I'm not sure if this is just a coincidence,
  but my water bath cakes don't split on top after they come out of the
  oven, perhaps Formatted by Elaine Radis

  * Magee said she'd probably use more.
  
  In pan, simmer 1/2 c. water, 1/3 c. sugar and fresh ginger for 3-4
  minutes, stirring occasionally.  Set aside to cool 5 minutes. (This
  is called a simple syrup.)
  
  In another pan, scald milk and cream (don't boil). Remove from heat
  and stir in remaining sugar and the syrup. Set aside 15 minutes to
  allow flavors blend.
  
  Strain ginger solids from milk mixture. Whisk in egg yolks and
  crystallized ginger.  Return to heat (use either a double boiler or
  heat diffuser.) Heat gently, stirring constantly, until it becomes a
  thin custard. Don't allow it to simmer or boil. It should coat the
  back of a spoon.
  
  Cool mixture and freeze according to your machine's instructions.

      Title: GINGER OIL
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See dir
 
  Ginger oil can be made quickly by putting twelve slices of ginger and
  a half cup of peanut oil in a small frying pan and cooking over
  medium heat until the ginger is browned and the oil is almost
  smoking. Remove the pan from the heat and take out the ginger; what
  remains is a tasty oil that you can use to dress pasta or make into a
  sauce for fish. For a spicier oil, add a few whole, dried hot peppers
  with the ginger. For the simplest sauce made from ginger oil, just
  whisk in two tablespoons of soy sauce (I like Kikkoman's best). This
  quantity is enough to sauce about two pounds of fish fillets--salmon,
  tuna,or whitefish. For a light main dish, poach the fish--and add a
  few thin slices of ginger to the poaching liquid. (By Jackie Shen)

 Categories: Beverages, African, Vegetarian
      Yield: 3 Quarts
 
      6 c  -Boiling water
      1 c  Ginger root;fresh, peeled &
           -grated
      1 c  Sugar
      2 ts Cloves, whole

      1 c  Orange orange
      8 c  -Cool water
 
  "Many variations of homemade ginger beers (soft drinks) are brewed
  all over subSaharan Africa. Fresh ginger makes a spicy drink, cooling
  in summer, warming in winter and always refreshing and energizing.
  Fruit juices other than the citrus called for below, make interesting
  variations in its flavour. When using other juices, I always add the
  juice of a couple of lemons or limes. This recipe makes a concentrate
  that can be diluted with plain or sparkling water."
  
  Pour the boiling water over the grated ginger root, sugar, cloves and
  cinnamon in a large nonreactive pot or bowl (enamel, glass or
  stainless steel). Cover and set aside in a warm place, in the sun if
  possible , for at least an hour. Strain the liquid through a fine
  sieve or cloth. Add the juices and water. Set aside in a warm place
  for another hour or so. Gently strain the liquid again, taking care
  not to disturb the sediment at the bottom. Store in the refrigerator
  in a large nonreactive container. A glass gallon jar or jug works
  well. Serve warm, chilled or on ice, either as is or diluted with
  water or sparkling water. A squeeze of fresh lime juice in each glass
  of ginger drink is "the cat's meow".

 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1 lb Tofu, firm
  1 1/2 ts Ginger, fresh; grated
      1 ts Roasted sesame oil
      1    Garlic clove (or more);
           -minced
      2 tb Tamari, or more to taste
  1 1/4 c  ;water
  1 1/2 tb Arrowroot
 
   Slice the tofu into small rectangles of 1/4--1/2-inch thickness and
  place them in a shallow dish or baking pan.

  this mixture over the tofu and let itmarinate for at least 30
  minutes. (If desired, the tofu may be placed in the refrigerator to
  marinate for several hours or overnight).
  
   Remove the marinated tofu from the liquid, reserving the liquid to
  make the sauce. Place the tofu on a well-oiled cookie sheet and bake
  at 375 deg for 35-40 mintues, or until the desired crispness is
  reached (the longer the tofu bakes the firmer and crisper it becomes).
  
   To make the sauce, mix the arrowroot with the marinade. Place the
  mixture in asmall saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring
  constantly, until thickened.
  
   Ginger Tofu may be served with or without the sauce.
   With the sauce, serve it over a bed of rice, millet, buckwheat, or
  pasta. Add your favorite stir-fried veggies and you have a colorful
  or nutritious meal.

           -----chocolate coating-----
      8 oz Semisweet or bittersweet cho
      2 ts Vegetable shortening
 
  Recipe by: Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library - Cookies & Preparation
  Time: on T
     Preheat oven to 350~. Line 2 large, heavy baking sheets with
  aluminum foil. Lightly butter foil.
     Combine cream, granulated sugar, brown sugar and butter in a heavy
  saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until
  sugars dissolve and butter melts. Add almonds, flour, ginger, and
  orange and lemon zests. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly.
  Remove from heat.
     Drop 1 tablespoon batter (batter will be runny) onto a prepared
  baking sheet. Repeat five times, spacing cookies 3 inches apart.
  Repeat with second baking sheet.
     Bake until deep brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Using a
  round cookie cutter or a glass 3 inches in diameter, push hot cookie
  edges in toward center to neaten them, shaping into 3-inch rounds.
  Slide foil off sheets. Line the same sheets with new foil, butter
  foil and repeat with remaining batter.
     Cool cookies completely on the foil. Carefully peel cookies off
  foil and arrange them smooth-side up on the baking sheets. Spoon 1
  teaspoon of the hot chocolate coating in center of each and, using a
  small icing spatula or knife, spread to edges. Refrigerate until
  chocolate is set, about 30 minutes. Store layered between waxed paper
  in airtight container in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
     Makes about 2 dozen.
  
     CHOCOLATE COATING:  Combine chocolate and shortening in top of
  double boiler. Melt over (not touching) water just until smooth,
  stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Alternatively, melt
  chocolate and shortening in heatproof bowl placed over (not touching)
  simmering water. Dip one flat side of biscotti into warm chocolate or
  spread like icing. Refrigerate until chocolate sets.
     Makes about 3/4 cup.

      Title: GINGER-BANANA CHUTNEY
 Categories: Relishes, Jams
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Onions, chopped
      6    Ripe bananas, put through a
           Food mill
    3/4 lb Pitted dates, chopped
  1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
    1/4 lb Crystallized ginger, minced
    1/2 lb Raisins, chopped
      2 c  Fresh or unsweetened canned
           Pineapple juice
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Curry powder
 
  Most people think of Trinidad, Guyana, and Martinique when they think
  of East Indian influences on Caribbean cooking. Jamaica, however, has
  had its share of that influence as well, as proved by this chutney
  that is prepared from bananas and ginger. Makes about 3 1/2 cups.
  Place the onions, bananas, dates, and vinegar in a nonreactive
  saucepan. Stir them to mix well and cook over low heat for 20
  minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and stir to make sure they are
  well combined. Continue to cook until the chutney has a jamlike
  consistency. Remove from the heat and place in sterilized jars. This
  chutney can accompany cold meats, grilled meats and, of course,
  curries. It will keep for 3 weeks in the refrigerator.

    1/4 lb Sirloin steak, shredded
      1 md Onion, quartered and cut
           -into strips
      1    Thumb-size piece fresh
           -ginger, peeled and

      1    Clove garlic, minced
           Marinade (in jar)
      2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Vegetable sauce
      1 ts Dark soy sauce
      1 ts Dry sherry or rice wine
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Baking powder
      2 ts Cornstarch
      1 tb Water
 
  NOTES: Thanks to reader Alice Ho, here's a ginger beef recipe that's
  stir fried not deep fried. If you partially freeze the beef, it can
  be cut into thin shreds making it quick work in a wok or wide
  skillet. Marinating the meat and cooking it, still partially frozen,
  keeps more of the meat juices in the meat and out of the sauce. For
  dessert, a tropical mixture of lichees, mandarins and grapes would be
  refreshing. If you thought soy sauce was soy sauce, Alice Ho offers
  these tips : "Black and light soy sauces are distinguishable. If you
  shake the light sauce, the bottle is transparent. This is easier than
  deciphering the chinese characters on the bottles." Ho says the
  baking powder in this recipe acts as a meat tenderizer.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Cut beef into shreds, while partially frozen. Use a sharp
  cleaver or chef's knife.  Prepare onion, pepper, ginger and garlic;
  set aside.
  
  Pour marinade ingredients (mixed together) over beef and let stand
  for 30 minutes (longer if you wish).
  
  Heat wok or wide skillet; add 2 Tb vegetable oil.  Fry onion and
  pepper in hot oil, stirring constantly.  Add salt and pepper to
  taste, and cook for a minute. Vegetables should be crisp and
  glistening. Remove from pan.
  
  Add another 2 Tb oil to the pan; heat and add garlic and ginger.
  
  Add beef, stirring quickly to separate strips that cling together.
  
  Add 1/4 cup hot water; stir and cook for about a minute. Return cooked
  vegetables to wok and blend quickly.
  
  Season to taste, as you wish, or add 1 Tb oyster sauce to enhance the
  flavor.  Serve over hot steaming rice. Serves 2. Offer a second
  stir-fry dish to round out the meal.

  Blend the water and spices (except the fennel seeds) into a paste.
  Heat some oil in a pan  (I use a wok.) When hot, put in the fennel
  seeds, and then the paste. Fry the paste for a few minutes (donUt
  lean over the pan and inhale too deeply.) Add the potatoes and fry
  until encrusted with the paste.
  
  Potatoes can also be cooked in the basic hash-brown method, or boiled
  or steamed, or baked, or cooked with a bchamel sauce, or mashed, or
  whatever.
  
  This is unquestionably one of the best potato recipes ever. It comes

  Grease (use shortening) a 9x9x2 inch baking pan or 5 (12 oz) Kerr
  Quilted Crystal Jelly Jars (#14400-80400)--they MUST have straight
  sides, no buldges in the jars. Also, the jars will have to be
  sterilized first--boil them for 10 minutes, leave the lids and rings
  in the water until you're ready to use them; remove the jars and
  allow them to air-dry and cool before greasing. Use a pastry brush to
  grease the jars. DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret!
  
  In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
  salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Stir in margarine, water and
  molasses until well blended. Pour into prepared pan or divide equally
  among the 5 jars. Place jars on a cookie sheet or they'll tip over.
  
  PAN METHOD: Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 40-50 minutes or
  until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool slightly
  on wire rack.
  
  JAR METHOD: Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 35-40 minutes or
  until cake tester inserted deep into the center of each jar comes out
  clean. Have your lids ready (HOT). Take one jar at a time from the
  oven (USE HEAVY DUTY MITTS--the jars ARE HOT!) and place a lid on,
  then the ring. Tightly screw on lids. Allow to cool on your counter
  top. You'll know when the jars have sealed, you'll hear a "plinking"
  sound. If you don't hear the sound, wait until the jars have cooled,
  then press down on the jar lids, they shouldn't move at all. Lynn

      Title: GINGERBREAD BAKED IN JARS
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
    3/4 c  Margarine, softened
    3/4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Molasses
 
    Preheat oven to 325-degrees (NO higher).
  
    Sterilize 5 (12 oz) Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400-81400) jam/jelly
  canning jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Remove
  the jars from the water and allow them to air-dry on your counter
  top; leave the lids and rings in the hot water until you're ready to
  use them.
  
    Once the jars are cool enough to handle, use a pastry brush to
  grease them with shortening (DO NOT use butter, margarine, PAM or
  Baker's Secret); set aside.
  
    In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder,
  salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Stir in margarine, water and
  molasses until well blended. Divide batter among the 5 jars (they
  should be about 1/2 full). Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll
  tip over.
  
    Bake in preheated 325-degree oven for 35 minutes or until cake
  tester inserted in center comes out clean. Move the jars around in
  the oven while they're baking, so they'll bake evenly.
  
    Have your HOT lids ready. Using HEAVY-DUTY MITTS (the jars ARE
  HOT!) Take one jar at a time from the oven and place a lid on, then
  the ring. Tightly screw on lids--do it FAST because the lid gets REAL
  hot! Allow jars to cool on your countertop.
  
    Once the jars are cool, decorate with round pieces of cloth.
  Unscrew the ring (the lid should be sealed by now) and place a few
  cotton balls or a wad of batting on top of the lid (makes it poof-y
  on top), then a piece of cloth (about 3" larger than the lid) on top
  and screw the ring back on. Decorate as desired. I used pinking
  shears to cut the cloth rounds out, otherwise some material will
  start to unravel. A hot glue gun is INVALUABLE--glue on dried
  flowers, bows, ribbons, etc.

      Title: GINGERBREAD BISCOTTI
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      1 c  Almonds, blanched
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 lb Butter
    1/2 c  Molasses, dark
    1/4 c  Ginger, fresh; minced
      3    Egg
      3 c  Flour
    1/2 tb Baking powder
      1 tb Cinnamon, ground
      1 ts Nutmeg, ground
    1/2 ts Cloves, ground
    1/2 ts Allspice, ground
 
  Place almonds in a 8 to 9 inch square pan.  Bake in a 350 F. oven
  until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.  Let cool, coarsely chop, and set
  aside. In large bowl of an electric mixer, beat sugar, butter,
  molasses, and ginger until smooth.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating
  after each addition. In a bowl, stir flour, baking powder, cinnamon,
  nutmeg, cloves, allspice and almonds. Add to egg mixture; stir to
  blend. On two greased 12x15 inch baking sheets, use well-floured
  hands to pat dough into 4 flat loaves, spacing them evenly on sheets;
  each loaf should be about 1/2 inch thick, 2 inches wide and the
  length of the baking sheet. Bake in a 350 F. oven until browned at
  edges and springy to touch, about 25 minutes; switch positions of
  pans halfway through baking. Let loaves stand on baking sheets until
  cool to touch, then cut into long, 1/2-inch thick diagonal slices. On
  baking sheets, arrange slices close together with a cut side down.
  Return to oven and bake at 350 F. until cookies are brown, 15 to 18
  minutes longer; switch positions of pans halfway through baking.
  Transfer biscotti to racks and let cool completely. Serve, or store
  airtight up to 1 month; freeze for longer storage.

      Title: GINGERBREAD BUILDINGS - COUNTRY LIVING
 Categories: Holidays, Decor
      Yield: 3 Buildings
 
           Paper for patterns,
           Cardboard, masking tape,
           Aluminum foil,
           Gingerbread Dough (recipe
           -follows)
           Royal Frosting (recipe
           -follows)
           Candy sticks, hard candy
           "holes"
           Colored sugar, dried fruit,
           Nuts
           Pointed ice cream cone for
           -steeple (opt.)
           Cotton batting and
           Artificial trees
 
  1. Make patterns: From paper, draw and cut out two 6 by 3 1/2-inch
  rectangles; label one "horizontal side" and the other "vertical
  side." Fold the vertical side in half lengthwise to make a 6 by 1
  1/4-inch rectangle. Label one short edge "top" and the other
  "bottom." Along the 6 inch cut edge, measure and mark a point 3
  1/2-inches up from bottom. From that mark, draw and cut a diagonal
  line to the top folded corner. Open pattern.
  
  2. Make cardboard frames: For each building (dough recipe makes 3),
  from cardboard, cut out 2 vertical sides, 2 horizontal sides, one 6
  by 3 1/2-inch rectangle for base, and two 6 1/2 by 3 1/2-inch
  rectangles for roof. Tape sides together (alternating horizontal and
  vertical) and stand up to make a box; tape securely onto base. Tape
  two 6-inch sides of roof pieces together and set aside. (Cardboard
  roof will be frosted and placed last.)
  
  3. Prepare Gingerbread Dough. Heat oven to 350'F. Cover 3 large baking
  sheets with aluminum foil. On prepared sheets, roll out gingerbread
  dough (onethird on each) to 1/8-inch thickness.
  
  4. Using paper patterns as a guide, cut gingerbread to make 2
  horizontal and 2 vertical sides for each building, leaving 1/4 inch
  between pieces. Remove and reroll trimmings; cut out doors, windows,
  window boxes, shutters, signs, and other decorative pieces, as
  illustrated or design your own. Place doors, windows, and other
  decorative pieces on gingerbread sides, making the front of some
  buildings on the horizontal side and some on the vertical side. Using
  knife, score gingerbread pieces to resemble shingles, bricks, or
  stone. Score doors and windows.
  
  5. Bake gingerbread pieces 12 to 15 minutes or until firm and golden
  brown. While still warm, measure against pattems and trim off excess
  caused by expansion during baking. Cool gingerbread on flat surface.
  
  6. Prepare Royal Frosting. Spread some Royal Frosting on cardboard
  frames. Press gingerbread side pieces onto frames. Tie a piece of
  yarn, string, or ribbon around building to hold gingerbread in place
  until secure. Set aside at least 30 minutes.
  
  7. When sides are secure, remove yarn. Set each building on a piece of
  aluminum foil. Stir frosting; spoon some into decorating bag fitted
  with 1/4-inch-wide round or star tip. Pipe a border at all corners of
  buildings, decorate sides with frosting, candy, colored sugar, dried
  fruit, or nuts. Print signs, if desired. Pipe some frosting along top
  edges of sides to attach cardboard roofs; press roofs into place.
  
  8. Generously frost roofs with remaining frosting to cover cardboard.
  Press candy onto roofs to resemble chimneys. Add additional candy
  decorations, if desired. To make church steeple, if desired, cut out
  2 V-shaped openings opposite each other in open end of ice cream
  cone, then place cone over point of roof and secure with frosting.
  Set buildings aside several hours or overnight to dry.
  
  9. Display on cotton batting surrounded by artificial trees.

 Categories: Holidays, Cookies
      Yield: 66 Cookies
 
      5 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Vegetable shortening or
           -margarine
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Light molasses

  1. On waxed paper, combine flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt.
  
  2. In large bowl, with electric mixer, beat shortening and sugar until
  light and fluffy. Beat in molasses and egg. Stir in flour mixture to
  make a stiff dough. Divide dough into thirds; wrap with plastic wrap.
  Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 3 days before using.
  
  3. Heat oven to 350'F. For cut-out cookies, cover 2 or 3 large baking
  sheets with aluminum foil or baking parchment paper. If making cookie
  molds, prepare molds following manufacturer's directions.
  
  4. For cut cookies, on prepared sheet, roll out cookie dough, one
  third at a time, to a 14 by 11-inch rectangle, about 1/8-inch thick.
  Using patterns as a guide or cookie cutters, cut out as many pieces
  as possible, leaving 1/2 inch between pieces. Lift off dough
  trimmings and reserve to roll out later. If hanging cookies, make
  holes in cookies using a straw or skewer.
  
  5. For molded cookies, take a piece of dough and press it firmly and
  evenly into prepared mold. Using rolling pin, roll over dough to fill
  mold evenly. Using a sawing motion with a sharp knife, trim the back
  of cookie so it is flush with the mold. Unmold cookie mold onto
  prepared sheet following manufacturer's directions.
  
  6. Bake small gingerbread pieces 8 to 10 minutes, 12 to 15 minutes for
  larger pieces, or 15 to 20 minutes for the molds. Cookies should be
  firm and golden brown. Transfer cookies to wire racks; cool
  completely before decorating. Store cookies in airtight containers.

  Gingerbread from Lucerne, the story:
  
  There has always been a place for gingerbread on market stalls and at
  fairs. It was customary for a young man to offer his sweetheart a
  gingerbread cake, which she would acceptwith delight. Since the Middle
  Ages, Lucerne has seen the creation of a large number of such
  delicacies influenced by its governors and merchants.
  
  The recipe:
  
  Add the lemon juice to the cream and leave for a few minutes. Mix
  together the cream, pear puree sugar, mixed spices and bicarbonate of
  soda. Add the flour. Mix until well blended and then add the nuts.
  
  Fill a flan ring (24 cm diameter, 6 cm high) and bake in the oven for
  50 minutes at 190 oC.
  
  Serve cold.

      Yield: 60 Cookies
 
  4 1/2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 ts Ground ginger
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Vegetable shortening
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Light molasses
      1 lg Egg
           About 14 yards 1/4 or 1/8
           -inch-wide red ribbon (opt.)
 
  1. In medium-size bowl, combine flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and
  salt.
  
  2. In large bowl, with electric mixer on medium speed, beat
  shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in molasses and
  egg. With mixer on low speed, beat in flour mixture to make a stiff
  dough. Shape dough into 3 equal balls; wrap and set aside until ready
  to roll out.
  
  3. Heat oven to 350'F. Lightly grease and flour 2 baking sheets.
  Between 2 pieces of floured waxed paper, roll out one ball of dough
  to about 1/4-inch thickness. Remove top piece of paper. With 3 inch
  heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out as many hearts as possible and
  place about 1/2-inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Press together
  dough trimmings and reroll to cut out more hearts. If making cookies

  inch from center top of each cookie.
  
  4. Bake gingerbread hearts 12 to 15 minutes or until firm and golden
  brown. While still warm, check holes and reopen, if necessary. Cool
  gingerbread on wire racks. Repeat rolling, cutting, and baking until
  all dough has been used. If desired, thread an 8-inch piece of ribbon
  through the hole of each and tie. Hang cookie hearts on tree, or
  store in airtight containers to serve later.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 c  Melted solid Crisco
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Light or dark Karo
      2 x  Large eggs
  5 3/4 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Ginger

  Karo, blending well. Add eggs, mixing all until smooth and creamy.
  Put salt, baking soda and spices into mixture and begin to add flour,
  just a little at a time. DON'T HURRY THIS STEP! Continue adding as
  much flour as the dough will absorb. Bake house pieces at 375 degrees
  for 5-8 minutes. Hints: Make permenant pattern pieces of mylar or
  other plastic sheet. To roll out: Use heavy duty foil (splash a few
  drops of water under it so it will stay stationary), roll the dough
  out, cut into desired shapes that are 1" apart. Remove the excess
  dough. Place the foil holding the pieces to bake on a cardboard,
  place in oven and REMOVE THE CARDBOARD BEFORE SHUTTING OVEN DOOR. If
  pieces bake together, cut apart immedietely after removing from oven.
  Windows: Must be cut before baking. Can add crushed hard candy for
  "glass" To Assemble" Use royal Icing: 1 1/2 c warm water, 12 Tbsps
  Meringue powder, 4 pounds powdered sugar. Beat the water and
  mer.powder til frothy. Add as much p. sugar as necassary. Do not make
  icing stiff or house will not hold together as long. Using #5 tip,
  squeeze out icing on both sides of back of house. Stand it up and add
  sides. Prop with cans of soup, ect., if it doesn't stay firmly
  together. Place icing on ends of standing sides and add house front.
  Let dry for 10-15 minutes, then add roof and chimney. Decorate with
  desired candies using royal icing to place decorations on. Let dry
  and store covered away from dust. Source: an out-of-print book,

  together in a large bowl.  Mix moist ingredients in a blender and
  then add to dry ingredients. Pour batter into muffin pans lined with
  paper baking cups.  Bake about 13 minutes.

      Title: GINGERBREAD TEDDY BEARS
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      1 c  Butter (or margarine)
    2/3 c  Brown sugar
    2/3 c  Corn syrup and/or molasses
      4 c  Flour
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Ginger
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
    3/4 ts Baking soda
      1    Egg; lightly beaten
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
 
    In a saucepan combine butter, brown sugar and corn syrup. Cook and
  stir
    over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Pour into large mixing
  bowl; cool
    5 minutes. Sift together flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and baking
  soda.
    Add egg and vanilla to butter mixture; mix well. Add flour mixture;
  beat
    til well mixed. Divide dough in half, cover and chill 2 hours or
    overnight. For each bear, shape dough into one 1-inch ball, one
  3/4-inch
    ball, six 1/2-inch balls and one 1/4-inch ball. On ungreased cookie
  sheet
    flatten the 1-inch ball to 1/2" thickness for body. Attach the
  3/4-inch
    ball for head and flatten to 1/2" thickness. Attach the 1/2-inch
  balls for
    arms, legs and ears. Attach the 1/4-inch ball for nose. Bake at 350
    degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, cool and decorate. I usually make these
    smaller than described here; about 1/2 the size. Also, the ears
  start to
    look like MOUSE ears if they're not a little smaller than the arms
  and
    legs. Roll the nose ball to make it more oval in shape and place it
  on the
    LOWER half of the bear's face. These can be decorated with any
  icing-- I
    use tinted Royal icing made from meringue powder to add eyes, nose
  and bow
    tie to each bear. For Easter, make these into bunnies. Use only
  light corn
    syrup, no molasses. Substitute white sugar for the brown sugar. Omit
    spices and add a bit of almond extract if desired. Make them the
  same way,
    but make two long ears on the top and two cheek-balls instead of the
    nose-ball. Decorate with pastel icings.       Karen Mintzias TCVC49A

 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Garden Sausage (Wholesome &
           Hearty Foods, INc.>
           Fresh hot-tasting powdered
           Ginger
        x  Kikkoman lite soy sauce
      1 pk Won ton wrappers
        x  A few Chinese style pea
           Pods
 
  Warm 4 patties at a time in the microwave for about 30 seconds, which
  is hopefully time enough to thaw them but not make them too hot to
  handle. Lay out several won ton wrappers, then put a little wad of
  the Garden Sausage (I got about 6 dumplings per patty) in the center
  of each wrapper. Sprinkle with ginger and soy sauce. I put a little
  slice of pea pod in about 1/2 of the dumplings just to make it more
  interesting.
  
  Pinch the won ton wrappers closed at the top.  Put as many as will
  fit side by side into a steamer basket in a sauce pan (at least
  that's how I did it because the rice steamer was occupado) with a
  little boiling water in the bottom.  Cover and steam for 5+ minutes.
  The won ton wrappers I used came covered in a little flour and I
  figured that when the wrappers looked moist rather than floury they
  were done.
  
  Serve with little dishes of hot Asian-style mustard and /or light soy
  sauce.

      Title: GINSENG SHREDS STIR RICE - FOR A SPECIAL MEAL
 Categories: Chinese, Rice, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      9 c  Pre steamed rice
      2    Ounces finely chopped
           -Ginseng
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 ts Salt
      3    Onions shredded
      3    Sweet peppers shredded
      1 lb Celery
 
  Steam and simmer rice.  Use 1 heaping tablespoon vegetable oil and
  stir rice in a skillet over a big fire for 1 or 2 minutes. Take out
  the rice.
  
  Heat the remaining vegetable oil over a big fire until hot. Put in
  finely chopped Ginseng, onions, peppers, celery and salt and stir for
  2 minutes. Let sit, covered, for 7 minutes. Then it's ready.
  
  Almost all Chinese soups and stews are adaptable to Ginseng, with the
  exception of those having citrus fruits as an ingredient. I've given
  you a start here, but experiment. Dig up a Chinese cookbook and try
  out a few recipes.

      Title: GIRARDET'S LYONNAISE POTATOES
 Categories: Potatoes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    500 g  New potatoes; 1 lb 2 oz
    100 g  Onions; 3 1/2 oz
      2 tb Oil
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Note - This dish is simple enough as long as your frying pan is very
  large, the oil is very hot and the potatoes are cooked in one layer
  only.
  
  Preparation
  
  Peel the potatoes and slice them finely - 2mm (1/16 in) thick - with a
  mandoline. A food processor will do as well, as long as the slices are
  thin.
  
  Peel the onions. Slice them finely too, and separate the rings in each
  slice.
  
  Finishing
  
  Heat the oil in a large frying pan.
  
  Season the potatoes and onions.
  
  Put the slices of potato into the pan first and saute them quickly,
  turning them over several times, for 2 minutes. Add the onions and
  continue cooking, still stirring and turning, for 3-4 minutes more,
  until both potatoes and onions are crisp and golden.

      1 ts -salt
      1 tb Sugar;granulated
    1/4 c  Shortening or lard
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 c  Milk
 
  *Canadian all purpose flour is very hard; the American equilvant is
  bread flour This recipes comes from the town of Fergus, Ontario,
  founded by two Scots in the 1880s. A girdle is a large cast iron pan.
  
  Heat flat cast iron pan on low heat for 10 to 15 minutes or until
  hot. (To test, sprinkle with a little flour; if it browns in 10 to 15
  seconds, the pan is hot enough.) Meanwhile in a large mixing bowl,
  stir flour, baking powder, salt and sugar; with fingertips, rub in
  shortening or lard till crumbly. Whisk egg with 1 cup of the milk.
  Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients; pour in the liquid.
  With wooden spoon, stir to make soft, but not sticky dough, adding
  more milk as needed. Turn out onto floured board, knead 3 or 4 times.
  Pat or roll to no more than 1/4 - 1/2 inch. With sharp knife, cut
  into small triangles. Place a few at a time on pan; cook, rotating
  scones occasionally for 5 to 6 minutes or until bottoms are browned.
  Serve hot. MAKES: approx 2 DOZEN

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz Flour
    1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 oz Butter

           Buttermilk, Or
           Full cream milk OR
           Sour milk
 
  Tip:- To test for the correct heat of the girdle sprinkle it with a
  little flour. If the flour browns at once it is too hot; it should
  take a few seconds to turn colour.
  
  Sift the flour into a bowl. Add the other dry ingredients and mix.
  Rub in the butter. Add the syrup and sufficient milk and mix with a
  palette knife to a soft consistency. Turn On to a floured surface and
  roll quickly and lightly (handle as little as posible) to about 1/4
  inch thick. Cut in rounds. Grease and heat the gridle and, with a
  slice or broad knife, turn once until brown on both sides. Serve

 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
    1/2 c  Banana liqueur
      1 ts Unflavored gelatin
  2 3/4 c  Heavy cream
    1/2    Vanilla bean
           4 egg yolks
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      3 tb Cornstarch
           3 ripe bananas
           Juice of 1 lemon
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/2 c  Mini chocolate chips
           Baked Pie Crust
  1 1/2 c  Bourbon Chocolate Mousse
      1 pk Do-Si-Dos cookies, crushed
           Whipped cream for garnish
 
  Place the banana liqueur in a small mixing bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin
  on top and allow to soften for 5 minutes. Place the bowl over
  simmering water until the gelatin is completely clear. Set aside.
  
  In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream and vanilla bean. Bring to a
  boil, remove from heat, cover and allow to steep while preparing the
  yolk mixture.
  
  In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks while gradually adding sugar.
  When the yolks have lightened, whisk in cornstarch. Strain the cream
  and allow it  to cool slightly. Gradually pour it into the yolk
  mixture while stirring.  Return to a clean saucepan over medium heat
  and stir constantly until the  mixture begins to boil. Reduce the
  heat and continue to stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, whisk
  in the gelatin mixture and incorporate thoroughly. Allow the pastry
  cream to cool completely.
  
  Slice two of the bananas on the bias and brush with lemon juice.
  Spread peanut butter on bottom of Baked Pie Crust, then spread
  Chocolate Mousse on top of peanut butter, then top with a layer of
  bananas and about 1/3 cup cookie crumbles. Top with banana custard.
  Just before serving, top with 1/3 cup of cookie crumbles and
  chocolate chips. With pastry bag, pipe whipped cream on pie. Slice
  the third banana (you may not need all of it) and arrange slices on
  top in a circle, then sprinkle with chocolate chips and additional
  cookie crumbles.
  
  This makes a very rich pie; thin slices are called for.
  
  You will have leftover banana-flavored pastry cream, which you could
  pour into tart shells or layer with the leftover crumbles in tall
  parfait glasses,  topped with additional chocolate chips, cookie
  crumbles and whipped cream.

           -chocolate chips
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-11-inch pan about 2 inches
  deep, then line it with baking parchment. Process the Samoas cookies
  and the graham cracker crumbs in a food processor, then add the
  melted margarine. Pat this  mixture into the bottom of the pan.
  
  Melt the semi-sweet chocolate and the butter together in one pan. In
  another pan, combine the corn syrup and the sugar; heat until smooth.
  Then add  it to the chocolate mix.
  
  Add eggs to the mixture. Combine pecan halves and the small chocolate
  chips to the mixture. Pour into crust and bake for 45 minutes to an

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 ga Wine, red (vin ordinaire)
      8 fl Brandy/vodka
      1 c  Sugar
      3 tb Lemon juice
      1 pn Cardamom
      6    Cinnamon stick
      6 sl Lemon; 5mm thick
      1    Bay leaf
 
  Chuck all ingredients in large pot EXCEPT for the sugar. Cover, simmer
  gently for 10 mins, taste.  Now add 2 teaspoons of sugar per person
  (level, NOT heaped). Simmer for 10 mins.
  
  Place lemon slices in glass mugs and ladle the concoction into
  glasses. The lemon must float. If not, discard lemon and cut new
  slices. The secret is to drink the hot mixture through the lemon; it
  gives a very distinctive flavour.
  
  CAUTION:  DO NOT ALLOW THE MIXTURE TO BOIL!!!! After all, you
  wouldn't want all that alcohol to evaporate, would you?

      Title: GLACE BEEF LA LOUISANNE
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    3 lb. rump roast
           MARINADE:
      1 c  Whiskey or bourbon
    1/2 c  Honey
    1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 c  Natural tenderizer - papaya
           Or peach juice
      1 tb Finely ground black pepper
           FILLING:
    1/2 c  Finely chopped walnuts and
           Pistachio nuts
      1 c  Broccoli tips, steamed until
           Soft
 
  1. Carefully trim excess fat and then cut the rump so it forms a long
  strip (about 1/2 inch thick) and the width of the rump roast.
  
  2. Carefully smooth the black pepper thoroughly over all the stripped
  rump roast.  Set the roast in a shallow pan (large enough to hold
  roast) and smother roast in marinade. Cover and chill for several
  hours, the longer the better.
  
  3. Unroll the stripped rump roast and fill with the nut and broccoli
  tips. Roll the roast and tie well so filling does not fall out. Place
  on a rotisserie. Use the marinade to baste. Cook for at least 2
  hours. Remove from spit and remove ties.
  
  Serving suggestion: Slice thin and serve on a bed of mixed rice,
  onions, and carrots.

  thoroughly until a smooth paste is obtained.
  
  Pour into a buttered and floured cake tin and leave to prove in a warm
  place for about 1 hour.
  
  Brush the cake with beaten egg and bake in the oven at 180 oC for

      Title: GLAZED ALMOND BRIE
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs, Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
  1 3/4 oz Wheel imported Brie cheese
           - well chilled
      2 tb Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 c  Sliced unblanched almonds
           Red & green seedless grapes
           - in clusters, for garnish
 
  WITH A SMALL, flexible knife, cut away rind from top of chilled
  cheese. Be careful not to remove or split the rind on the sides. It
  will form a wall for the melted cheese. Sift 1 tablespoon of
  confectioners' sugar evenly over the surface and arrange almonds on
  top, pressing gently into place. The cheese can be prepared to this
  point as many as 2 days in advance. Cover loosely with foil and
  refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before heating, place rack 6
  inches from heat source and preheat the broiler. Line large baking
  sheet with aluminum foil, place cheese on it and sift 1 tablespoon of
  confectioners' sugar over nuts. Broil cheese until top is evenly
  browned--about 1 to 2 minutes. Rotate cheese, if necessary, for even
  browning. Watch carefully so it does not burn. Use foil to lift
  cheese and transfer it to serving platter. Tear foil and gently
  remove it. Garnish with clusters of grapes. Volume I of Abby Mandel's

      Title: GLAZED APPLE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Mc Intosh apples; about
           -1 1/2 lb., cored and cut
           -into quarters
    1/4 c  -Water
      1    Lemon peel; fresh, 2" strip
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter; softened
      1 c  Sugar
      1    Large egg
  2 1/4 c  All purpose flour
      2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg; fresh grated
    1/4 ts Cloves; ground
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Pecans; finely chopped,
           -toasted
      2    Granny Smith apples
    1/4 c  Apricot jam; strained

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           -Whipped cream; optional
 
  In a large saucepan combine the McIntosh apples with the water and
  lemon peel, bring the water to a boil and simmer the apples, covered,
  for 20 minutes, or until tender. Cook the mixture, uncovered, over
  moderately high heat, stirring, until the water is almost evaporated.
  Force the mixture through a food mill into a bowl, and allow the
  puree to cool. (I zap it in my food processor, until it is a puree).
  
   Generously butter a 9" springform pan and preheat the oven to 350
  deg. F. In a large bowl cream the butter, beat in the sugar and beat
  the mixture until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and the apple
  puree. Into a bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon,
  nutmeg, cloves and salt. Stir the flour mixture and the pecans gently
  into the apple mixture and pour the batter into the springform pan.
  Peel and core the Granny Smith apples, halve them lengthwise and cut
  them crosswise into thin slices. *Arrange the apple slices
  decoratively in bunches on the batter, pressing them lightly into the
  batter.
   Bake the cake in the middle of the oven for 1 1/4 hours, or until a
  cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cake
  to a rack.
  
  In a small saucepan melt the jam over low heat, brush it over the
  cake and let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes. Run a
  sharp knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake and remove
  the sides of the pan.  Serve the cake warm or at room temperature
  with the whipped cream, if desired.  Note: If you prefer, substitute
  3 large firm pears to make the fruit puree.  Use 2 firm but ripe
  unpeeled pears, halved lengthwise, cored and cut into thin slices for
  the top of the cake.
  
  Note:* You should be able to make about 14 groups bunches of the
  sliced Granny Smith Apples, and arrange them in 12 groups around the
  cake, with two groups in the center, sort of like a flower. Press the
  slices in, keeping the round side of the slices up, and pressing them
  straight into the batter. This is a lovely looking cake. I have only
  made it once...it was quite simple, yet very elegant looking and
  different.

    225 g  Carrots; trimmed
           - (sliced on the diagonal
           - 0.5 cm (1/4 inch) thick)
     25 g  Unsalted butter*
    150 ml Vegetable stock
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Fresh minced parsley
      1 ts Fresh dill, finely chopped
           Salt and pepper
 
  *(Vegans use vegan margarine or oil instead of butter)
  
  A classic way of cooking carrots, particulary good in summer using
  fresh baby carrots and parsley from the garden.
  
  Cook the carrots in boiling salted water for 5 minutes, or until they
  are just tender. Drain them in a colander, and refresh them under
  running cold water. In a frying-pan toss the carrots in the butter
  over moderate heat until they are well coated. Add the stock, sugar,
  and salt and pepper to taste, and cook the mixture over a moderately
  high heat, tossing the carrots, until the liquid is reduced to a
  glaze. Stir in the parsley and the dill. Serve hot.

MMMMM-------------------------MAIN DISH------------------------------
      2    Rock Cornish game hens
           -(1 lb. each)
    1/4 c  Corn syrup
      1 tb Prepared mustard
           -(Dijon or spicy)
      1 sm Garlic clove
           -peeled and finely chopped
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
           -(reserve other half)
 
  To make the curry powder, grind the spices together until they
  resemble a coarse powder, either with a mortar and pestle or in a
  clean electric coffee grinder.
  
  If the hens are frozen, thaw overnight in refrigerator. Rinse hens
  with cold water; pat dry.
  
  In small bowl, combine curry powder with syrup, mustard, garlic, salt,
  pepper and lemon juice. Preheat oven to 375 F.
  
  Cut reserved lemon half in half again; place inside hens. If desired,
  truss (tie or skewer) hens, to secure legs. Line a shallow roasting
  pan with foil, dull side facing up, for easy cleanup. Place hens in
  pan and brush with some of the glaze. Reserve remainder of glaze for
  frequent basting.
  
  Bake in oven 1 hour or longer, until juices run clear (meat should
  still be juicy.)  Baste often for crispy, golden skin. Halfway
  through baking, cover legs and wing tips with foil to prevent
  scorching.
  
  Serve with rice and stir-fried vegetables.

  muffins. Let muffins cool 2-3 minutes, then brush the tops with the
  warm glaze, or drip it over them with a spoon. Serve warm. Sticky and
  good -- real good!

      Title: GLAZED VENISON PATE
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Venison (trimmed weight)
    1/2 lb Belly of pork (trimmed wt.)
    1/2 lb Chicken livers
      1 sm Orange
      1    Lemon
      2    Garlic cloves
  1 1/2 ts Fresh thyme (more to taste)
           Whole and ground bay leaves
      1 tb Red wine vinegar
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/4 pt Red wine
      1 ts Gelatine powder
           A few kumquats to decorate
 
  Mince all three meats fairly finely and put them into a bowl. Add the
  zest of the orange and lemon, the crushed garlic, the thyme, olive
  oil, vinegar, a generous pinch of powdered bay and plenty of black
  pepper. Mix thoroughly and stir in the wine.  Cover and leave to
  marinate overnight.
  
  Season with salt - I find 1 teaspoon about right but fry a small
  nugget of the mixture to check.  Turn the pate into a terrine of
  about 2 1/4 pint capacity. Pack the mixture well down into the
  corners of the dish and use a spoon to hollow out slightly the centre
  top. Cover with greaseproof paper and foil, stand the dish in a
  roasting pan containing enough hot water to come halfway up the sides
  of the dish.  Bake at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for 2-1/4 to 2-1/2
  hours.
  
  Using a bulb baster, remove and reserve most of the juices that
  surround the pate.  Replace the greaseproof paper and foil, press the
  pate lightly with 1-1/2 to 2 lb weights and cool for 1-1/2 hours.
  Then drain off any remaining juices that have not been re-absorbed by
  the pate. Mix all the venison juices that you have collected with the
  juice of the orange and measure.  Add a splash of water if necessary
  to make 1/2 pint in total. Dissolve the gelatine powder in the
  mixture and use it to glaze the pate, adding a few bay leaves and
  kumquats to decorate if liked.

      Title: GLITSCHER
 Categories: Vegetables, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 md Raw potatoes
  1 3/4 lb Potatoes, boiled in their
           -jackets a day ahead
      3 tb To 4 tb (heaping) flour
      2    Eggs
    1/4 c  Water
           Salt
 
  So called for their well-known propensity to slip ('glitschen') off
  one's plate, 'Glitscher' are also called 'Wetzsteine' (whetstones)
  because they are more or less the same shape (although shorter) as
  the old-fashioned sharpening stones used for a sickle or scythe blade.
  
  Grate the raw potatoes into a bowl full of water, then place in a
  coarse muslin bag or wrap in a rolled-up dishtowel, and wring out
  thoroughly. The boiled potatoes should be cooked a day in advance,
  then peeled and grated on the following day.  Combine the two, along
  with the flour, eggs, and water, and mix thoroughly; season with
  salt. Shape the dumplings with wet hands.  The dumplings should be
  fairly long and pointed at both ends. Cook in simmering salted water
  for about 20 minutes.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

  moisture controls its growth in dried food. High oxygen controls its
  growth in fresh foods.
  
  Canning - A method of preserving food in air-tight vacuum-sealed
  containers and heat processing sufficiently to enable storing the
  food at normal-home temperatures.
  
  Canning salt - Also called pickling salt. It is regular table salt
  without the anticaking or iodine additives.
  
  Citric acid - A form of acid that can be added to canned foods. It
  increases the acidity of low-acid foods and may improve the flavor and
  color.
  
  Cold pack - Canning procedure in which jars are filled with raw food.
  "Raw pack" is the preferred term for describing this practice. "Cold
  pack" is often used incorrectly to refer to foods that are
  open-kettle canned or jars that are heat-processed in boiling water.
  
  Enzymes - Proteins in food which accelerate many flavor, color,
  texture, and nutritional changes, especially when food is cut,
  sliced, crushed, bruised, and exposed to air. Proper blanching or
  hot-packing practices destroy enzymes and improve food quality.
  
  Exhausting - Removal of air from within and around food and from jars
  and canners. Blanching exhausts air from live food tissues.
  Exhausting or venting of pressure canners is necessary to prevent a
  risk of botulism in low-acid canned foods.
  
  Fermentation - Changes in food caused by intentional growth of
  bacteria, yeast, or mold. Native bacteria ferment natural sugars to
  lactic acid, a major flavoring and preservative in sauerkraut and in
  naturally fermented dills. Alcohol, vinegar, and some dairy products
  are also fermented foods.
  
  Headspace - The unfilled space above food or liquid in jars. Allows
  for food expansion as jars are heated, and for forming vacuums as
  jars cool.
  
  Heat processing - Treatment of jars with sufficient heat to enable
  storing food at normal home temperatures.
  
  Hermetic seal - An absolutely airtight container seal which prevents
  reentry of air or microorganisms into packaged foods.
  
  Hot pack - Heating of raw food in boiling water or steam and filling
  it hot into jars.
  
  Low-acid foods - Foods which contain very little acid and have a pH
  above 4.6. The acidity in these foods is insufficient to prevent the
  growth of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Vegetables, some
  tomatoes, figs, all meats, fish, seafoods, and some dairy foods are
  low acid. To control all risks of botulism, jars of these foods must
  be (1) heat processed in a pressure canner, or (2) acidified to a pH
  of 4.6 or lower before processing in boiling water.

      Title: GLOSSARY OF TERMS (M-Z)
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Half
 
 
  Microorganisms - Independent organisms of microscopic size, including
  bacteria, yeast, and mold. When alive in a suitable environment, they
  grow rapidly and may divide or reproduce every 10 to 30 minutes.
  Therefore, they reach high populations very quickly. Undesirable
  microorganisms cause disease and food spoilage. Microorganisms are
  sometimes intentionally added to ferment foods, make antibiotics, and
  for other reasons.
  
  Mold - A fungus-type microorganism whose growth on food is usually
  visible and colorful. Molds may grow on many foods, including acid
  foods like jams and jellies and canned fruits. Recommended heat
  processing and sealing practices prevent their growth on these foods.
  
  Mycotoxins - Toxins produced by the growth of some molds on foods.
  
  Open - Kettle canning A non-recommended canning method. Food is
  supposedly adequately heat processed in a covered kettle, and then
  filled hot and sealed in sterile jars. Foods canned this way have low
  vacuums or too much air, which permits rapid loss of quality in
  foods. Moreover these foods often spoil because they become
  recontaminated while the jars are being filled.
  
  Pasteurization - Heating of a specific food enough to destroy the most
  heat-resistant pathogenic or disease-causing microorganism known to be
  associated with that food.
  
  pH - A measure of acidity or alkalinity. Values range from 0 to 14. A
  food is neutral when its pH is 7.0: lower values are increasingly
  more acidic; higher values are increasingly more alkaline.
  
  Pickling - The practice of adding enough vinegar or lemon juice to a
  low-acid food to lower its pH to 4.6 or lower. Properly pickled foods
  may be safely heat processed in boiling water.
  
  Pressure canner - A specifically designed metal kettle with a
  lockable lid used for heat processing low-acid food. These canners
  have jar racks, one or more safety devices, systems for exhausting
  air, and a way to measure or control pressure. Canners with 20- to
  21-quart capacity are common. The minimum volume of canner that can
  be used is 16-quart capacity, which will contain 7 quart jars. Use of
  pressure saucepans with less than 16-quart capacities is not
  recommended.
  
  Raw pack - The practice of filling jars with raw, unheated food.
  Acceptable for canning low-acid foods, but allows more rapid quality
  losses in acid foods heat processed in boiling water.
  
  Spice bag - A closeable fabric bag used to extract spice flavors in a
  pickling solution.
  
  Style of pack - Form of canned food, such as whole, sliced, piece,
  juice, or sauce. The term may also be used to reveal whether food is
  filled raw or hot into jars.
  
  Vacuum - The state of negative pressure. Reflects how thoroughly air
  is removed from within a jar of processed food--the higher the
  vacuum, the less air left in the jar.
  
  Yeasts - A group of microorganisms which reproduce by budding. They
  are used in fermenting some foods and in leavening breads.

      Title: GLUEHWEIN
 Categories: Beverages, German, Alcohol
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     60 g  Sugar
    1/2    Cinnamon stick
      4    Cloves
           Peel of 1/2 lemon
    1/8 l  Water
      1 l  Red wine
           Juice of 1/2 - 1 lemon
 
  Put cinnamon, cloves and lemon peel in a paper tea filter; tie it
  shut with a piece of white yarn. Together with the water and the
  sugar, bring it to a boil in a pot, let sit for 20 minutes. Take out
  the tea filter, add the red wine and heat. The art is to heat the
  wine up as close to its boiling temperature without ever getting it
  to boil (the most important thing about making gluehwein is that the
  wine must NEVER boil). Finally, add lemon juice to taste.
  
  Possible variations: ~ leave away the lemon juice or use orange juice
  instead ~ leave away the lemon peel ~ instead of boiling the tea
  filter, put it directly into the wine, heat,
    and let soak for 30 - 45 minutes (you don't need the water this
  way); if
    you chop up the ingredients before putting them in the filter, you
  get a
    more intensive flavor ~ add a few drops of vanilla ~ add a little
  cardamom and/or ginger ~ vary the quantities of cinnamon, cloves and
  sugar ~ to get the possibly most famous type of gluehwein, the
  Nuernberger
    Christkindlesmarkt-Gluehwein, use blueberry wine instead of red wine

      Title: GLUTEN FREE BREAD HINTS - BREAD MACHINE
 Categories: Abm, Hints
      Yield: 1 Info sheet
 
 
  From - Bread Machine Baking for Better Health, Maureen Keane and
  Danirlla Chase. ~---- Personal Note: I have not tried any of these
  recipes, but for anyone that is on a restricted diet I would
  recommend that you take a look at this book. I found it at our local
  health food store. ~----
  
  Check your machine's instruction booklet to make sure your machine
  can bake whole grain breads.  Some machines on the market today are
  equipped to make only lighter, white breads. If you bake whole grain
  breads in this type of machine you will eventually wear down the
  motor. Baking Gluten Free Bread in ABM
  
  Since only flours containing no lkiadin and prolamin can be used to
  make bread for people with celiac disease or dermatitis
  herpetiformis, a substitute for gluten must be used to make the dough
  rise. An excellent substitute for gluten is xanthan gum, a natural
  product made from Xanthomomas campestis.  This micro organism is
  grown in the lab for its cell coat, which is dried and ground to form
  xanthan gum. Xantham gum is added as a powder to the dry bread
  ingredients. One teaspoon is needed for every cup of gluten free
  flour. You can buy this product at your local health food store or
  order it from various mail order companies.
  
  Tips for Making Gluten Free Breads
  
  1.  Buy a machine that makes the 1 1/2 pound square type loaf. This
  will enable you to make medium and small size loaves that are easy to
  slice for sandwiches and toast.
  
  2.  Gluten free doughs are sticky and difficult to mix. Help your
  machine by checking on the dough often during the first 5 - 10
  minutes. Scrape down the sides of the pan with a soft rubber spatula.
  
  3.  Gluten free dough does not look like ordinary wheat dough. Gluten
  free doughs require more liquid and in some recipes resemble a batter
  more than a dough. By observing the dough mixing during the first 5 ~
  10 minutes you will get a feel for what the dough should look like
  and be able to adjust the liquid and dry ingredients accordingly.
  
  4.  The dough will mix more readily if you always add the liquid
  ingredients first.  Do this EVEN if your machine recommends that dry
  ingredients should go in first.
  
  5.  GF breads require extra yeast to rise.  Some recipes will double
  or triple the amount of yeast called for in a similar recipe made
  with wheat flour.
  
  6. If your machine has a yeast dispenser, do NOT use it. The bread
  will rise higher if you sprinkle the yeast on top of the dry
  ingredients just before you start the machine.
  
  7.  A combination of three or four flours will taste better than a
  mixture of just one or two flours.  The bread will rise higher as
  well.
  
  8.  Never buy your flours from an open bin.  They may be contaminated
  with small amounts of gluten containing products. Use only products
  that are sealed in a package.
  
  9.  Wheat free ingredients are not the same as gluten free products.
  
  10.  Potato starch flour is not the same as potato flour. Potato
  flour is heavier and does not work well in gluten free breads.
  
  Lactose intolerance:
  
  Cereal free soymilk makes an excellent substitute for milk. Fortified
  soymilk will also add significant amounts of protein, calcium,
  vitamin D and ribroflavin to your breads:

      Title: GLUTEN FREE STEAMED APRICOT BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Rolled oats
    2/3 c  Brown rice flour
    1/4 c  Amaranth flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Almonds
    3/4 c  Boiling water
    1/3 c  Molasses or honey
    1/2 ts Pure almond extract
    1/2 c  Dried apricots
 
  In a large bowl, combine the oats, rice flour, amaranth flour and
  baking soda. Grind the almonds to a fine powder in a blender.
  Gradually add enough water to bring the level up to 1 cup. With the
  machine running, add the molasses or honey and almond extract. Add
  the apricots and process with a few on/off turns to chop them; do not
  puree. Pour the liquid mixture into the flour bowl. Stir to mix. Turn
  out into an oiled 1 qt. mold or 1 lb can. Cover with a square of wax
  paper or foil (shiny side down); tie wax paper securely with a piece
  of string. Place the mold on a wire rack in a Dutch oven or large
  stockpot.  Add enough boiling wate to the pot to come halfway up the
  sides of the mold. Cover the pot tightly, and steam the bread over
  med-low heat for 2 hours Do not remove the cover during the cooking
  time. Remove the mold from the pot. Cool the bread in the mold for 15
  min, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. For best
  results, slice with a serrated knife. Variations: Replace the rice
  flour with 1/3 c rice polish and 1/3 c rice bran. You can also
  replace the amaranth flour with either 1/4 c soy flour, 1/4 c white
  buckwheat flour or 1/4 c ground sunflower seeds.

      Title: GLUTEN-FREE PASTRY
 Categories: Allergy, Diabetic, Pies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Whole bean flour (try puree)
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
      1 tb Cornmeal
      1 ts GF baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      6 tb Vegetable shortening
      1    Egg white
    3/4 c  Cold water
 
  Bean flour is a new product being promoted by the Ontario Coloured
  Bean Growers of Ontario.  If not available to you, try white bean
  puree. Less fat is required with bean flour than whole wheat flour
  for pastry.
  
  Stir together dry ingredients, then cut in shortening until mixture is
  crumbly using pastry blender or 2 knives. Try adding puree
  alternately with shortening.
  
  Whisk together egg white and a little less water if using bean puree.
  Stir into dry ingredients to make a soft dough. Divide dough in half.
  Roll dough out to 1/8" thickness on a cornstarch dusted surface,
  between layers of waxed paper or layers of plastic wrap. Press into
  pan, patching if necessary.
  
  For pie shell or single crust: Trim edge leaving half-inch overhang
  to tuck under and flute edge. Line inside of pastry shell with piece
  of foil. Bake at 400 F for 15 minutes or until edges are golden
  brown, remove foil.
  
  For double-crust pie: Trim edge, fill, roll top pastry. Tuck 1/2 inch
  overhang under edge of bottom crust, press firmly together. Flue
  edges. Cut steam vents. Bake as recipe directs for filling.
  
  Makes 1 double-crust, 2 single pie shells or 24 medium tart shells.

      Title: GLUTINOUS RICE
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Glutinous rice
      3 c  Coconut milk
      1 tb Salt
      1 c  Sugar
      2    Fresh mangos (optional)
 
  Soak the rice overnight in cold water. Drain the rice and then STEAM
  it for 20 minutes. While the rice is cooking, bring the other
  ingredients to a boil in a suitable saucepan. Put the steamed rice in
  a large bowl and pour the coconut milk mixture over it. Mix well. Let
  it stand for a while so the rice can absorb the liquid. You may then
  eat it as is, or, as we prefer, introduce large chunks of freshly
  peeled mango fruit. This dish has been a hit everytime we serve it!!

  2 1/4 c  Glutinous rice flour
    1/4 c  Potato flour
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Boiling water

           - (1-1/4 lb)
      1 c  Brown sugar (lightly packed)
    1/4 c  Water
 
  FOR SALTY DOUGH: To make wrapper: Bring a pot of water to a rolling
  boil for several minutes. Meanwhile, combine the first 4 ingredients.
  Now, measure the amount of water needed and return that to a boil and
  immediately pour the boiling water over the dry ingredients. Mix well
  and knead on floured board for 3 or 4 minutes. FOR SWEET DOUGH: To
  make wrapper: Mix the first 2 ingredients in a bowl. Dissolve brown
  sugar in water and bring to a rolling boil. Immediately add water to
  flour mixture and stir until dough is firm. Knead lightly for a few
  minutes until dough is well mixed. COMMENTS: This dough is usually
  deep fried with meat or sweet fillings. The texture is most
  interesting because the wrappers become soft and chewy on the inside
  and crunchy and crispy on the outside. Yield: 2 1/2 to 3 doz.

  warm.
  
  Place rice in a heat proof earthen pot.  Add water and bring to boil.
  Lower heat to medium and cook, uncovered, until all water is
  absorbed. Combine remaining ingredients and place on top of rice.
  Cover and cook at lowest heat for 20 minutes.  Let stand for

  :          Text only
  
  Glycol Punchhas two primary ingredients: Diet Mountain Dew, which has
  an decidedly evil odd yellow glow to it. Diet is necessary so that
  you don't over sugar people. BTW, we also tried other sodas,
  including Squirt, 7-up and Sprite, but none had that evil yellowness.
  
  A flourescent blue liquid. I know for a fact that the raspberry
  "little hugs" drinks for kids are the perfect color. There is a
  recent Kool-Aid blue flavor that I'm sure would work well, too.
  
  For the "little hugs" the ratio is about 4-5 barrels to 1 2-liter
  bottle of soda.  Adjust as you think best. I'd start by pouring out
  the soda and adding the blue. You know you've got it right when you
  get the sickly yellow-green of many Glycol-based Antifreezes. Plus,
  when you drink, it fizzes!

      Title: GLYNNE'S LEMON MERINGUE PIE
 Categories: Pies, Pastries
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Shortcrust Pastry-----
      8 oz Self Raising Flour
      4 oz Margarine
           Grated Rind Of 1 Orange
      1    Egg -- beaten
      2 oz Caster Sugar
           Enough Water To Form A Ball
           Dough
           Filling-----
           Juice And Grated Rind Of Two
           Lemons
      4 tb Cornflour -- (approximately)
      2    Eggs
      2 oz Caster Sugar
           Water
 
  * This is enough for two bases I normally make a pear custard tart
  with the second base)
  
  Rub the margarine into the flour until it's like bread crumbs add the
  orange rind caster sugar and mix well. Add the beaten egg and mix
  well . Add enough water ( give it a chance to soak in ) a tablespoon
  at a time to make a ball. Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for at
  least 1/2 hour.
  
  Put the juice and rind of the lemons into a measuring jug and make up
  to just less than half a pint with some water. Put the cornflour into
  a cup and mix with a couple of tablespoons of the lemon mixture until
  it is smooth . Pour the cornflour mixture and the rest of the lemon
  and water into a saucepan. Heat over a medium heat stirring
  continuously until the mixture is thick ( it does turn out very thick
  but don't worry ) and the cornflour is cooked out. Allow to cool
  stirring occasionally .
  
  Get the pastry from the fridge and roll out and line an 8 in flan
  case/ pie dish , I'm not sure what you call it , and prick the base
  with a fork. Bake the pastry blind , lined with foil & baking beans,
  for 15 mins in a hot oven ( 180-200 C) so that it doesn't rise too
  much but is golden.
  
  Remove the base from the oven.
  
  Separate the two eggs , retain the whites , and beat the yolks into
  the lemon mixture until smooth . Beat the sugar into the lemon
  mixture until smooth . Fill the pastry case with the lemon mixture .
  Add a tablespoon of sugar to the egg whites and whisk until it forms
  peaks fold in the rest of the caster sugar and pile on top of the
  pie. Bake in the oven until the meringue is nicely brown . Serve hot
  or cold.
  
  I have also tried this with oranges ( made up to 1/2 pint with orange
  juice rather than water) and lemon zest in the pastry.

  mix everything together until you have a smooth dough. cut into
  thumb-sized pieces and drop into boiling water. After they float to
  the surface, wait 1-2 minutes and then retrieve them with a slotted
  spoon. I found that using whole wheat flour kind of killed the potato
  taste of the gnocchi, so if I make these in the future I'll probably
  use white flour. Of course, this is a personal decision.  I thought
  about trying some of the more exotic flours to see if they create a
  less grainy taste; any suggestions?

      Title: GO SOAK YOUR BEANS!  SUCCESSFUL SOAKING METHO
 Categories: Info, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  Perhaps no other factor in bean cookery is more controversial than
  whether beans should be soaked, and if so, how to soak them properly
  before cooking. "What??", you say, "Soak the beans?" Perhaps you've
  been cooking them for years without soaking because many cooks do,
  but it's a fact that before those beans can really start cooking,
  they must rehydrate--the purpose of soaking.
  
  Since a bean contains only about 15% moisture in the dry form and
  rehydrates to about 60% moisture when fully cooked, you can see it
  has to soak up a lot of water. If you fail to soak the beans first,
  some of your cooking time (and energy expense) is wasted while the
  beans rehydraate. So our recommendation is, SOAK the beans
  first--especially the denser varieties such as kidneys, pinks and
  small whites.
  
  Another important factor about soaking beans is that if you use the
  preferred hot-soak method described ([below]), and let the beans soak
  for at least four hours before pouring off the soak water, you should
  find the beans cause less problems in your digestive tract. During
  the hot-soak process, many of the undigestible, soluble sugars in
  beans (a partial cause of gas problems) are dissolved into the soak
  water and go down the drain with the water. Afraid of throwing away
  some valuable nutrients? Don't be. Scientists tell us that no
  significant amounts of essential nutrients are lost. Further, the
  protein and carbohydrates, the main nutritional reason people eat
  beans in the first place, are not disturbed. And certainly, for most
  people the discomfort avoided and the improvement in flavor gained by
  discarding the soak water are much more important than the
  insignificant loss of nutritional benefits.
  
                HOT-SOAK (Preferred) METHOD and QUICK-SOAK METHOD
  
  For each pound of California dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups hot
  water. Remember, beans will rehydrate to at least twice their dry
  size, so be sure to start with a large enough pot. (Note: Up to 2
  teaspoons of salt per pound of beans may be added to help the beans
  absorb water more evenly.) Heat to boiling, let boil two to three
  minutes. Remove from heat, cover and set aside for at least one hour.
  (Quick-Soak Method), but preferably four hours or more.  The longer
  soaking time is recommended to allow a greater amount of sugars to
  dissolve, thus helping the beans to be more easily digested. Whether
  you soak the beans for an hour or several hours, discard the soak
  water.

  Dry Bean Advisory Board, 531-D North Alta Avenue, Dept. CB, Dinuba,

      Title: GOAN PORK VINDALOO IN PUNGENT BROWN SAUCE
 Categories: Indian, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Boneless pork shoulder
  1 1/2    Piece tamarind pulp (see
           -note)
     14    Dried red chile peppers,
           -seeded, coarsely chopped
  1 1/2    Sticks cinnamon
     20    Cloves teaspoons Coriander
           -seeds
      2 ts Cumin seeds
      2 ts Black mustard seeds
    3/4 ts Black pepper corns
      2 tb Minced fresh ginger
      2 tb Minced garlic
    1/2 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  Peanut oil
      2    Onions, chopped
           Salt
 
  It's interesting, as I go through this humungous pile of newspapers,
  to see how my tastes have changed over the past three years. Some of
  the things I marked then, I find myself discarding now. Some of the
  stuff that didn't interest me at the time, I'm scanning to save. This
  one was on the list then and is still on the list.
  
  Trim the meat and cut into 3/4-inch pieces.
  
  Place the tamarind in a nonmetallic bowl; pour in 1 1/2 cups hot
  water and let soak at least 1 hour.  Work the tamarind with fingers
  to squeeze out as much pulp and juice as possible. Strain into a bowl
  and set aside. Discard the residue.
  
  Heat a dry skillet over medium heat.  Add the chile peppers, cinnamon
  sticks, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mustard seeds and black
  peppercorns; roast the spices, stirring and shaking the skillet
  constantly, until the coriander, cumin and chile peppers turn several
  shades darker, and all the spices release their fragrance. This will
  take 3 to 4 minutes, Transfer to a bowl and let cool.  Grind the
  spices in a spice grinder and set aside.
  
  Put the ginger and garlic in a medium-sized non metallic bowl with the
  vinegar.  Blend in the ground, roasted spices. Add the meat and mix
  thoroughly to coat with the spice mixture. Cover the bowl and
  refrigerate overnight or up to 48 hours.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pan, add onions and cook until they turn
  reddish brown, 12 to 20 minutes.  Add the meat (with its marinade) in
  two batches, stirring and searing the pieces over medium-high heat.
  Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until almost all
  the liquid evaporates and fat separates from the mixture. You will
  see small pools of fat on the surface.
  
  Stir in the tamarind and some salt; cover and simmer until the meat
  is very tender, about 1 hour.  Check the water content from time to
  time, and add 1/4 cup hot water once or twice. Serve hot with steamed
  rice.
  
  NOTE:  Tamarind is found in cake form at Indian markets.

      Title: GOAT CHEESE & PEPPER TORTA
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Torta
 
      1 md Onion; finely chopped
      2 tb Butter
     11 oz Goat cheese
      4 tb Fresh chives, finely chopped
      4 tb Fresh cilantro, chopped
      2 ts Cumin seed
      1 ts Sweet paprika
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 ds Cayenne pepper
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      1    Green pepper; chopped
      1    Red pepper; chopped
           -- (plus top for garnish)

MMMMM------------------------FOR GARNISH-----------------------------
           Lettuce leaves
           Fresh cilantro sprigs
 
  Although this torta is from Provence, its superb taste suggests a
  Moroccan influence.  Choose a mild to mature chevre, depending on
  your taste. If goat cheese isn't to your liking, you can substitute
  feta or a mild blue cheese.  The crisp texture of the green and red
  peppers contrasts delightfully with the smooth spiced cheese.
  
  DIRECTIONS: ========== Saute the onion in butter until soft. Place all
  ingredients except peppers and garnishes in a food processor or
  mixing bowl and blend thoroughly. Line a 3- to 4-cup mold with a
  double thickness of cheesecloth.  Place the red pepper top upside
  down in the bottom of the mold and sprinkle chopped red and green
  pepper bits around it. Cover with half the cheese mixture and level
  the mixture with a spoon. Sprinkle on the remaining pepper bits and
  add the remaining layer of cheese. Fold the cheesecloth over the top
  and press it slightly to firm in place. Let the mold set overnight in
  the refrigerator.
  
  To unmold, fold back the top of the cheesecloth. Invert a serving
  plate on top of the mold and flip them over together. Lift off the
  mold and carefully remove the cheesecloth. Garnish the torta with
  lettuce leaves and fresh cilantro.

      2 ts Dry yeast
    1/4 c  Rye flour
      1 tb Milk
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Unbleached flour

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 oz Sonoma goat cheese *
      2 oz French goat cheese *
      7 oz Mozzarella; shredded
      2    Slices prosciutto **
      2 tb Finely cut fresh chives
      2 tb Minced fresh parsley
      1    Thyme sprig; chopped
      1    Marjoram sprig; chopped
      2    Sm. cloves garlic; minced
           Black pepper
 
  *Note: Sonoma goat cheese (or other goat cheese) and French goat
  cheese (such as Boucheron) should be crumbled. **Prosciutto should be
  julienned. To make dough, mix 1/4 cup lukewarm water, yeast and rye
  flour in bowl. Let rise 20 to 30 minutes. Add 1/2 cup lukewarm water,
  milk, olive oil, salt and all-purpose flour. Mix dough with wooden
  spoon, then turn out onto floured board and knead until soft and
  slightly sticky. Use quick, light motions with hands to prevent dough
  from sticking. Add more flour to board as needed but no more than is
  absolutely necessary. Knead 10 to 15 minutes until dough is soft and
  elastic. Place dough in bowl that has been brushed with olive oil.
  Oil surface of dough to prevent crust from forming. Cover bowl with
  clean towel and place in warm place, about 90 to 110 degrees, to
  rise. Let dough rise 40 minutes. Meanwhile, to make filling, combine
  goat cheeses, mozzarella, prosciutto, chives, parsley, thyme,
  marjoram and garlic in large bowl. Add pepper to taste and mix well.
  Roll out pizza dough to circle about 14 inches in diameter or divide
  dough into 2 or 3 pieces to make small calzone. For 1 large calzone,
  place entire filling on half of dough circle, leaving 1-inch margin
  around edges. Moisten edges with water and fold over other dough half
  to make edges meet. Fold up edges to form running curl, pinching to
  seal tightly. Place on floured paddle and slide onto oven floor. For

      Title: GOAT'S CHEESE SALAD WITH SWEET & SOUR ONION
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    100g somerset goat's cheese
      2    Spanish onions
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 oz Butter
           Mixed green salad
           Rocket
      3 tb Sherry vinegar
      3 tb Caster sugar
      4    Sun dried tomatoes
           Salt & pepper

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE DRESSING---------------------------
      2 tb Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Sherry vinegar
      8 tb Olive oil
      8 tb Sesame oil
           Salt & pepper
 
  Make the dressing by combining the vinegars and seasoning and then
  vigorously whisking in the combined oils to make a 'creamy' emulsion.
  Chop the tomatoes very finely, add them to the dressing, and leave to
  stand on one side.  Peel the onions and slice them into rings, no
  more than 1/4in thick preferably finer.
  
  Put the oil and butter into a frying pan and heat over a moderate
  flame. Once the butter has finished bubling, add the onion rings,
  stirring round until they are all well coated. Cook for about 15
  minutes, tossing and stirring frequently until the onions have
  softened and taken on a little colour.  Remove the pan from the heat
  and set aside.
  
  Slice the goats cheeses into halves.  Turn the grill on high. Quickly
  dress the salad leaves with a little of the dressing and divide
  between 6 plates. Then place the cheese halves on a baking tray, cut
  side up, and put under for about 5 minutes, or until the tops are
  covered with golden brown freckles and the cheese inside has started
  to melt. Put the onions back over a high flame and, stirring
  continually, tip in the sherry vinegar and sugar.  Bubble furiously
  for a couple of minutes until you can see the juices have turned
  syrupy. Remove from the heat and season lavishly with salt and pepper.
  
  To serve, put a goat's cheese half on each plate with the salad and
  then strew with the sweet and sour onions. Finally, dress with another
  tablespoon of the dressing, making sure that each plate gets a good
  sprinkling of sun-dried tomatoes.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      4 c  Whole-wheat flour
      1    To 3 cups cold water
    3/4 c  Ghee

MMMMM--------------------CAULIFLOWER FILLING-------------------------
      2 tb Ghee
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh ginger
           -root
      1 ts Finely chopped garlic
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onions

           -coarsely chopped
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh hot
           -green chili (CAUTION)
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Salt
      6    To 8 tablespoons ghee
 
  Indian Flat bread with spiced cauliflower filling
  
  DOUGH:
  
  Prepare the whole-wheat dough in the following fashion: In a small
  bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour and 1/4 cup of the ghee. With
  your fingertips rub the flour and fat together until they look like
  flakes of coarse meal. Pour 1 cup of water over the mixture all at
  once, knead together vigorously, and gather the dough into a compact
  ball. If the dough crumbles, add up to 2 cups more water, 1/4 cup at
  a time, until the particles adhere.
  
  On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough by folding it end to
  end, then pressing it down and pushing it forward several times with
  the heel of your hand. Repeat for 7 or 8 minutes, until the dough is
  smooth and elastic.  Again gather it into a ball. Place the dough in
  a bowl, drape a kitchen towel over the top, and let it rest at room
  temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling it.
  
  CAULIFLOWER FILLING:
  
  Meanwhile, in a heavy 10 to 12-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of
  ghee over high heat until a drop of water flicked into it splutters
  instantly. Stir in the ginger and garlic, then the onions. Lower the
  heat to moderate and, stirring constantly, fry the mixture for 7 or 8
  minutes, until the onions are soft and golden brown. Watch carefully
  for any sign of burning and regulate the heat accordingly.
  
  Stir in the turmeric, red pepper, cauliflower, chili, cumin and salt.
  Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and cook for 10 minutes, or
  until the cauliflower is tender but still slightly resistant to the
  bite. To make the parathas, divide the cauliflower mixture into 9
  equal portions. Divide the dough also into 9 portions and drape a
  dampened kitchen towel over them to keep the dough moist.
  
  One at a time, on a lightly floured surface, roll a ball of dough
  into a round about 5 inches in diameter. Place a portion of the
  filling mixture in the center of the round and fold the edges over
  it, pressing them together to enclose the filling securely.  Pat the
  filled paratha flat with your hands, then gently roll it again to
  make a round about 5 inches in diameter. As you shape and fill the
  parathas, set them aside, covered with a dampened kitchen towel to
  keep them from drying out.
  
  Heat an ungreased 10 to 12-inch skillet with a non stick finish or a
  well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or griddle until it is hot enough for
  a drop of water flicked into it to splutter instantly. Place one of
  the parathas in the pan and, moving it about constantly with your
  fingers or the edge of a metal spatula, cook for a minute or so. With
  a wide spatula, turn the paratha over and brush about a teaspoon of
  the ghee on the top. Cook for 2 minutes, then turn it over, spread
  with another teaspoon of ghee and cook for I minute. Turning
  frequently, continue to cook until the paratha is brown on both
  sides.  (When you have mastered the technique, you will find you can
  fry 2 or 3 parathas at a time, depending on the size of your skillet
  or griddle.)
  
  Serve the parathas warm, as a mealtime bread.  They are traditionally
  accompanied by plain yoghurt or any rayta. Parathas may be cooked
  ahead and reheated in a hot ungreased skillet for a minute or so on
  each side.
  
  Makes nine 5-inch breads.

    1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/2 ts Cayenne
      1 ea Recipe pastry dough
           Water to bind
 
  Heat 1 tb ghee in a skillet.  Saute the cumin seeds until golden. Add
  onion, cauliflower & peas & mix well. Mix in asafetida & mango powder,
  stir.  Add garam masala, salt & cayenne. Cover the pan & cook over a
  moderate heat for 10 minutes.  Remove pan from heat & cool. Divide
  mixture into 8 equal portions. Take one half-moon of pastry & brush
  the edges with water.  Fold into a cone.  Fill pastry with 1 portion
  of cauliflower mixture & seal the top. Repeat with the rest of the
  pastry. Heat sufficient ghee (or vegetable oil) in a wok or large
  skillet to deep fry 4 samosas at a time.  When very hot, deep-fry
  each samosa for a few minutes, until golden brown, flipping once to
  cook both sides. Drain on paper towels. **MARK'S NOTE:  To avoid
  excess fat I like to deep-fry the samosas, drain them very well &
  then reheat them in a toaster oven at 350F for 5 minutes or so.  If
  you place them on a grill while re-heating them, extra oil can also
  drain off.

      Title: GOBI PARATHA
 Categories: Vegetarian, Indian, Punjabi, Breads
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      3 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Finely grated cauliflower
           -OR- steamed cabbage
      2 tb Ghee
      1 bn Sliced coriander leaves
           - ("1 handful")
      3    Green chilies; minced
      1 ea 1/2" piece ginger; minced
      1 tb Mango powder
           A few sliced mint leaves
           Salt
           Chili powder
 
  Mix together salt and flour.  Rub in ghee, then add enough water to
  make a stiff dough.  Mix together the rest of the ingredients. Divide
  the dough in lemon-sized balls.  Then roll out each ball into a not
  too thin disc or a chapati on a floured board.  Spread the
  cauliflower mixture on one round chapati and cover with another round
  chapati. Seal the edges nicely, sprinkle a little dry flour on top,
  then roll out the paratha as thinly and as roundly as you can, being
  careful not to break it. Grease a smoking tava or a girdle [Uhhh...I
  think they mean a "griddle" -KM] with ghee and place the paratha over
  it.  When the undersize [sic] turns a little golden coloured, apply
  ghee on the top and turn over. Press gently and cover this side also
  with some ghee.  Keep turning and applying a little ghee until the
  paratha turns golden coloured. Serve it piping hot with a tablespoon
  of butter and a bowl of seasoned curds.

      Title: GODDESS ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Mexico, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      1 pk Tortillas, Corn (white best)
      1 lb Cheese, cheddar
      1    Onion
      1    Jalapeno
      1 cn Chili (jalapeno if you can)
      1 cn Enchilada sauce
 
  (The can of chili and enchilada sauce is for "lazy way" sauce, if you
  want the non-lazy way sauce, ask somebody else, I always make lazy
  way.)
  
  Chop or grate your onion and jalapeno pretty fine and mix with the
  cheese, which you have shredded. I usually use about a pound of
  cheese for a lasagne pan full of enchiladas, and about 16-24
  tortillas. Do NOT wipe your eyes at this point. Trust me. Wash your
  hands if your eyes are itchy.
  
  Now set up an assembly line. From left to right (or right to left if
  you're left-handed) put tortillas, your fry pan, paper towels for
  draining grease, the cheese/onion/pepper mixture and your casserole
  dish. Don't ask me why you have to do it this way, but if you don't,
  this is a really major pain.
  
  Put some grease in your fry pan. You're supposed to use lard, but I
  just can't do it (although that's why enchiladas taste better when
  you get them out, I think), I use Mazolla or something like that. Get
  the grease pretty hot but not smoking. For each enchilada do this:
  
  1. Put one tortilla in the hot grease and let it bubble a little bit,
  enough to get it really really hot, but not enough to get it crispy.
  Do both sides. Pull it out and pitch it on your paper towels.
  
  2. Quickly, before it gets hard, put a handful of the
  cheese/onion/pepper mix (which is really mostly cheese) and roll it
  up.
  
  3. Put your rolled up enchilada in your casserole dish and start with
  the next one.
  
  When you run out of tortillas, cheese, or space in the casserole
  dish, turn off the grease. You're done with that part. Now dump the
  can of chili and the can of enchilada sauce in a pan (NOT the fry
  pan) and heat it through. Dump that on top of all your enchiladas in
  your casserole pan. Spread whatever cheese you have left on top.
  Cover it with foil. If you don't want to eat real soon, put it in the
  refrigerator, these seem to taste better if they sit for a couple of
  hours, but you can bake 'em now if you want.
  
  About 30 minutes before you want to eat (about now?) put the dish in
  the oven and heat. Don't let the bottom get too hot, or you'll have
  tough enchiladas. Say, about 20 minutes at 350? Something like that.

      1 ts BAKING SODA
    1/4 ts SALT

      1 c  BUTTERMILK
      1 c  GODIVA LIQUEUR -- DIVIDED
           SHAVED CHOCOLATE
 
  For the buttercream, cream the butter until smooth. Sift the sugar and
  cocoa powder over the butter, add 1/3 cup of Godiva Liqueur and
  slowly mix until smooth. For the cake, sift together the flour,
  baking soda and salt; set aside. Cream the butter and sugar and add
  the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. On low speed,
  stir in the chocolate and gradually add the reserved sifted
  ingredients in three additions, alternating with the buttermilk and
  1/2 cup of Godiva Liqueur, beat until smooth.  Divide the batter
  among three greased and floured 9-inch cake pans. Bake in preheated
  375 degrees  oven for 25 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the
  middle of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool in
  the pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto a rack to completely cool.
  Chill the layers in the freezer for about 30 minutes, until firm. To
  assemble the cake, remove the cake layers from the freezer and brush
  with the remaining Godiva Liqueur before spreading 3/4 cup of
  buttercream between each layer. Spread the remaining buttercream over
  the top and sides of the cake, which has been placed on a serving
  plate. Serve immediately, or refrigerate if necessary. If
  refrigerating, remove 1 hour prior to serving. Garnish with shaved
  chocolate. Serves twelve. webmaster@godiva. com

  are cooked, return them to the pan.
  
  Mix the shallots, garlic, parsley and breadcrumbs together. Sprinkle

      Title: GOLDEN BISCOTTI
 Categories: Biscuits
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Sugar
      5 ts Orange zest; finely chopped*
      2    Egg
    1/4 c  Oil
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Almond extract
  1 2/3 c  Almonds, unblanched sliced
    1/3 c  Almonds, unblanched whole

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      2 tb Sugar
    1/8 ts Cinnamon, ground
      1    Egg white
 
  *Remove zest from orange in lengthwise strips with a vegetable
  peeler, and chop finely.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Food Processor Method: In a medium bowl, sift together all but 1/4 c
  of the flour with the baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and whisk
  to mix it well.
  
  In a food processor with the metal blade, process the sugar and
  orange zest until the zest is finely minced. Add the eggs and process
  for about 30 seconds or until thoroughly blended. Scrape the sides of
  the bowl.
  
  With the motor running, add the oil and extracts and process until
  blended. Add the sliced almonds and process until finely chopped. Add
  the flour mixture and process for about 7 seconds or until the flour
  is almost incorporated.  (There will be some flour clinging to the
  sides of the work bowl.  Do not overprocess as the dough will be too
  stiff to incorporate the flour completely in the processor.)
  
  Electric Mixer Method: Finely grate the orange zest. Finely chop the
  sliced almonds.  Place them both in a medium bowl. Sift together all
  but 1/4 cup of the flour with the baking powder, baking soda, and
  salt and add to the nuts and zest. Whisk together to mix them well.
  In a large mixing bowl, beat the sugar and eggs for several minutes,
  until very thick and pale in color.  With the mixer at medium speed,
  beat in the oil and extracts. At low speed, gradually beat in the
  flour mixture.
  
  For both methods: Scrape the dough (including any flour from the work
  bowl) onto a lightly flour counter and knead the dough, adding the
  remaining 1/4 c flour to form a soft, non-sticky dough.
  
  Shape the dough into two 2-inch wide cylinders.  Each will be about 7
  1/2 inches long.  Line up the whole almonds lengthwise in rows along
  the dough and press them well into the dough. With the palms of your
  hands, roll the cylinders on the counter, enclosing the almonds and
  maintaining the 2-inch diameters of the cylinders. Place the
  cylinders 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet.  In a small bowl, stir
  together the sugar and cinnamon for the topping. Beat the egg white.
  Brush the cylinders lightly with the beaten egg white and sprinkle
  them with the cinnamon topping.
  
  Bake on the upper rack of the oven for 30 minutes or until lightly
  browned and very firm.
  
  Cool the cylinders on the cookie sheet for 15 minutes or until just
  warm. Slip them off the sheet and onto a counter. With a serrated
  knife, cut diagonal 1/2 inch slices. Place the slices closely
  together on lightly buttered cookie sheets.
  
  Toast the slices for about 8 minutes.  Using a small metal spatula,
  turn them and bake for another 8 minutes or until golden brown. For
  even baking, rotate the cookie sheets from top to bottom and front to
  back halfway through the baking period.  [I NEVER do this, because I
  think you lose too much of your heat when you open the door to do it,
  so you're no longer baking at the correct temperature.  --Leti] Use a
  small, angled metal spatula or pancake turner to transfer the cookies
  to wire racks to cool completely.
  
  Store in an airtight container at room temperature. Keeps several
  months.
  
  Smart cookie hints:
  
  * Unbleached flour has more gluten-forming proteins, which help to
  hold
    the almonds in the dough and make the dough less fragile.
  
  * When the almonds are placed lengthwise, they do not fall out of the
    baked dough as readily and are more attractive when sliced.
  
  * Biscotti can be tricky to cut into neat slices.  If the cylinders
  are too hot or completely cold, the slices tend to break. When
  cutting the biscotti, hold the cylinder near the end being sliced and
  press it gently on top.  If it is still crumbly, try popping it in
  the oven almonds is another solution, but they are less dramatic in
  appearance.

      Title: GOLDEN BUTTERNUT SQUASH CHILI
 Categories: Chili
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive Oil
      2    Onions, cut in 1/4" dice
      2 tb Garlic, finely chopped
      2    Red bell peppers, 1/2" dice
      3 tb Chili Powder
      2 tb Ground Cumin
    1/4 ts Ground Allspice
  1 1/2 tb Dried Oregano
           Pinch red pepper flakes
      2 cn 28oz, Plum tomatoes, peeled,
           -chopped, with their juices
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
      2    Butternut squash, peeled,
           -cut into 1/2" dice **
      1    Finely grated zest of orange
           Salt to taste
           Ground pepper to taste
      2 cn 15 1/2 oz ea Red kidney bean
           -,drained
      2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro leaf
      2 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley
 
  ** NOTE: Butternut squash can be difficult to cut, because the pulp
  is very firm and the outer skin is slightly tough, so work carefully.
  I find that the easiest way to work with it is to cut the squash in
  half crosswise at the base of large neck.  Then carefully cut in half
  lengthwise. Scoop out any seeds in the cavity and slice the halves
  into 1/2 inch lengths crosswise.  Peel the skin from each piece and
  then cut into dice. 1. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large,
  heavy pot. Add onions, garlic and red peppers. Cook for 10 minutes,
  stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have wilted.  Add the
  chili powder, cumin, allspice, oregano and red pepper flakes; cook
  for 1 minute longer, stirring to coat vegetables well with spices. 2.
  Add the chopped tomatoes with their juices, red wine, diced butternut
  squash and orange zest. Bring all ingredients to a boil, reduce heat
  to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until squash
  is tender. Add salt and pepper to taste, and adjust seasonings. 3.
  Add the kidney beans and fold in gently. Cook 10 minutes more. Just
  before serving, stir in the chopped cilantro and parsley.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 md Onion; chopped
      2 tb Oil
      1    Pinch of saffron

    100 g  Cheddar, grated
      2    Eggs; beaten
           Salt and pepper
 
  Serves 2-3
  
  The golden colour of this dish is as appetizing as its flavours -
  saffron adding its gold to the yellowness of the courgettes. The dish
  is delectable with new potatoes and a leafy side-salad.
  
  Soften the onion in the oil over a very gentle heat, covered, for
  about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time. Add the saffron and
  season to taste with salt and pepper. Steam the courgette slices
  until tender. Mix the two together and place in a baking-dish. Add
  the cheese to the beaten eggs and season with salt and pepper. Pour
  over the vegetables and bake at 190 degrees C / 375 degrees F / gas 5
  for 20 minutes, until the topping is risen and set.

      Title: GOLDEN CRUSTED RICE
 Categories: Rice
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 c  Long-grain white rice
      6 c  Cold water
      2 tb Salt
      3 tb Margarine
      3 tb Water
      1 bn Fresh parsley
 
  ~ In fine strainer, rinse rice well under running cold water. - Place
  rice, the 6 cups water and the salt in 3- to 4-quart saucepan with
  nonstick finish. Bring to boil over medium heat; boil 15 minutes or
  just until rice is cooked but still firm. Turn rice into fine
  strainer; rinse with cold water just until steaming stops. - Wash
  saucepan well to remove starch residue. Heat margarine and the 3
  tablespoons water in saucepan over medium heat until mixture bubbles.
  Reduce heat to low; spoon rice into pan, spreading bottom layer
  evenly and pressing down gently. Surround rim of pan with folded
  paper towels, leaving very slight overhang (this insures tight fit of
  lid). - Cover, weighting down lid if needed to keep steam from
  escaping. Cook over low heat 1 hour: unmold immediately or let stand
  up to 1 hour (rice will stay hot and fluffy). To unmold, uncover pan,
  invert serving platter over pan, then turn platter and pan together.
  Gently lift off pan. - Use whole parsley to ring (give appearance of
  a bed of parsley) and chopped as garnish.

  Carciofi Dorati E Fritti To quote the author, "The reason why these
  fried artichokes are called dorati (golden) is that they are dipped
  in beaten eggs before frying...eggs from chickens raised on farms
  have yolks of a much richer color than the eggs on finds in the
  market today, and food dipped in eggs acquire a golden color...The
  best artichokes for this dish are the very best fresh and tender ones
  which have no choke at all and require only a very short cooking
  time." Prepare artichokes as directed in "How to clean artichokes -
  Jewish styles"."Cut in half lengthwise and cut each half into 3
  wedges,; keep them in this acidulated water (lemon water) for no
  longer than 15 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Dredge
  with flour and shake to remove excess. Beat the eggs yolks together.
  Heat the oil in a small frying pan. Dip artichokes in beaten egg and
  fry, a few at a time, in moderately hot oil till lightly browned on
  all sides. Sprinkle with salt, garnish with lemon wedges, and serve
  immediately.

      Title: GOLDEN HONEY BRAID
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2    To 3/4 cup warm water
      4 tb Honey
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/8 ts Ground saffron, optional
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Golden raisins, optional
           Honey
 
  Makes 1 loaf
  
  Combine 1/4 cup of the water, 1 tablespoon of the honey, yeast and
  saffron, if desired.  Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand until
  bubbly, about 5 minutes.
  
  Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, oil, remaining 3
  tablespoons of the honey and salt into work bowl. Process until mixed,
  about 15 seconds.
  
  Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
  seconds.
  
  Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough remaining water
  through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that
  cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl
  about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.
  
  Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
  make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
  dough turns around bowl about 15 times.
  
  Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Knead raisins into dough, if
  desired.  Shape into ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning
  to grease all sides. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in
  warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down dough.  Divide dough into 3 equal parts. Shape each part
  into strand 20 inches long.  Braid strands loosely together and place
  on greased cookie sheet or in greased 2 quart ring mold or tube pan.
  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until
  almost doubled, about 45 minutes.
  
  Heat oven to 350 F.  Bake until golden and loaf sounds hollow when
  tapped, 30 - 40 minutes.
  
  Remove immediately from cookie sheet or pan and place on wire rack.
  Brush honey over crust.  Cool.

  blade or a blender, process the fruit mixture in batches until
  smooth. Return the puree to the saucepan and stir in the sugar, lemon
  juice, lemon zest, cinnamon, and cloves. Bring to a boil over medium
  heat, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low and simmer,
  stirring often, until thickened and reduced to about 6 cups, about 30
  minutes. Ladle the peach butter into hot, sterilized jars, leaving
  1/4 inch of headroom. Wipe the rims clean and put the lids on the
  jars. Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Remove the jars
  from the water and cool completely at room temperature. Makes about 3
  pints. Source: "An Edible Christmas" (A Treasury of Recipes for the

  I used Cornish Game Hens, but you could also use a cut up chicken. If
  you can't get winter melon, watermelon will work. Winter melon is
  white, very mild tasting and a tad denser than watermelon. I think
  you could get away using something like Honeydew too.  Have fun!
  
  Chef: Yip Kwai-sing
  
  Thirty-year-old Hong Kong-born Mr.  Yip has spent half his life in
  Cantonese restaurant kitchens.  He is best known for his fai choy
  chicken speciality and shark's fin dishes. As the leader of a South
  Villa Restaurant team in one of the Display Classes, he won also a
  Culinary Award Bronze Medal.

  "Happy Bird Crosses The Golden Bridge" presents an attractive image
  featuring the pigeon, a symbol of happiness to the Chinese. The
  inclusion of winter melon, a summertime seasonal vegetable, as the
  imagined "golden bridge" is a culinary play on words: the dish
  combines two traditional dishes providing a bridge between their
  contrasting textures and flavours. The garnish - flowering chives -
  is more than an aesthetic detail, symbolizing the greenery growing
  along the water's edge.
  
  To prepare:
  
  1.  Mix the marinade and coat pigeons with it for 2 to
        3    minutes.
  
  2.  Remove skin of winter melon and cut 12 slices about 5 cms wide,
  
  3 cms long and 2 cms thick.  Make a slit sideways on the longest side
  of each piece and insert one ham slice.
  
  To cook:
  
  1.  Deep-fry pigeons over a medium flame until golden.
  
  2.  Heat the wok or pot, add 1 tbs oil.  When it is very hot, stir-
  fry ginger and shallots for 1 minute. Then add above stewing seasoning
  ingredients and pigeons, cover and braise over a slow flame for 20 to
       25    minutes.  Remove pigeons.
  
  3.  Reserve 1 cup of the pigeon braising stock, to make sauce later.
  
  4.  Double the remaining braising stock's liquid volume by adding
  water, then immerse winter melon slices. Cook for 5 minutes, then
  turn off heat. Cover wok, leave winter melon slices for a further 5
  minutes (thus ensuring they do not lose their shape through excess
  direct cooking).
  
  5.  Mix sauce ingredients with reserved cup of pigeon braising stock
  and heat.
  
  To present:
  
  1.  Cut pigeons into pieces and arrange across serving dish.
  
  2.  Place 6 overlapping winter melon slices on each side of pigeons.
  
  3.  Pour sauce over, and garnish with flowering chives.
  
  Makes 12 servings.

  shortening is melted. Remove from the heat and place in a large bowl
  with sugar, salt, 2 cups of flour and the yeast mixture. Add eggs;
  mix well. Cover loosely and allow to stand for 2 hours (the dough
  will be like a sponge). Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
  a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth
  and elastic, about 6 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once
  to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled,
  about 1 hour. Punch down and divide into thirds. On a floured surface
  roll each portion into a 12 inch circle. Cut each circle into 12 pie
  shape wedges. Beginning at the wide end, roll up each wedge. Place
  rolls, point side down, on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise
  30 minutes or until nearly doubled. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 15
  minutes or until golden. Yield: 3 dozen.

  NOTE:  The amount of flour can vary from 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 cups
  depending on Stir 1 3/4 cups of the whole wheat flour, sugar,
  undissolved yeast, salt and cinnamon together in a large mixing bowl.
  Heat the water and butter in a saucepan over low heat to very warm
  (120-130 degrees F.). Remove from the heat and stir in the
  buttermilk. Add to the flour-yeast mixture and beat, with an electric
  mixer on medium speed, until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs
  and beat an additional 2 minutes, then stir in the raisins. Gradually
  add the remaining 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and enough white flour
  to make a stiff but light dough. (Heaviness indicates too much flour
  and the bread will not rise correctly.) Let rest for 5 minutes. Turn
  the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth,
  about 5 to 8 minutes. Cover with the mixing bowl and let rest for 30
  minutes. Punch the dough down and divide in half.  Let rest 10
  minutes, then roll each half to a 12 X 7-inch rectangle. Beginning at
  the 7-inch side, roll up tightly like a jelly roll and seal the
  edges. Tuck the ends under to form rounded edges, (the loaf should be
  about 7 X 3-inches in size). Place on a greased baking sheet. Brush
  with oil and repeat for the second batch of dough.  Cover and let
  rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake in
  a preheated 375 degree F. oven for 25 minutes or until the loaves
  sound hollow when tapped. Remove from the baking sheet and cool on
  wire racks for 20 minutes. Frost with the vanilla icing if desired.
  VANILLA ICING: Combine the sugar, vanilla, and milk in a bowl and
  beat until smooth.

      Title: GOLDEN STUFFED PEPPERS
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Yellow peppers
    175 g  Courgettes; grated
      1 sm Onion; chopped
    225 g  Canned sweetcorn
           -- drained and pured
     50 g  Cheddar, finely grated
      1    Egg; beaten
           Pepper
 
  Yellow peppers have a gentler, sweeter flavour than red or green, and
  this mellowness is taken up by the grated courgettes and sweetcorn in
  the stuffing. The stuffed peppers are covered with grated cheese and
  baked - a delicious meal that you can serve with rice or potatoes and
  a tossed salad.
  
  Blanch the peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes, then drain, cut in
  half and deseed them. Mix the grated courgette and chopped onion into
  the sweetcorn pure and add half the cheese. Mix well and then stir
  in the beaten egg. Mix thoroughly and season to taste. Pile into the
  halved peppers. Sprinkle with the rest of the cheese and bake at 180
  degrees C / 350 degrees F / gas 4 for 25 minutes. Serve hot.

      Title: GOLDEN WARDENS
 Categories: Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Pears
      1    Lemon
           Honey
      8 fl White grape juice
 
  Warden is the old name for the small hard cooking pear that used to
  grow in many country gardens.  The best way to cook them was slowly
  with honey and fruit juice to warm and round out their thin colour
  and flavour, but this recipe works well for dessert pears too.
  
  Choose a casserole or baking dish with just enough room to lay pears
  head to tail in  single layer.  Peel the pears thinly, leaving the
  stalks on, then immediately roll each one in a saucer containing the
  juice of the lemon.  Put the pears into the dish. Spoon on scant 4
  tablespoons honey and add any lemon juice remaining in the saucer.
  Bring the grape juice to simmering point and pour it over the pears.
  Cover the dish and bake at 325-350 F (160-180 C) gas mark 3-4 until
  the fruit is beautifully tender. How long this will take varies
  enormously - 1 hour is enough for semi-ripe dessert pears; 3 hours or
  more may be needed for pears so hard that they seem to be carved from
  wood. Baste the pears frequently as they bake and turn them
  occasionally to encourage even cooking.
  
      When the pears are ready, transfer them to a serving dish,
  standing them upright.  Boil the cooking liquid until it turns syrupy
  and is reduced by about half. Stir in an extra tablespoon or two of
  honey if you think a little more sweetness is desirable but avoid the
  temptation to make the juices too sweet; the appeal of the dish lies
  in its fruitiness. Spoon the syrupy glaze over the pears.  Serve warm
  or cold.

  transparent:  add turmeric, garlic and chopped dried chilies, and
  saute for another minute (be careful not to let the garlic scorch),
  then remove onions and garlic and set aside.  Reheat oil slightly.
  Slice half the zucchini/courgette into rounds: chop the rest into
  "matchsticks". Slice and roughly chop the tomatoes:  seed and chop
  the peppers and chili. Quickly stirfry all these vegetables for about
  two minutes or until partially cooked:  add the onions and garlic
  again, then the balti sauce. Cook for about 5-10 more minutes until
  you like the consistency. If you like, add white wine or vegetable
  stock and cook a little longer until sauce reduces thick again. Serve
  in karahi with naan bread, or (if you're feeling pedestrian) on a
  plate, with rice.

      Title: GOLDENROD (THE PATRIOTIC SPECIES)
 Categories: Seasonings, Beverages, Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  "Sweet goldenrod, sometimes called blue mountain tea, has a rich
  history. Long before the arrival of Europeans, the Native Americans
  so appreciated its taste that they flavored other medicinals with it.
  After the Boston Tea Party in 1773, patriotic colonists devised a
  substitute for China tea called Liberty Tea, made from equal parts of
  sweet goldenrod, betony, red clover, and New Jersey tea (Ceanothus
  americanus). Later, sweet goldenrod became a cash crop in the United
  States; it was even exported to China, where it sold at high prices
  as a tea substitute.
  
  "To make tea from sweet goldenrod, harvest the plants just before
  they come into bloom, usually in August. If you wait too long, the
  leaves may have a slightly acrid or bitter taste. You may strip the
  leaves from the stems and place them on trays in a single layer or
  dry the stalks upside down in bundles and strip off the dried leaves.
  Provide good air circulation and avoid direct sunlight.  When the
  leaves are thoroughly crisp, store them in jars with tight-fitting
  lids, out of the sun.
  
  "Use a teaspoonful of the dried herb to a cup of boiling water and
  steep five minutes or to taste.  A half-and-half mixture of sweet
  goldenrod and peppermint makes an unusual, sweet beverage."

  over the bottom and up the sides of the pans.
  
  Combine the cream cheese with the vanilla, the remaining eggs, and

    1/2 c  Water
 
  "Why not bake a batch of cracker treats for your dog? These biscuits
  seem to satisfy the discriminating canine palate. If you are wise,
  you'll make a double recipe. 325~F. 40 to 50 minutes Preheat the oven

  In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour, oatmeal,
  cornmeal, liver powder, brewer's yeast, bone meal, and powdered milk.

  or pat it into a rectangle 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Cut into
  bone-shaped biscuits with a small knife, or use a bone-shaped cookie
  cutter. Re--roll the leftover scraps of dough and cut into shapes
  until all the dough is used.
  
  Place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet and bake

  My grandma never made these muffins, but she could have, relates John
  T. Ham, Jr., of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "They're good, old-fashioned
  grandma quality.  Serve them any time of the year, but take along
  some for a breakfast picnic.  Or wait till a picnic draws close and
  bring them out as an end-of-the-day treat."  At least four
  generations of John's clan have rated Devil's Backbone State Park
  near Strawberry Point, Iowa, their top picnic spot.

  powder,
      2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking soda, and cloves. Stir in apple and
      walnuts.
  
  2.  Combine eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter.  Add flour to the
      mixture.  Stir till just combined.  Spoon batter into greased
  muffin
      cups or pans lined with paper bake cups.
  
  3.  For Streusel topping, in a small bowl, stir together the 1/2 cup
      flour, the brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Stir in softened
      butter.  Sprinkle over batter in muffin cups.

    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/8    To 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper

           (opt'l. but I wld. include)
      1    Portion paprika

  peppers in food processor; blend to desired smoothness. Transfer to
  serving bowl.
  
  Drizzle top with olive oil; sprinkle with paprika and parsley if
  desired.
  
  Note: In her column notes, Colombo mentions that chili paste can be
  purchased at Oriental food markets.  This recipe makes no mention of
  chili paste, although it was an ingredient in the Good Neighbor
  Szechuan noodles. Seeing as how I think Good Neighbor may have "held
  back" a little bit on this recipe (they wouldn't give it out for
  years, as it's one of their best sellers), you may also want to
  experiment and add a little chili paste to this recipe, which does
  have a slight bite to it when purchased at Good Neighbors.
  
  Absolutely great with unsalted blue corn chips! Have eaten many times
  but haven't made at home yet.  It's delicious, and sells for
  $4.50/lb. at Good Neighbors.

    1/4 lb Thinly-sliced mushrooms
      1 ts Butter
      1 ea Stalk of celery, cut
      3 ea Medium carrots, cut in 3s
      6 ea New potatoes, with skins
      3 tb Tomato paste

   Add the potatoes, carrots and celery, and continue baking for another
  hour, or until the meat is tender. Slice the meat into quarter-inch
  thick slices, and arrange them, overlapping slightly, on a heating
  platter, or a heated serving dish. Set the potatoes and carrots
  around the meat; keep warm.   Puree the onions, celery and meat
  juices in an electric blender or food processor. Add the butter to a
  heavy 10-inch skillet and set over moderate heat for about  30
  seconds. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes,  until
  lightly browned. Stir in the pureed gravy. Keep warm over low heat
  until ready to serve. Spoon the sauce over the beef and sprinkle
  everything with parsley.

      3    Fresh Sage Leaves
      1    Or 2 Dried New Mexican
           -Chiles - seeded
    1/2 c  Hot Water
      1 tb Olive Oil -- or vegetable
           Oil
      1 c  Chopped Onion
           Salt
  1 3/4 ts Cumin
      3    Garlic Cloves -- finely
           Chopped
    1/2 ts Chipotle Puree
      2 ts Fresh Sage -- chopped
 
  Drain and rinse beans; place in large saucepan with cold water, bay
  leaf, and whole sage leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook
  until tender. Meanwhile, cover chiles with hot water, soak about 20
  minutes, and puree in a blender. Heat oil in large skillet; add
  onion, 1 tea salt, and 1 tea cumin. Saute until tender; add garlic
  and saute 1-2 minutes more. Add beans and broth to the onion along
  with 1/2 tea salt, the remaining cumin, and the chili puree. Cook
  medium about 25 minutes, stirring as needed. The beans should be soft
  but not mushy. Add chopped sage and salt to taste. Note: I made this
  at a school using canned beans, eliminating the soaking and long
  cooking. I also used your basic chile powder instead of the dried
  chiles, also eliminating the soaking. The chipotles are crucial,
  though - salsa works as well as the puree, though you need to use a
  little more

      Title: GOOEY CHEESE BREAD ABM
 Categories: Breads, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Water
      2    Eggs
    1/4    Unsalted Butter
      1 ts Honey
      1 ts Salt
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      2 ts Yeast

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      3 c  Swiss Cheese; shredded
 
  Place all dough ingredients in pan and program for knead only. Press
  start. The dough will be slightly sticky. After the kneading cycle,
  transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic
  wrap, and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight, or as long as 24
  hours. Grease and flour a 9" cake pan. Preheat the oven to 375F.
  with the rack in the center position.
  
  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly
  floured work surface. Roll the dough to a 14 x 10 rectangle with the
  long side nearest you. Sprinkle 2 cups of the cheese over the surface
  of the dough. Starting with the edge closest to you, roll the dough
  up like a jelly roll. Press the edges together and turn it over so
  the seam is now facing down. With the seam still down, roll the
  cylinder around itself in a coil and transfer it to the prepared pan.
  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top of the loaf and allow to
  rise, uncovered for 20 minutes. Bake for 35 minutes at 375F., then
  turn the oven down to 350F. and bake for 10 more minutes. If the
  cheese begins to brown quickly during the first 35 minutes, turn the
  oven down sooner.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg

MMMMM---------------------------ROLLS--------------------------------
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 c  Skim milk
    1/4 c  Margarine
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg
      3    Egg whites
  2 1/4 c  Whole-wheat flour,
           -approximately

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Firmly packed dark brown
           -sugar
    1/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
      1 tb Ground cinnamon
    1/4 c  Margarine
    3/4 c  Raisins
           Nonstick cooking spray
 
  To make rolls: Combine all-purpose flour and yeast in a large mixing
  bowl; set aside. In a small saucepan over low heat, combine milk,
  margarine, sugar and salt. Stir just until the margarine starts to
  melt (120 to 130 degrees). Add to the flour and yeast mixture, mixing
  well.
  
  Add egg and egg whites to the flour mixture and beat with an electric
  mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping the sides of the bowl
  constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using a spoon, stir in
  as much of the whole-wheat flour as you can.
  
  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead in enough of
  the remaining flour to make a soft dough that is smooth and elastic,
  kneading for about 4 minutes. Shape into a ball and place in a bowl
  which has been sprayed with a nonstick cooking spray. Turn ball over
  once and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1
  hour.
  
  To make filling: While dough is rising, make the filling. Combine
  brown sugar, flour and cinnamon in a medium bowl and mix well. Cut in
  the margarine until crumbly, using two knives or a pastry blender;
  set aside.
  
  To form: Punch dough down and turn onto a lightly floured surface.
  Cover and allow to rest 10 minutes. Roll dough out into a 12-inch
  square and spread filling evenly over the dough. Top with raisins and
  roll up tightly like a jelly roll, pinching to seal the seam. Cut
  roll into eight 1 1/2-inch slices and arrange slices, cut side up, in
  a 9-by-13-inch baking dish sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Cover
  the dish loosely with clear plastic wrap and allow to rise again
  until almost double in size, about 45 minutes.
  
  To bake: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Before baking, remove the
  plastic wrap and lightly spray the tops of the rolls with a nonstick
  cooking spray. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly brown. If
  the rolls start to get too brown, cover them with foil the last 5 to
  10 minutes of baking.
  
  Remove rolls from oven and allow to cool 2 minutes. Invert onto a
  wire rack and allow to cool slightly. Invert them again onto a
  serving dish. Serve warm or allow to cool to room temperature and
  freeze for future use.
  
  Makes 8 rolls.

      Title: GOONG KOB POH (HOT & COLD SHRIMP)
 Categories: Thailand, Seafood, Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 kg Medium size fresh shrimp
      7    Red hot chili
      3    Cloves garlic
      1 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Hot water
      2 tb Lime juice
      1 tb Hot sauce *
      1 tb Chopped coriander
           * (Sriracha or Sambel
           -Lampung) [Sriracha is a
 
  Thai hot sauce, available here, and comes in several varieties++ from
  mildly warm to blisteringly hot. Some of them are quite similar to a
  thick Tabasco sauce which is what I would use for a substitute. S.C.]
  
  Here is a recipe from my new Thai cookbook that is mainly a dip,
  since the shrimp are either grilled or eaten raw with the rest of the
  ingredients. I haven't made this yet, but the dip sounds quite
  similar to the Vietnamese "Nuoc Cham" (which would be good also.)
  
  Peel shrimp, remove the center black line, leave the tail on. Clean
  and drain, arrange on a plate, chill for 2 hours. Pound the chili and
  garlic until fine. Place into a small bowl. Mix sugar, salt and hot
  water and stir until sugar is dissolved.  Pour over pounded chili and
  garlic. Add lime juice and hot sauce, stir and top with chopped
  coriander.
  
  To Serve:  Thread the shrimp onto the sticks.  Cook over charcoal
  until done to satisfaction.  Dip in prepared sauce to taste. It can
  be served raw and cold.

 Categories: Thailand, Seafood, Pastas, Thai
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Bean Thread Noodles
      2 tb Vegetable Oil
    1/4 c  Cilantro Pesto (See Recipe)
      1 tb Fresh Ginger, Finely Chopped
      1 lb Shrimp, Peeled & Deveined
    1/3 c  Coarsely Chopped Green Onion
    1/4 c  Chicken Stock
      2 tb Fish Sauce (Nam Pla)
      1 tb Oyster Sauce
      1 tb Chinese Rice Wine Or:
           Dry Sherry
      1 ts Dark Soy Sauce
      1 ts Asian Sesame Oil
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
           Handful Of Cilantro Leaves

MMMMM-----------------------CILANTRO PESTO----------------------------
      1 ts Whole White Or Black
           Peppercorns
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Fresh
           Cilantro Roots Or Leaves
           And Stems
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Garlic
 
  CILANTRO PESTO:  Using a mortor and pestle or a spice grinder, crush
  or grind the peppercorns to a fine powder. Combine the pepper,
  cilantro roots and garlic; work the three inngredients innto a fairly
  smooth paste in the mortor or in a small blender or food processor.
  If you use a blender or food processor, you may need to add a little
  vegetable oil or water to ease the grinding.  Make about 1/4 cup. For
  an industrial strength batch use 1 tb peppercorns, 1/2 cup cilantro
  roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the pesto for later use, put in a
  glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface to cover it and seal
  tightly. It will keep nicely for about 1 week in the refrigerator.
  
  CLAY POT SHRIMP:  Place the noodles in a large bowl and add warm
  water to cover.  Soak the noodles until they become limp and white,
  about 15 minutes.  Drain and set aside. You should have about 5 cups
  softened noodles.  In a large clay pot or flameproof, heavy-bottomed
  casserole, heat the oil over medium heat until hot, about 1 minute.
  Add the pesto and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute, adding a
  little more oil if it sticks or burns.  Add the ginger and shrimp and
  stir-fry for 1 minute. Toss in the green onion, turning the mixture
  once more. Transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside while you
  prepare the noodles and sauce. In a small bowl, combine the chicken
  stock, fish sauce (Nam Pla), oyster sauce, rice wine, soy sauce,
  sesame oil, sugar and salt; stir to mix well. Place the soaked
  noodles in the clay pot in which you cooked the shrimp mixture.
  Scrape the shrimp mixture over the noodles and pour in the chicken
  stock mixture.  Toss the noodles and shrimp a little to combine them
  with the sauce, then cover the pot tightly. Place the clay pot over
  medium heat and cook until the noodles are soft and clear and the
  shrimp is done, about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with the cilantro leaves
  and serve at once. From: Real Thai, The Best Of Thailand's Regional

  simmer, uncovered, until beer is reduced by one third, about 45
  minutes. Add thyme, bay leaves, tomato paste and stock. Cover pot and
  simmer until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
  
  5. Remove ribs to a serving platter or bowl; keep warm. Remove and
  discard thyme and bay leaf. Pass broth and onions through food mill
  into a sauce pan. (Alternatively, puree the onions with a little
  broth in food processor.) Skim fat from sauce. Reheat, boiling

      Title: GOOSEBERRY BURNT CREAMS
 Categories: Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Tart green gooseberries
      4 oz Caster sugar (or more)
      5 oz Granulated sugar
    1/2 lb Fromage blanc or quark*
    1/2 pt Double cream
 
  *Note: Creamy Greek yoghurt may also be used instead of fromage blanc
  or quark. Choose a heavy-based saucepan with a large surface area.
  Put the topped and tailed gooseberries into it, still moistened by
  the water in which they have been rinsed. Cover and cook over very
  low heat until the fruit is perfectly tender. (It does not matter if
  the berries collapse in cooking here as they will be crushed to a
  pulp for serving.) Crush the cooked fruit with a potato masher and
  cook for several minutes more, without the lid but just stirring
  occasionally, until most of the juices have evaporated leaving a
  thick fruit puree.  Add caster sugar to taste and stir until melted.
  Spoon the puree into 8 individual cocotte dishes and leave until
  cold. Beat the fromage blanc, quark or yoghurt into the cream until
  smoothly mixed then whisk until fairly stiff. Spoon the creamy
  mixture over the cold puree and level the tops. Cover and chill in
  the freezer for about 45 minutes until the cream firms up. Dissolve
  the granulated sugar in 1 tablespoon warm water in a pan placed over
  low heat. Then turn the heat up and cook until the sugar carmelises
  to a rich shade of gold.  Quickly pour the burnt sugar evenly over
  the chilled creams and set aside for 20 minutes or so until the
  caramel sets in thin brittle sheets of gold.

      Title: GOOSEBERRY CURD
 Categories: Fruits, Preserves
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pt Gooseberries
      2 tb -Water
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      2    Eggs
      1    Egg yolk
 
  Rinse the gooseberries and put them in a non-corroding saucepan with
  the water.  Cover and cook over low to medium heat, stirring
  occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until the gooseberries are
  very mushy. Puree them through a food mill or a strainer.  You should
  have about 1 1/4 cups of puree. Stir the sugar and butter into the
  warm puree and heat, stirring constantly.  Whisk the eggs and the egg
  yolk just until mixed, then whisk in a little of the hot gooseberry
  mixture to heat the eggs. Return to the pan and cook over low heat,
  stirring constantly, until the mixture is well thickened, and has
  reached a temperature of 170 F. Pour into a container, cover, and
  chill. Use this to fill small tartlets, garnishing them with rosettes
  of creme de Chantilly; or fill a 9-inch pre-baked tart shell with the
  curd and pipe rosettes of creme Chantilly over the top, leaving a
  small spot uncovered in the center so the curd will show. This also
  makes a delicious filling for cakes. Like most high-acid fruit curds,
  this will keep at least two weeks in the refrigerator. Creme
  Chantilly: Whip the amount of cold fresh cream needed for your recipe
  until it mounds softly and will just barely hold its shape. The
  volume will approximately double after it is whipped.  There should
  be no hint of graininess, which is the first sign that the cream is
  overbeaten and turning to butter. Stir in vanilla and sugar to taste.
  Or you may flavor the cream with spirits or liqueurs, wine, fruit
  purees or jams, or the reduced liquid from poached fruit.

  *Pineapple Ice* may be made of canned pineapple using pint of juice,
  and gill lemon juice with above proportion of syrup, adding the
  pine-apple cut in dice just before serving, if wished. With all ices
  if is always add a gill of lemon juice, as the acid assists in the
  freezing and also adds to the flavor.
   Any proportions of the recipe may be made; above makes about two
  dozen dishes.

  miso soup.
  
  I think when I make this for company I'll use both red and yellow
  peppers to roast. Last night I tried some Mazetti's (sp?) roasted red
  peppers, which are packed without oil. Also, you would never have
  gotten me to mix raisins with anything savory a few months ago, but
  this really is good!

 Categories: Afghan, Desserts, Ethnic
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
      2    Eggs
      2 ts Caster sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Milk
      4 ts Oil
  2 1/2 c  Plain flour
    1/4 c  Plain flour for kneading
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
           Oil for deep-frying

MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
      1 c  Icing (confectioners') sugar
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom (optional)
    1/2 c  Finely chopped pistachios
 
  *Note: Pistachio nuts should be blanched.  Optionally, same amount of
  finely chopped walnuts may be used intead of pistachios.
  
  Beat eggs until frothy, beat in sugar and salt. Stir in milk and oil.
  Sift flour, add half to egg mixture and blend in with wooden spoon.
  Gradually stir in remainder of flour, holding back about 1/2 cup.
  Turn onto floured board and dust with some of reserved flour. Knead
  for 10 minutes until smooth and glossy, using more flour as required.
  Dough will still be slightly sticky.   Cover with plastic wrap and
  rest for 2 hours.
  
  Take a piece of dough about the size of a large hazelnut and roll out
  on a floured board to a circle about 8-10 cm (3-4 inches) in
  diameter. Gather up dough on one side and pinch, forming a shape
  resembling an elephant ear. Place on a cloth and cover. Repeat with
  remaining dough.
  
  Deep fry one at a time in oil, heated to 190 C (375 F) turning to cook
  evenly.  Fry until golden, do not over-brown. As dough is rather
  elastic, the pastry tends to contract with handling, so just before
  dropping pastry into hot oil, pull out lightly with fingers to
  enlarge.
  
  Drain pastries on paper towels.  Sift icing sugar with cardamom if
  used and dust pastries with mixture. Sprinkle with nuts and serve
  warm or cold. Store in a sealed container.
  
  Alternative topping:  Make a syrup with 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water.
  Bring to the boil when sugar is dissolved and boil for 5 minutes.
  Dribble syrup onto warm pastries and sprinkle with cardamom and nuts.

      Title: GOUGERES (CHEESE PUFFS)
 Categories: Appetizers, Breads, Misc, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 c  Sifted flour
      4    Eggs
      4 oz Grated Gruyere cheese
      2 tb Dijon mustard
 
  The easiest and most consistent way to form the gougeres is to pipe
  out small rounds using a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip.
  Lacking this, you could also use 2 teaspoons.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Place the water, butter, salt and pepper in a
  small saucepan and bring to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat
  (do not allow it to boil for any length of time) and add the flour
  all at once. Stir with a wooden spoon until a ball forms. Return to
  medium heat to dry the paste. Flatten the paste on the bottom of the
  pan, bring it up to the side of the pan nearest you, then flop it
  over to the opposite side of the pan. Continue until butter starts
  oozing out in bubbles, about 5 minutes. When pinched, the paste
  should not stick to your fingers. Remove from the heat and wait 5
  minutes until slightly cooled, then beat in the eggs one at a time,
  waiting until each is incorporated before adding the next. Add the
  cheese and mustard. Butter a baking sheet, then rinse under cold
  water, or place parchment paper on the baking sheet. Pipe out small
  dots, about 1/2-inch in diameter, leaving enough room for them to
  triple in size. Brush with beaten egg or milk, sprinkle with more
  cheese, and bake for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 400F, open the
  oven door briefly to let the steam escape and then bake for an
  additional 10 minutes. Cool on a rack. Gougeres freeze well.

      5 lg Eggs at ROOM TEM.!!MUST!!!
 
  preheat 425 degrees. Add butter, salt, pepper and nutmeg to 1 cup
  water in medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
  When butter melts, reduce heat to low. Add flour to butter-water
  mixture all at once and cook over low heat, beating with a wooden
  spoon, for 1 minute, until mixture pulls away from sides of pan.
  Remove pan from heat. Add cheese to pan and beat in with a wooden
  spoon until well incorporated. Add 4 of the eggs, 1 at a time,
  beating each egg into the batter unil thoroughly absorbed. Continue
  beating mixture until it is smooth, shiny, and firm. Drop batter in
  small spoonfuls onto a lightly greased cookie sheet to form Gougeres.
  Beat remaining egg with 1/2 tbsp water, then brush tops of uncooked
  Gougeres with egg wash. Bake in upper third of oven for 15-20 minutes
  or until Gougeres are golden and doubled in size. Remove from oven

  I just didn't have room in the fridge  ;->  And the cookies are still
  huge when I use the 1/4 Cup to spoon 'em out...
  
  *  Will use approximately 16 oz. of nuts and 18 oz. of chips.

 Categories: Cookies, Kooknet
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
      1 c  Packed dark brown sugar
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Softened butter
    1/2 c  Shortening
      2    Eggs
      1    And 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
      1    And 1/2 cups flour
      1 ts Baking soda
     12 oz Chocolate chips
      1 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
 
  Tasks and Milestones: After procurement actions for the above required
  commodities, and subsequently identified appliances and
  instrumentalities, decontainerize materials. Perform succeeding
  measurement tasks sequentially.
  
  In a mixing bowl the incumbent will execute materials allocation for
  the brown sugar, the granulated sugar, the butter, and the shortening
  in an approved mixing container; order is precedential and
  unwaiverable. Incumbent will next impact the interfacement of eggs
  and vanilla, avoiding an overallocation scenario.
  
  To avoid at all cost being on the critical path, incumbent shall next
  perform materials loading of lour and soda into a bowl and aggregate.
  Equalize with prior mixture and develop intense and continous liaison
  among materials until minimum slack prevails. Assimilate key
  chocolate and nut subprojects and execut stirring operations.
  
  In a parallel task, an equally skilled and proficient incumbent will
  take actio to prepare the heating environment for throughput by
  manually setting the oven baking unit to a temperature of 350 degrees
  fahrenheit. When performed in a reasonable proficient manner, this
  will prevent a precedence relationship between the predecessor and
  successor creating a lag.
  
  Incumbent shall next allocate the aggregated materials in a dangling
  fashion from a teaspoon implement onto an ungreased cookie sheet at
  intervals sufficient to permit planned and actual separation of
  throughputs, thereby creating the maximum positive slack practicable
  under prevailing conditions.
  
  Position aforesaid cooking sheet into above conditioned oven
  instrument, in a bake or equivalent manufacturer recommended
  situation, and monitor for an earliest finish of eight minutes and an
  absolute finish of ten minutes baking aspect.  Incumbent is to
  initiate sequentially the coordination of baked materials within the
  cooling rack function, and subsequently to containerize when ambient
  condition is attained.
  
  Projected value:  3 dozen cookie units.

  minutes. Drain and squeeze out excess water.
  
  3. Cut wonton wrappers into circles using 3-inch (8 cm) biscuit or
  cookie cutter. Cover wrappers with plastic wrap to avoid excessive
  drying.
  
  4. Remove shells and back veins from shrimp. Finely chop shrimp, pork,
  onions and mushrooms with cleaver, sharp knife or food processor.
  Transfer chopped foods to large bowl. Add soy sauce, ginger and
  garlic. Mix well.
  
  5. Place level teaspoon (5 mL) pork mixture onto center of each wonton
  circle. Brush edges with water. Fold circles in half over filling,
  pressing edges firmly together to seal.
  
  6. Heat vegetable oil in wok over high heat until it reaches 375
  degrees F (190 C). Fry 8 to 10 gow gees at a time in hot oil until
  golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on absorbent paper. Serve with Sweet

           Apples
           Flour
      1 c  Milk; sour
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/3 ts Baking soda
 
  Lay in a deep dish, nice quartered apples, and pour over them a thin
  batter made of flour, one teacup of sour milk, one-half cup of sugar
  and about one third of a teaspoon of soda. Bake in a moderate oven
  till the apples are thoroughly cooked.
  
  Baked in the manner of a fruit cobbler, we assume this apple dish was
  made with graham, or whole wheat flour, although white flour was
  plentiful by 1861 and was preferred for dessert recipes. The quaint
  name may have referred to its appearance and could have prompted
  California Farmer to publish it.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  White flour
      1 pk Yeast
      2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ginger
      1 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Water
    1/4 c  Molasses
      3 tb Butter
      1 ts Salt
      3 c  Graham flour
 
  In large bowl stir together white flour, yeast, cinnamon and ginger.
  In saucepan combine milk, water, molasses, butter and salt. Heat to
  115 to 120 degrees, and butter is almost melted.  Add to flour
  mixture, beat on low speed of electric mixer 1/2 minute, scraping
  sides of bowl constantly. eat three minutes on high, stir in graham
  flour. Stir in as much remaining flour as you can stir in with a
  spoon. Turn out onto floured surface. Knead in enough white flour to
  make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic, (8 to 10
  minutes). You can use a bread machine for this, or personally I now
  use a Kitchenaid mixer with dough hook (since my two bread machines
  died). Shape into a ball, place in greased bowl, turn over once to
  coat.  Cover, let rise until double, about 1 hour. Punch down, divide
  dough in half.  cover let rest 10 minutes. Shape into two loaves,
  whatever shape you want, and place in bread pans, pie pans for round
  loaves, or free form on a cookie sheet. Cover, let rise until double,
  about 30 minutes. Bake 375 25 - 30 minutes. Cool before slicing. This

      Title: GRAHAM CRACKER CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     25    Double graham crackers,
           -broken (3 1/3 cups)
    1/2 c  Shredded desiccated coconut
           -(unsweetened, if desired)
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  (1 stick) unsalted butter
      1 c  Superfine or strained sugar
      4 lg Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Milk
      4 lg Egg whites
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
 
  Mocha Whipped Cream Filling (recipe next post)
  
  Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350
  degrees. Butter two 9-inch layer pans and line the bottoms with
  parchment paper circles. Rebutter parchment paper.
  
  Put broken graham crackers and coconut into the container of a food
  processor fitted with steel blade. Process until the cracker crumbs
  and coconut are ground very fine. Add the baking powder and pulse 6
  to 8 times to blend.  Set aside.
  
  Cut the butter into 1-inch pieces and put them in the large bowl of an
  electric mixer fitted with beaters or paddle attachment. Soften on low
  speed.  Increase speed to medium-high and cream the butter until
  smooth and light in color, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.
  
  Add the sugar, 1 Tbsp at a time, take 6 to 8 minutes to blend it in
  well. Scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally.
  
  Add the the yolks, 2 at a time at 1-minute intervals, scraping the
  sides of the bowl as necessary.  Beat 1 minute longer. Blend in the
  vanilla.
  
  Reduce mixer Speed to low.  Add the crumb mixture alternately with the
  milk, dividing the crumbs into three parts and the liquid into two
  parts, starting and ending with the crumbs. Scrape the sides of the
  bowl and mix for 10 seconds longer.  Transfer to a large bowl and set
  aside.
  
  Put the egg whites in a separate bowl and beat them on medium speed
  with clean dry beaters or whip attachment until frothy. Add the cream
  of tartar and increase the speed to medium high. Beat until the
  whites form firm moist peaks.  With a 2 3/4 inch wide rubber spatula,
  fold in one quarter of the whites to lighten the batter, taking about
  20 turns. Fold in the remaining whites, taking about 20 additional
  turns.
  
  Spoon the batter into the prepared pans, smoothing the surface with
  the back of a tablespoon.  Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 30
  minutes, or until cake begins to come away from the sides of the pan
  and is springy to the touch.
  
  Remove cake from oven.  Set the pans onto cake racks for 10 minutes
  to cool slightly, then invert onto racks sprayed with nonstick
  coating. Lift off the pans and carefully peel off the parchment. When
  the cake is completely cool, fill and frost.

    1/4 c  Uncooked bulgur wheat
      3 c  Low-sodium beef stock
    3/4 lb Lean ground beef
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 tb Low-sodium tomato paste
      1 ts Olive oil
      1 ds Sesame oil
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      1 c  Carrots; chopped
    1/4 c  Celery; chopped
      2    Cloves garlic; peel/chop
      1 tb Fresh thyme; chopped
      1 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
    1/2 ts Marjoram
      1 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
      1 tb Prepared horseradish
      1 tb Arrowroot; mixed with
      2 tb Beef stock
 
  POTATOES:
  
  Boil in a large pot of water for 20 minutes with the salt. Drain;
  return to the pot, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let steam
  dry for 15 minutes over very low heat. Add the pepper and buttermilk,
  and mash until smooth. Set aside until needed.
  
  FILLING:
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the bulgur in a medium bowl.
  Heat 2 cups of the stock in a small caucepan, pour over the bulgur,
  and set aside for 10 minutes to soften.
  
  Brown the beef with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a frying pan over
  high heat until brown. Push the meat to one side, reduce the heat to
  medium, add the tomato paste to the hot pan, and stir until it starts
  turning dark. Pour the remaining cup of beef stock into the pan,
  stirring to free all the flavorful bits, then transfer the filling to
  a bowl, and set aside.
  
  Without washing the pan, heat the oil over medium heat and start
  frying the onions. When they begin to wilt, add the rest of the
  vegetables, garlic, herbs, and the remaining salt, and cook for 2
  minutes. Add the soy sauce, horseradish, bulgur, and beef stock and
  simmer for 10 minutes or until the carrots are tender. Add the cooked
  meat mixture, and stir in the arrowroot slurry. Bring to a boil, and
  pour into a 9x9 baking dish. Spread the mashed potatoes over the top
  of the hot filling or pipe them on, using a large star tip. Bake in
  the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then place under the broiler for 2
  minutes to brown the potatoes slightly.

      4    Fresh sage leaves
      4    Fresh thyme sprigs
      1 tb Fresh chopped parsley
      2    Garlic cloves
           -peeled and chopped
    1/4 ts Freshly ground white pepper
    1/8 ts Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 325-degrees F.  Split the turkey breast, remove its
  skin, and set skin aside.  Place sage, thyme, parsley, garlic,
  pepper, and salt on one half of turkey breast, and place other half
  on top. Put in a medium-size loaf pan, tucking reserved skin around
  the breast to seal in juices.  Bake for approximately 2-1/3 hours
  (the rule of thumb is 35 minutes per pound).  Poke the turkey with a
  fork. When the juices run clear, turkey is done.

      Title: GRAINS
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  ================== Information file ================== WHOLE WHEAT Is
  ideal for cereals, soups, salads, main dishes. The usual proportions
  to cook are 1 part wheat to 2 parts water plus 1/2 - 1 tsp salt.
  Wheat can be steamed, cooked in a crock pot, pressure cooker or
  successfully prepared by the oven method:
  
  OVEN: Preheat oven to 300F. combine wheat and water in a pan and
  bring to a boil. Boil 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and place in
  oven. Turn oven off.  Leave wheat undisturbed overnight or for 8- 10
  hours.
  
  THERMOS METHOD: is easy, saves fuel and attention and gives a chewy
  product: Preheat 1 quart thermos with boiling water. Boil 1 cup wheat
  and 2 cups water for 3 minutes. Place in thermos, seal and let stand
  overnight. Wheat cracked in grinder or blender can be used for
  cereal, casseroles, bread,cookies. Proportions are 1 part cracked
  wheat to 4 parts water for coarse textured bread. Cook enough
  wholewheat to last at least a week. The ready to use wheat may be
  stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. 1 cup wheat
  makes 4-6 servings. Reheat cooked wholewheat. Serve wit mushroom
  sauce or gravy in place of potatoes. Use in place of rice for
  stroganoff, etc. Add cooked whole or cracked wheat to casseroles,
  chili, spaghetti sauce, sloppy joes, soups, stews, salads,sandwich
  spreads, etc.
  
  SPLIT PEAS: Should be combined with other protein food for good
  nutrition. Good in soups or as a vegetable. For a quick soup, grind
  peas, whole or split,to a flour. (combine with water in a blender for
  1 minute) (1 part pea flour to 3-4 parts liquid).  Simmer 3 minutes
  and season. Raw vegetables may be added in the blender or to the
  soup. Ham flavoring is good.  Bean soup may also be made this way.
  
  SOYBEANS: Should be an important part of the storage program. They
  are very high in both amount and quality of protein. Soybeans are
  rich in minerals, B vitamins, and unsaturated fats. They can be grown
  in the home garden and used green or dried.  Store dry soybeans in a
  cool dry place and rotate every 3-5 years. To cook, soak soybeans
  overnight (3-4 cups water to 1 cupp beans)  in the refrigerator.  If
  the beans are hard,boil 2 minutes before soaking.  To sak quickly,
  boil 2- 5 minutes, remove from heat, cover and let stand 1 to 2
  hours. If the soaking water isn't bitter, use it to simmer the beans
  in for 3 or more hours, until tender. Soybeans can be used for baked
  beans or substituted for lima or navy beans. Use part soybeans in
  your chili recipe, bean salads, etc.

   Nothing, absolutely nothing, was as delectable as these cookies that
  my grandmother taunted us with.
  
   Preheat oven to 350.
  
   In a large bowl, combine brown sugar and butter; mix well. Beat egg
  and add to creamed mixture; mix well. Add cocoa and mix.
  
   In a separate bowl, measure flour and baking soda. Add dry
  ingredients alternately with milk to egg and cocoa mixture. Stir in
  vanilla and chopped nuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto a cookie sheet
  and bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes. Remove to wire racks and let cool.
  
   While cookies are baking, make icing by combining all ingredients.
  Thin with a little milk if icing is too thick.
  
   When cookies have cooled, frost with chocolate icing.

 Categories: Breads, Holiday
      Yield: 1 Dozen
 
    1/2 c  Oatmeal (rolled oats)
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Shortening
      2 tb Molasses
      2 tb Honey
      1 c  Water, boiling
    1/2 c  Water, warm
    1/2 oz Yeast (dry), active
           -(2 packages; do not
           -use quick-rising yeast)
      1 ts Honey
      1    Egg
  2 1/2 c  Flour, unbleached
           -(up to 3 1/2 C)
 
  Combine oatmeal, whole-wheat flour, salt, shortening, molasses and
  honey. Pour boiling water over all.  Mix and let cool.
  
  While cooling, dissolve yeast in warm water with the honey. Add egg to
  cooled batter, then mix in dissolved yeast.
  
  Add flour until dough is just soft enough to knead. Knead lightly.
  Place dough in a greased bowl; cover with a damp cloth. Let rise in
  warm place until doubled in bulk; about one hour.
  
  Punch down dough and cut into 12 equal pieces.  Shape each piece into
  a ball in put into a greased 9-inch pan. Let rise again for 45
  minutes.
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 40 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Holiday rolls with oatmeal and molasses -- This recipe has long
  been part of my Thanksgiving tradition. I have long since forgotten
  its source.
  
  *  These rolls are really wonderful, but they need time to rise.
  start them as early in the day as possible. Don't even think about
  using the quick-rise yeasts.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  several hours preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  sugar; mix until very fluffy. Add egg yolks, liqueur and vanilla;
  beat until creamy. Transfer to larger bowl. Fold melted chocolate
  into creamed mixture. Use a food processor or blender to chop pecans
  to a coarse powder. Combine nuts with crumbs and fold into chocolate
  mixture. Beat egg whites with salt, gradually adding remaining 1/4
  cup sugar; beat until soft peaks form. Stir 1/4 of egg whites into
  chocolate mixture; fold in remaining egg whites. Pour batter into a
  buttered 9" springform pan lined with waxed paper. Bake at 350-F on
  bottom rack for 45-50 minutes or until center is firm. Cool on rack.
  Cake will sink slightly in the center. Remove pan and liner. Top with
  Chocolate Ganache Glaze and Grand Marnier Whipped Cream Decoration.
  
  Chocolate Ganache Glaze: Finely chop chocolate. Heat cream until hot.
  On very low heat add chocolate, stirring until smooth and thick.
  Remove from heat. Stir in liqueur. Turn torte, top side down, onto
  serving plate. Arrange strips of waxed paper under cake edge to catch
  excess glaze. Pour glaze over top and sides of cake. After a short
  time, run excess glaze up sides of cake. Cover sides of cake with
  nuts. Remove waxed paper strips. Chill cake while preparing topping.
  
  Grand Marnier Whipped Cream Decoration: Whip cream with sugar and
  liqueur until it holds a shape. Do not overbeat. Pipe rosettes or
  form a ring of whipped cream around top of chocolate glazed torte.
  With a sharp knife cut peel from orange. Slice into circles; cut into
  quarters. Place oranges around cake on top of whipped cream. If
  preferred, sprinkle grated orange rind over whipped cream. Cake
  should be stored in a cool place until served.

      Title: GRAND MARNIER TYPE LIQUEUR
 Categories: Liqueurs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  80 proof vodka
      4    Oranges, juice and zest
      3 c  White sugar
      1 tb Corriander seed
      3 oz Imitation brandy flavor
           Brown food dye
 
  Cut or scrape the orange colored part off the orange peel. This is
  the zest and is quite rich in aromatic essences. Be careful not to
  get any of the white pith of the peel since it is very bitter.
  Squeeze the oranges and strain the juice well. In a mixing jar place
  the orange juice, zest, vodka and the corriander seed. Cover and
  leave to infuse for two weeks. Drain thru a coarse sieve and return
  to the mixing jar. Discard the residue. Add the brandy flavor and the
  sugar. Shake vigorously until the sugar is dissolved. Leave to clear.
  This liqueur is very slow to clear, so be patient. When clear, two
  weeks or more, decant and add brown food dye previously mixed with a
  small amount of the liqueur. This liqueur should be a pale brown
  color so go very easy with the brown food coloring, lest you end up
  with a dark brown liqueur.

      2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Light cream
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Light corn syrup
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 oz Semisweet chocolate
      2 ts Solid vegetable shortening
 
  Combine sugar, salt, cream, butter, and corn syrup in a heavy 2
  1/2-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook at a
  gentle boil, stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches 238
  degrees F on the candy thermometer (soft ball stage).
  
  Remove from heat and cool, without stirring, until mixture is 110
  degrees F. Add vanilla and beat vigorously until candy is thick and
  loses its gloss. Quickly drop by teaspoonfuls into mounds on waxed
  paper. If the candy gets too stiff and dry before this is completed,
  knead each dropped candy between fingers or roll between the palms of
  the hands. It will soften and become more attractive. Let candy stand
  until firm to the touch.
  
  Meanwhile, melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering
  water. Stir in vegetable shortening. Spoon a small amount of chocolate
  glaze over each cream. Let stand until set. Wrap in plastic and store
  in refrigerator. Makes about 24 candies.

      Title: GRAND ORANGE-COGNAC LIQUEUR
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 1 Pint
 
    1/3 c  Orange zest*
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2 c  Cognac or French brandy
    1/2 ts Glycerin
 
  Grand Marnier is a classic orange liqueur to be savored. While
  ordinary brandy can be used, we recommend a good cognac or French
  brandy for best flavor. Ready in 5 to 6 months. Makes about 1 pint.
  
  Place zest and sugar in a small bowl. Mash and mix together with the
  back of a wooden spoon or a pestle. Continue mashing until sugar is
  absorbed into the orange zest and is no longer distinct. Place into
  aging container. Add cognac. Stir, cap and let age in a cool dark
  place 2 to 3 months, shaking monthly.
  
  After initial aging, pour through fine mesh strainer placed over
  medium bowl. Rinse out aging container. Pour glycerin into aging
  container and place cloth bag inside strainer. Pour liqueur through
  cloth bag. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Cap and age 3 more
  months before serving.
  
  *Note: Authentic Grand Marnier uses bitter Haitian oranges to produce
  its classic taste. You may use any type of orange peel you wish;
  however, a bitter type, such as Seville, is preferred for
  authenticity.

  "This recipe has been in the family since my great grandmother begun
  making it as a frugal jam for her family. Generations of
  Loewen/Howard women have made it as a mainstay of family breakfasts.
  My father particularly enjoyed the jam, but with a family of three
  sons, there seemed to be no one to carry on the tradition. That
  changed however, when my brother presented my father with a year's
  supply of tomato jam one Christmas. These are, after all, the 90s."
  
  Halve and seed orange and lemon. In food processir, finely shop fruit
  with rind. Transfer to heavy saucepan; add tomatoes and bring to a
  boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes or until rind is tender.
  Stir in pectin. Return to boil; boil for 1 minute, stirring. Stir in
  sugar; bring to a full rolling boil. Boil, stirring, for 1 minute.
  Remove from heat and skim off foam. Pour into hot sterlized jars,
  leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Seal jars; process in boiling water bath
  for 10 minutes. Store in cool, dark, dry place. MAKES: ABOUT 5 CUPS

      Title: GRANDMA MACKAY'S CRANBERRY BREAD
 Categories: Quick bread
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      2 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1 c  Sugar, granulated
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Orange juice (juice
           -of one large orange)
      2 tb Shortening
      1 tb Orange peel, grated
           -(one large orange)
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 c  Cranberries, halved
           -or chopped
      1 c  Walnuts or pecans,
           -chopped
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease the bottom, but not the sides,
  of two small loaf pans.
  
  In a large bowl, sift together all the dry ingredients (flour, sugar,
  baking powder, baking soda and salt). Blend very well.
  
  Mix together the orange juice, orange peel, melted shortening and
  beaten egg. Mix only enough to blend uniformly. Mix in the
  cranberries and the nuts; stir gently. Pour the mixture into the loaf
  pans. Push it to the corners, leaving the center slightly hollow.
  
  Bake about an hour at 350 degrees F.  The loaves are done when a
  toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool completely
  before cutting. Do not try to serve warm.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A festive cranberry-orange nut-bread -- My grandmother MacKay
  clipped this recipe from the 1951 edition of the Pillsbury Bake-Off
  competition recipes, and we've made it a family tradition ever since.
  From time to time my mother and I have both tried to improve on the
  recipe, but it appears that the recipe is already perfect; every
  variation we have ever tried has been disappointing by comparison.
  
  When I was a boy, before the invention of the food processor, making
  this bread required cutting the cranberries in half by hand, with a
  knife, and the person who brought 4 loaves of cranberry bread to the
  family Thanksgiving meal was more welcome than the person who brought
  the turkey. Now, between Baker's Secret loaf pans and Cuisinart
  slicer blades, you can knock out 8 perfect loaves of the stuff while
  watching one episode of Sesame Street.  My grandmother still cuts
  each cranberry in half with a paring knife, and hers still tastes
  better than mine. Yield: 2 small loaves.
  
  *  It takes practice to know when to stop mixing the dough. If you
  mix too much, the bread gets a chewy texture to it, whereas it should
  have a very crumbly consistency, like a muffin or cornbread.
  
  *  It really makes a difference in the texture of this bread to use a
  shortening that is solid at room temperature, like Crisco. It really
  makes a difference in the flavor to use fresh orange-peel and not
  powdered. I prefer walnuts to pecans.
  
  *  It might seem sensible to try to use the same orange for the peel
  and the juice, but it is really more trouble than it is worth to try
  to peel a juiced orange or juice a peeled orange. I usually use two
  oranges and eat the one that I took the peel from.
  
  *  This bread keeps well in the freezer. Specifically, it keeps from
  Thanksgiving to Christmas. It also survives quite well being mailed by
  parcel post from Indiana to Maryland.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation if you have a food processor, 2 hours
  baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  Measure carefully.

    1/2 lb SOFTENED BUTTER
      2 c  SUGAR
      4    EGGS
      3 c  SIFTED FLOUR
      3 ts BAKING POWDER
    1/2 ts SALT
      1 ts VANILLA
      1 c  MILK
      2 c  FLOURED BLUEBERRIES
      2 tb SUGAR
      1 ts CINNAMON
 
  MIX TOGETHER BUTTER, 2 CUPS SUGAR, 4 EGGS, BAKING POWDER, SALT,
  VANILLA AND MILK. ADD FLOUR AND MIX WELL. FOLD IN THE FLOURED
  BLUEBERRIES. LINE A 9" X 13" PAN WITH ALUMINUM FOIL. POUR THE BATTER
  INTO THE PAN AND SPRINKLE THE TOP WITH MIXTURE OF 2TB SUGAR AND 1 TS
  CINNAMON. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350. BAKE FOR 45 MINUTES. REMOVE FROM PAN.
  ALLOW TO COOL BEFORE REMOVING ALUMINUM FOIL. NOTE: COATING THE
  BLUEBERRIES WITH FLOUR STOPS THEM FROM SINKING IN THE
        BATTER. THE ALUMINUM FOIL PREVENTS THE CAKE FROM PULLING APART
        IF ANY OF THE BERRIES STICK, THIS PROVES OUT TO BE BETTER THAN
        GREESING THE PAN. GOOD LUCK, GRANDMA ROSE.

  guess you would add the water with the flour....

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Melted shortening
      1 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs, beaten
      1    Grated lemon (whole fruit,
           -not just peel)
      4 c  Flour (scant), sifted with:
      1 ts Salt
      3 ts Baking powder

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
           Fills 1/2 of dough recipe:
      2 lb Partly cooked pitted prunes
      6 tb Jelly/Jam
      1 c  Raisins
      1    Orange or 1/2 lemon
      1 c  Nuts
           Shake of cinnamon
 
  Combine the dough ingredients to form dough. Grind the filling
  ingredients together with a food grinder.
  
  Roll out the dough and cut circles with a glass. Put a spoonful of
  filling in the center of each circle, and fold up sides of the dough
  to form triangular filled cookies.
  
  Bake at 400 F until lightly browned.
  
  I haven't actually made this recipe, but I've been enjoying the
  hamentaschen for years. For poppyseed filling, I think I'd just use
  the solo filling from th can. I've made my own hamentaschen using
  various jams for filling, with some success. Good luck.

      6 md Potatoes
      1    Egg yolk
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2    All-purpose flour
 
  These are *not* fluffy dumplings as in chicken and dumplings. They
  are a "sturdy" potato dumpling served as a side dish to meat, and
  usually with a sweet sauerkraut/carraway/honey dish as the vegetable.
  
                  *                       *
                       *
  
  Boil peeled potatoes in small quantity of water. Drain potatoes
  thoroughly. Rice potatoes through hand held masher/ricer. Let
  potatoes cool. On floured board, gradually add flour working mixture
  into dough with hands. Shape potato mixture into a long roll and cut
  into 10 slices. Drop dumplings into boiling water and boil gently
  about 5 minutes.
  
  Drain dumplings on paper towel.  The dumplings are fully cooked after
  the boiling process, but traditionally, Czechoslovakians then melt
  butter in a heavy frying pan, and fry the dumplings until they are
  lightly browned on all sides.

      Title: GRANDMA'S BASIC WHITE SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Butter*
      1 sm Chopped shallot (about 2 tb)
      2 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Warm milk*
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/8 ts Fresh ground nutmeg*
 
  In a medium sauce pan melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the
  shallot and saute, stirring, for 3 minutes. Lower the heat, add the
  flour, and cook stirring, 3 minutes more or until the roux is golden
  and bubbling. Pour in the milk and bring it to a simmer, stirring
  constantly, for 5 minutes or until thickened and smooth. Add the
  salt, pepper and nutmeg. The recipe makes a scant 2 cup, but easily
  doubles if you need more. *We substitute unsalted butter (or Weight
  Watchers low-fat substitute) for Grandma's butter, and use skim milk
  or 2% lowfat instead of the whole milk she used, with no trouble at
  all.
