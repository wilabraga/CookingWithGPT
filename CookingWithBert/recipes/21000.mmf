           FILLING:
      6 lg Spy apples
      1 lg Bartlett pear
    1/2 c  Dried apricots
      2 ts Lemon juice
    1/3 c  Granulated sugar
      2 tb Cornstarch
      1 ts Cinnamon
           Pinch nutmeg
           PASTRY:
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
           Pinch salt
    1/3 c  Lard or unsalted butter,cold
           -cut into bits
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter, cold, cut
           -into bits
      1    Egg
    1/4 c  Water, cold
 
  Preheat the oven to 400øF.
  
  To make the filling, peel, core and slice the apples and pear. Chop
  the apricots coarsely (scissors work well).
  
  Mix the fruits together and then toss with the lemon juice, sugar,
  cornstarch, cinnamon and nutmeg. Arrange in a 13 x 9 inch casserole or
  baking dish (approximately 3 inches deep).
  
  To make the pastry, combine the flour with the salt. Cut in the lard
  and butter until they are in tiny pieces. Beat the egg with the water
  and sprinkle enough over the pastry so that you can gather the dough
  into a ball.  Reserve the remaining egg mixture. Roll out the dough
  to fit the top of the baking dish. Fit the pastry over the fruit
  mixture. Brush the top with remaining egg wash and prick the dough
  with a fork.
  
  Bake for 50 to 60 minutes.  If the top browns too much, reduce the
  heat for the last 20 minutes of the baking time. Serve warm. Yield:
  12 servings. Typed in MMFormat by cjhartlin@msn.com Source: Cooking

      Title: DEEP-DISH TURKEY POT PIE
 Categories: Casseroles
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------TURKEY MIXTURE----------------------------
  2 1/4 c  Chicken broth, defatted
    1/2 c  Chopped celery
    1/4 c  Chopped onions
      2 md Carrots, coarsely chopped
      3 tb Cornstarch
  1 3/4 c  Evaporated skim milk
      3 c  Cooked, chopped turkey
           -breast
      1 c  Frozen peas, thawed
    1/4 c  Snipped fresh parsley
    1/2 ts Dried sage

MMMMM------------------------PASTRY CRUST-----------------------------
      3    Sheets phyllo dough
 
  To Make the Turkey Mixture:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a
  medium saucepan, combine 2 cups of the broth, the celery, onions and
  carrots. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Cover and simmer
  about 5 minutes or until the veggies are tender.  In a custard cup,
  stir the remaining 1/4 cup of the broth and the cornstarch until
  smooth. Slowly stir this into the broth-veggie mxiture.  Then stir in
  the milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture comes to a
  boil. Reuce the heat. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Then stir in
  the turkey, peas, parsely and sage. Transfer the mixture to a shallow
  2-quart casserole.
  
  To Make the Pastry Crust:  Lay one sheet of the phyllo dough on top
  of the turkey mixture.  Spray the dough with no stick spray. Repeat
  layering and spraying the phyllo dough two more times. Fold or
  crumple the edges of the dough and tuck them inside the casserole
  dish. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown.
  
  I added potatoes, mixed veggies, tobasco sauce and some liquid smoke
  to enhance the flavor.  Very good and light. Even though the phyllo
  dough crust will get soft once you refrigerate it, it will get flaky
  again if you reheat it in the oven.

  hands, breaking up the pasta slightly and making sure the ingredients
  are well mixed. Form into 35 balls about the size of a walnut and fry
  in 350F fat until golden brown.
  
  Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and
  keep warm in a 150F oven while completing the frying process. To
  serve, place 4 to 6 crab balls on each plate with some of the panache
  next to them. Garnish with 2 avocado slices and a few sprigs of
  cilantro. Note: The crab mixture can be made the day before serving
  and kept refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic wrap. If the
  balls are fried in advance, or if there are leftovers, reheat them in
  a 400F oven for a few minutes to crisp.

      Title: DEEP-FRIED CRAB BALLS WITH VINEGAR DIP
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Fresh cooked crab meat
      2 oz Pork fat from loin
      6    Peeled water chestnuts
      1    Scallion
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Dry sherry
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Minced ginger root
      2 c  Deep-frying oil
           VINEGAR DIP:
      2 tb Black Chinjiang vinegar
      1 tb Yellow rice vinegar
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar
 
  You can serve this dish hot or cold.  We prefer the crab balls hot,
  when their exterior is crisp and the meat hot and moist. They also go
  better with the vinegar dip when hot. If you prefer to serve them
  cold or at room temperature, delete the dip, or substitute something
  like mustard and catsup.
  
  Preparation: If you're using food processor, crab and pork fat should
  be cold.  Cut pork fat into cubes. Trim and cut scallion into 1"
  sections, including greens. Using steel blade, place water chestnuts
  and scallion in bowl; pulse/start to chop vegetables.  Add crab meat
  and pork fat; pulse/start to mince.  Add eggs, sherry, salt, corn-
  starch and minced ginger. Pulse/start 3 or 4 times to blend. Don't
  overdo it; you don't want a puree.
  
  Deep-frying: In wok or deep-fryer, heat oil until bubbles form around
  a bamboo chopstick held upright in oil. Using teaspoon, form small
  ball of crab mixture. Test cooking temperature; it should brown and
  cook through in about 5 minutes; adjust heat if necessary. Proceed
  with deep-frying about 6 balls at a time; avoid crowding them. Drain
  on bamboo strainer or towel. If you can't serve them immediately,
  refry briefly to crisp skin. Avoid overcooking.
  
  Vinegar dip:  Mix ingredients in a shallow bowl; place on serving
  platter and surround with crab balls.

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Green bell pepper
      1    Red bell pepper
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless

MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking powder,
           -double-acting
    1/2 ts Vegetable oil

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1    Lemon
      3 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Cornstarch
      2 ts Water
           Parsley sprigs
 
  Wash and seed the peppers.  Cut each one into strips about 2 x 1/4
  inches. Cut the boneless chicken breast into strips about 3 x 1/2
  inches.
  
  Prepare the batter by mixing in a bowl the flour, cornstarch, baking
  powder, salt, water and oil. Stir until smooth.
  
  Cut half of the lemon into thin semicircular slices. Prepare the lemon
  sauce by squeezing the juice from the other half of the lemon and
  combining in a cup with the sugar and water. Stir well.
  
  Combine about 1 teaspoon cornstarch and about 2 teaspoon water in a
  second cup.  This mixture will be used later to thicken the lemon
  sauce. Dip each piece of chicken in the batter and let the excess
  drip back into the bowl.
  
  Deep fry the chicken in small batches.  It is best to use an electric
  deep fryer, but if this is not available, heat about 1 quart of
  vegetable oil in a wok or deep pan until it is very hot. Then add
  about 5 pieces of chicken at a time to the oil and cook, covered, for
  about 5 minutes or until a golden brown crust forms. Check once a
  minute to see if the pieces are sticking together, and if so,
  separate them. After each batch is finished, set aside on a paper
  towel to drain off the excess oil.
  
  Cook the lemon sauce by pouring the lemon-sugar mixture into a
  saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch-water mixture and
  stir until thickened.
  
  To please the eye as well as the palate, mix up the chicken and
  colored pepper pieces and pile on a plate. Top with sprigs of parsley
  and place the lemon slices around the outside of the plate. Put the
  hot lemon sauce in a cup so that people can pour it over their
  chicken just before eating, to keep it crispy.
  
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be
  done at the same time as the chicken.
  
  A nice-looking dish for company.  The deep-fried chicken pieces can
  also be served as party snacks instead of junk food.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Crispy chunks of chicken in sweet lemon sauce. Yield: Serves 2-3.
  
  : Difficulty:  With an electric deep fryer, easy; without one,
  moderate. : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the batter ingredients.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     36    Whole sage leaves
           -- washed and dried
           Hot oil for deep frying
           -- to depth of 1 inch

MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
      1 c  Lager beer
    2/3 c  All-purpose flour
           Salt & pepper; to taste
      1    Egg white; at room temp.
 
  Select whole, unblemished sage leaves with stems left on, for easy
  handling.
  
  Combine beer, flour, salt and pepper in small bowl until smooth.
  Batter should have the consistency of cream soup. Let stand at room
  temperature at least 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, beat the egg white until it is fairly stiff but not dry.
  Fold into batter.  Dip whole sage leaves in batter to coat both sides.
  
  Deep-fry in hot oil or shortening until crisp and golden brown on both
  sides.  Drain on paper towels; serve.
  
  Yield:  4 to 6 servings.
  
  Enright says that Chef Willy Brand, of Toronto's George Brown College,
  first tasted these when he worked in Switzerland, where the sage
  leaves were popular at cocktail parties. She also says that these are
  good served with selected cheeses, or with deep-fried wedges of
  camembert or brie and a tomato dipping sauce.

      Title: DEEP-FRIED SESAME SEED BALL - JIEN DUY
 Categories: Oriental, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Glutinous rice powder
    2/3 c  Boiling water
      2    Chinese brown slab sugar
           -(sticks)-

    1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
    1/2 c  Sweet red bean paste
    1/2 c  Sesame seeds
           Peanut oil for deep-frying
 
  PLACE THE GLUTINOUS RICE POWDER in a mixing bowl. Bring the water to
  a boil and add the sugar; stir until completely dissolved. Pour sugar
  water into the rice powder; stir until well mixed. Gather the dough
  into a ball and knead until smooth. Cut dough in half and roll each
  half into two 10-inch long rolls. Cut each roll into 10 pieces. Take
  one piece and roll into a ball. Flatten it and place a 1/2-inch round
  piece of sweet red paste into the center of dough. Fold over sides to
  enclose filling and roll into a ball. Repeat until all the balls are
  made. Wet your hands with water and roll one ball in your hands to
  moisten the ball. Dip the ball into a dish of sesame seeds until the
  entire surface is covered. Press lightly to help the seeds adhere.
  Add enough oil to a wok to a depth of 2 1/2-inches. Heat to 350F.
  Deep fry balls for 8 to 10 minutes. As they expand in the oil, take a
  pair of chopsticks and squeeze the balls to help them expand and fill
  with air. The balls should triple in size, float to the top of the
  oil and turn golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels. Makes
  about 20 balls.

      Title: DEEP-FRIED SQUID
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Squid, cleaned and cut into
           -rings
           Flour for coating, at least
           -3 cups
           Salt and pepper to taste
           Oil for deep frying. Peanut
           -oil is best.
 
  Deep-fried squid is one of the most popular seafood dishes in the
  world. It is made in almost every country where squid is eaten. Once
  you taste it, you'll see why.  The rings emerge juicy, sweet and
  crisp.
  
  Served with several dipping sauces, this dish makes an excellent hors
  d'oeuvre or main course.  This recipe calls for a dry coating. Wet
  coatings, such as tempura batter, are delicious, too, though they are
  a little more trouble to apply.
  
  Dry the rings thoroughly with paper towels.  Coat with flour, to
  which salt and pepper have been added.
  
  Heat oil to 350F in a deep-fat fryer or heavy casserole. If you don't
  have a temperature control or thermometer, you can guess at the
  temperature by dropping a few drops of water into the oil.  It should
  sizzle immediately on contact.  Plunge basket laden with one layer of
  squid into oil which should bubble vigorously on contact. If you
  don't have a basket for deep frying, use a large spoon or tongs to
  immerse squid in oil, and to remove. Fry until coating turns golden
  brown, about 3 or 4 minutes.
  
  Remove squid and drain.  Turn down heat to moderate until just before
  you are ready to cook the next batch; oil will overheat when the
  fryer is empty. Remove excess oil from squid with paper towels.
  
  Serve rings hot with any of the dipping sauces described below or with
  lemon wedges.  Cole slaw is a natural with deep fried squid.

  An easy recipe for venison backstrap is to cut it lengthwise into 3
  equal strips. Season to taste (we use salt, pepper and garlic powder)
  then roll each strip up, circle with a slice of bacon and secure with
  a toothpick. What you should have will look like a filet mignon and
  after you grill it rare over coals will taste twice as good.

      1 lb Mascarpone cheese
      2    7 oz pckgs dried ladyfingers
           --- (about 24)
      2 c  Brewed espresso; *see note

      1 sm Semisweet chocolate; to
           -shave
 
  Recipe by: haque@underground.irhe.upenn.edu (Amina Haque) * lightly
  flavored with about 4 TB amaretto, marsala, or any favorite lique
  
  1.  In a bowl, whisk together the sugar and egg yolks. Gradually add
  the mascarpone and continue stirring until the mixture becomes
  creamy. In another bowl, whip the egg whites to a meringue
  consistency (stiff peaks). Carefully fold the meringue into the
  mascarpone mixture.
  
  2.  Quickly and lightly dip enough ladyfingers or biscuits into the
  brewed espresso to line the bottom of an 8-by-8-inch pan or glass
  serving dish. Cover the ladyfingers or biscuits with one half of the
  mascarpone mixture, followed by a thorough dusting of cocoa and
  shaving of chocolate. Repeat the layering process. (If you prefer a
  less moist dessert, you can divide the layers into thirds, or dip
  your ladyfingers even faster....)
  
  3.  Once assembled, shake the pan lightly to settle the ingredients.
  Chill at least two hours (overnight is preferable) before serving.
  Cut into portions and serve.

      Title: DELICATE HOMEMADE PASTA
 Categories: Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour, whole wheat pastry
      1 c  Flour, unbleached
      1 ts Salt
      2    Eggs, large
      2 ts Olive oil
      2 tb Water, more as necessary
 
  Sift together the flours and salt and pour out on a clean, dry board.
  Shape into a mound, then make a well in the center with the "walls"
  of the flour even all around. Crack the eggs into the well and add
  the oil. Using a fork, mix the flour together with the egg mixture,
  keeping the "well" intact by cupping one hand around the wall of
  flour while you brush flour from the top of the wall into the well,
  incor-porating it into the egg mixture.  The mixture of eggs and
  flour will get very sticky; keep incorporating flour with the fork
  while you con-tinue to confine the flour with your other hand so it
  doesn't scatter itself all over the working surface.  (You won't be
  able to get all the flour incorporated, and some flakes of the
  mixture won't be absorbed, but don't be concerned with this small
  amount---you'll have plenty of pasta.)
  
  When you have incorporated all the flour you can into the egg mixture,
  sprinkle with the water.  This may make the mixture sticky. Sprinkle
  with a little more flour---just a little---so you can handle the
  dough, and mix the dough vigorously with your hands.  When the dough
  is smooth and elastic, knead it for 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a
  ball, wrap it in a damp towel, and let rest for 30 minutes to an hour.
  
  Divide the dough into eight. Roll out as thin as possible---start at
  the thickest setting your machine allows, and run each piece through
  many times, each time setting the machine one notch thinner. The
  dough will shrink back a little, so roll it thinner than you want it.
  Run through the cutters, or cut with a knife into the desired shapes,
  and place on waxed paper until ready to cook. If storing, allow to
  dry and wrap in plastic. Keep in a cool, dry place.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour, whole-wheat pastry
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Flour, unbleached
      2    Eggs
      2 ts Olive oil
      2 tb Water; (more as needed)
 
  Sift flours and salt together into a large mixing bowl or food
  processor. Add the eggs and oil, and work together until you have a
  moderately sticky lump (if working by hand) or a grainy mixture (if
  working with a food processor). Add 2 T. water, and work the dough
  until you have a fairly firm lump. Add a little more water or flour
  as needed to get a good-feeling texture. If working by hand, don't
  try to reincorporate the flakes that fall off the main lump. Knead
  the dough gently for 5 minutes, wrap in a damp dish towel, and let it
  rest 30 minutes to an hour. Divide the dough into 8 parts and roll
  out very thin with a rolling pin or pasta roller. It will thicken and
  shrink a bit after the rolling, so roll a little thinner than you
  want it to end up. Makes 24 lasagne noodles, or enough
  spaghetti/fettucine for 8.

 Categories: Breadmaker, Sourdough
      Yield: 1 Large loaf
 
           -TMPS67B    CLAUDIA WOODARD
  2 1/4 ts Yeast
  2 2/3 c  Bread flour ]
      1 c  Rye flour; plus 2 Tbsp
  2 1/4 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Caraway seeds
  1 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 ts Barley malt syrup
    1/3 c  Sourdough starter
      1 c  -water; plus 2 Tbsp.
 
  This bread really does taste just like deli rye.
   Follow your machine's instructions. It's such a good sourdough, you
  may have to cut back on the yeast. I made a loaf this morning and cut
  the yeast back from 2 tsp. to 1 1/2 tsp. and it still spilled over
  the pan.

      Title: DELICE AUX NOISETTES
 Categories: Desserts, Nuts, Kump
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    10-in prebaked quiche shell
  1 1/2 c  Hazelnuts
  1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 pn Cream of tartar
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 tb Vanilla
      2 lg Eggs
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Whip 1/2 cup of the cream in a chilled bowl or
  over ice till soft peaks form, then add the confectioners' sugar and
  vanilla and beat just to stiff peaks. Place in strainer lined with
  cheesecloth and set over a bowl. Place the hazelnuts on a tray in the
  oven for about 10 minutes. Do not let them burn. Take them out and
  skin them. Keep 1/2 cup of the nuts warm. In a stainless steel or
  aluminum saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the sugar and 3 tablespoons of
  water to boiling. Add a pinch of cream of tartar and continue cooking
  to a light brown color. Lightly oil a baking sheet with 1 to 2
  tablespoons of oil. When the syrup is a light brown, pour the 1/2 cup
  of warmed nuts into it and stir with a wooden spoon to coat the nuts
  evenly. Immediately pour them out onto the oiled baking sheet. Let
  cool, 10 minutes, to make nougatine. Grind the remaining 1 cup nuts
  with 3/4 cup of the sugar in a food processor to form nut butter.
  This will take from 6 to 10 minutes. The food processor may have to
  be scraped down from time to time, but the oils must emerge and it
  must be somewhat like a peanut butter. When the nougatine is cooled
  and hardened, chop it coarsely with a knife into pieces small enough
  to eat. Mix 1 cup of cream and the eggs together, add to nut butter
  and pour into a quiche shell. Sprinkle the nougatine over the top.
  Bake 25 to 35 minutes until browned and set. Serve the quiche tepid
  with dollops of whipped cream placed on the top with a tablespoon. Or
  decorate with whipped cream piped through a pastry bag.

 Categories: Chiles, Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Chicken breasts cut in
           Half with no bones
    1/2    Onions
      1 cl Garlic
      1 c  Cream
      5    Poblano chiles
    250 g  Parmesan cheese
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 tb Instant Coffee
      1 tb Vinegar
 
  Instructions
  
  Cook the chicken in medium pot with water, the onions, garlic and
  salt. 2. Place the chiles directly over the stove's grill and let
  them roast until they start to become black on both sides.
  Inmediately introduce the chiles in plastic bag and let them sweat
  for five minutes. 3. Now make an incision in the chiles, only large
  enough to take out all the veins and peel them so that all the burnt
  skin is off and they are green again. 4. Put the chiles in a small
  bowl with water, one teaspoon of soluble coffee and one tablespoon of
  vinegar. Let them sit for 1/2 hour to 1 hour. This extracts the
  capsine from the chile, reducing its hotness and making the more
  tasty. 5. Drain the chiles and rinse in water. Next, put in blender
  along with the cream, salt and pepper. 6. Put the chicken breast in a
  heat resistant container and pour the strained Poblano sauce.
  Sprinkle the parmesan cheese on top and dot with butter. 7. Bake for
  20 minutes aprox. at 200 degrees Celsius. Walt

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      1 c  (2 sticks) butter, softened
      1 c  Sugar
      3 lg Eggs
      2 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 ts Finely grated peeled
           -fresh gingerroot
      1 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Rum (opt.)

MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT GARLAND----------------------------
      2 c  Cranberry-juice cocktail
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Port or red wine
      1    Lemon, quartered
      2    Drops red food coloring
           -(opt.)
      2 sm Firm Anjou pears
      1 c  Water
     10    Thin strips orange peel
    1/4 c  Apple jelly
    1/2 c  Champagne grapes, preferably
           -in clusters (if not
           -available, substitute small
           -red seedless grapes)
 
  1. Prepare Cake, Heat oven to 325'F. Grease and flour a 10-inch ring
  mold or tube pan. In large bowl, with electric mixer at medium speed,
  beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a
  time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla and
  gingerroot until well blended.
  
  2. In small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. With mixer
  at low speed, beat flour mixture into butter mixture just until
  combined. Spread batter evenly in prepared pan and bake 30 to 35
  minutes or until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean.
  (Meanwhile, begin step 3.) Cool cake in pan on wire rack 10 minutes;
  invert the pan onto wire rack and unmold the cake. Sprinkle rum over
  cake, if desired, and cool completely.
  
  3. Prepare Fruit Garland: In 3-quart saucepan, combine cranberry
  juice, 1/2 C sugar, the port, 2 lemon quarters, and the food
  coloring, if desired. Heat to boiling over low heat; simmer, stirring
  occasionally while you prepare fruit. Peel one pear and cut in half
  vertically; remove core from both halves. Place one pear half in
  simmering juice mixture. After 5 minutes cut remaining pear half in
  wedges about 1/4-inch thick and add to juice mixture. Simmer 2
  minutes longer or until wedges are barely tender. Remove from heat
  and let pear half and wedges stand in juice mixture 1 hour or until
  they are rosecolored.
  
  4. In small saucepan, combine water, remaining 1/2 C sugar, and 2
  lemon quarters; heat to boiling, stirring occasionally. Avoiding the
  core, cut remaining pear, unpeeled, into 1/4-inch-thick wedges. Drop
  wedges in simmering sugar mixture and cook 2 to 3 minutes or until
  just tender; remove with slotted spoon to drain on paper towels and
  set aside.
  
  5. Heat sugar mixture to boiling over high heat; cook until mixture
  reduces to a heavy syrup about 12 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add
  orange-peel strips; cook until soft-about 5 minutes. With fork,
  remove strips to small dish and set aside to cool completely.
  
  6. To decorate cake, drain rose-colored pear half and wedges on paper
  towel; cut the pear half into 1/4-inch-thick wedges for slices that
  are white inside with a thin rose-colored band around edge. In small
  bowl in microwave or small saucepan over low heat, melt apple jelly.
  Brush top of cake with some jelly; arrange all 3 kinds of pear slices
  in a leaf-like garland on top of cake. Brush slices with remaining
  apple jelly. Arrange small clusters of grapes among pear slices and
  scatter candied orange-peel strips over top. Serve or cover loosely
  with plastic wrap and refrigerate until serving.

 Categories: Chili, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 oz Jerky
      3 tb Oil
      1 ts Whole cumin seed
      4 tb Chili powder
      1 ts Onion flakes
      1 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Cumin (powdered)
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
           Water as needed
           Flour for thickening
 
  Cut jerky into small, bite-sized pieces, remembering it will swell.
  In a heavy pot, simmer jerky and cumin seeds gently in moderately hot
  fat/oil for one to two minutes, stirring steadily to prevent burning.
  Add chili powder and continue to stir until well mixed. (Amount of
  chili powder will depend on the hotness of the jerky and your
  taste.)Add onion flakes, oregano, powdered cumin, garlic powder, and
  enough water to cover generously. Stir. Simmer one to two hours,
  adding water as the jerky takes it up. Allow chili to cool, and
  reheat before serving. If a thicker chili is prefered, add a little
  flour mixed to a paste with hot liquid from the pot and cook to
  desired consistency, stirring frequently. AUTHOR'S NOTE: Chances are
  no salt will be needed at all, since there will probably be enough in
  the jerky.

      Title: DENDENG PEDAS ('HOT' FRIED BEEF)
 Categories: Indonesian, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 kg (2 lb) topside (beef)

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Dark soya sauce

MMMMM---------------------------BUMBU--------------------------------
     10    Shallots
      4    Red chillis (or 2 tbs
           -Sambal Ulek)
      2 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt
      1 tb Lemon or fresh lime juice
 
  * Cut the beef fairly thin and trim it into small, square pieces.
  Marinate it for 1 hour or longer. Remember that pedas=hot++spicy hot!
  This is fried beef, with a robust flavour of chilli. Slice the
  shallots finely. Seed and slice the chillis.  Fry them in a
  tablespoonful of oil, in a wok, stirring all the time until they are
  golden brown. Add salt to taste. Keep hot. Put a tablespoonful of oil
  in a thick frying-pan, and fry the slices of meat a few at a time.
  Three minutes on each side will be ample*. When all the pieces are
  cooked, put them into the wok with the shallots and chilli. Heat, and
  mix well.  Sprinkle over the mixture 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice,
  or, better still, fresh lime juice. Stir, and add more salt if
  necessary.  Serve hot, with rice. * NOTE: In Indonesia, the meat is
  usually fried until crisp.  You can even buy sun-dried dendeng which
  only needs coating with bumbu and frying. Crisp dendeng can be rather
  tough, and I prefer it as described above; however, a purist might
  say that my recipe is not 'genuinely' Indonesian. Makes 6 servings.

  liquid is in your fruit), or until cake springs back from finger when
  lightly pressed on top.  Cool completely prior to frosting.
  
  2.  Frosting:  Cream together all frosting ingredients and spread over
  cooled cake.
  
  *  To lower the fat in the recipe, I often replace 1/2 to 3/4 cup of
  the oil with the juice left over from the peaches or pineapple (I use
  canned). It turns out fine. I have also used lowfat cream cheese in
  the frosting with success...it's just slightly less firm.

      Title: DENJANG JIEGE KEH (SPICED CRAB SOUP)
 Categories: Seafood, Korean
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Water
      2 tb Denjang paste
      1    Soft bean curd; in 1/2" cube
      1 ts Hot red chili powder; mix
           -with 1 tb water
      1 sl Ginger; size of a quarter
      1 sm Onion; sliced (1/3 cup)
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
      2    Crabs; each in 4 pieces
    1/2 c  Zucchini; sliced
 
  "The people of Kwangju where this recipe originates like their food
  salty and chili-hot. The fermented denjang paste provides the basis
  of the seasonings, aided by the chili and ginger. The fresh crabs
  absorb the flavors and the entire soup is enormously attractive. I
  went to my teacher's house one August in the middle of a three day
  pre-typhoon downpour. Sheets of water poured out of the sky as my
  taxi wended its way to the edge of town. The rice fields in this
  rice-growing region shimmered with an intense green as the rain
  engulfed the paddy. It had a wild, wet beauty but I was glad when I
  arrived and could concentrate in comfort on the crabs and the soup."
  
  1. Put the water and bean paste (denjang) into a pan and simmer over
  low heat, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the bean curd and cook for 5
  minutes more.
  
  2. Now add all the other ingredients and cook for 15 minutes more.
  Serve in 4 individual bowls with rice and an assortment of side
  dishes.

    2/3 c  Chopped fresh tomato
    1/2 c  Chopped green bell pepper
      1    Sliced green onion
    2/3 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
    1/4 c  Water
      1    Clove fresh garlic, minced
           -or crushed.
 
  Put the water in a skillet.  Toss in everything above except the
  grains. Cook down until the water's almost gone. (If you like the
  peppers less cooked add them after a couple of minutes.) Toss in the
  grain mix, stir, maybe add a grind or two of fresh pepper, serve.
  Serves two or one really hungry person.
  
  * The grain mix:  I steam 1/2 cup wild and brown basmati rice, 1/4 cup
  barley, 1/4 cup lentils and about 1/4 cup millet together, then use
  it in all sorts of recipes like this one.
  
  To make it even more like a Denver omelette, you could add no-fat
  cheese, but that makes such a mess of the skillet that I didn't
  bother!
  
  I liked this.  HAving leftovers for lunch just as soon as I get off
  line!

  while hot, drop a few at a time into the cheese mixture. Shake the
  bowl to ensure a good even coating, then transfer to a tray. Place

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Broccoli
      1    Jar spaghetti sauce
      1    Box "no yolk" (tm) "egg
           Noodles"
 
  bring "egg noodles" to a boil.  cook broccoli until tender but not
  mushy (i hate over-cooked broccoli). at the same time, heat up
  spaghetti sauce. when the noodles and broccoli are cooked to your
  preference, drain them and toss them together.  add sauce to taste.
  voila!
  
  the great thing about these noodles is that they're cholesterol free,
  and low fat, to boot! i'm sorry i don't have any exact measurements.
  i'm sure you can use your best judgement to gauge how much to
  prepare. i don't know how much fat is in this concoction; all i know
  is that the noodles are pretty low in fat grams, and that there are
  some pretty good vlf spaghetti sauces out there (provided you add
  enough basil and garlic!). happy spring, people!

 Categories: Canning, Desserts, Fruits, Harned 1994, Sauces
      Yield: 3 Pints
 
      2 pt Baskets ripe blueberries*
      6    To 9 tb. Armagnac**
           -- or to taste
      3 c  ;Water
  2 1/4 c  Sugar
 
  *About 6 cups, either wild or cultivated.
  
  **Cognac can be substituted for the Armagnac.
  
  Sort blueberries, discarding any that are damaged or overripe, then
  rinse and drain them.  Roll them on a terry towel to remove as much
  moisture as possible.
  
  Divide berries among 3 hot, clean pint canning jars, shaking them
  down as you go so they are lightly packed; leave 1/2" of headspace.
  Pour 2 to 3 tb. of Armagnac, according to taste, into each jar.
  
  Boil the water and sugar together in a large saucepan, uncovered, for
  3 minutes.  Fill the jars with the syrup, leaving 1/2" of headspace.
  Remove any bubbles, adding more syrup if necessary. Seal jars
  according to manufacturer's directions; process for 15 minutes in a
  boiling-water bath. Cool, label and store the jars.
  
  Keeps for at least a year in a cool pantry.
  
  Witty writes: "Blueberries in brandied syrup can launch several
  dessert possibilities.  Add spoonfuls of berries and syrup to fresh
  autumn fruit - diced apples or pears, or both and sliced blue plums -
  for an instant compote; ladle berries and syrup over ice cream, or
  angel cake, or a vanilla-flavored rice pudding or blanc mange; fill
  meringue shells with the berries and top them with whipped cream; or
  layer the fruit and syrup with lightly whipped fresh ricotta in
  parfait glasses."

      Title: DESSERT PIZZA SHELLS
 Categories: Crusts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 oz Active dry yeast
      2 tb Nonfat dry milk powder
      1 c  Very warm (120-125'F) water
      1 tb Sugar or honey
    1/2 c  Apple juice
      1 ts Salt
      5 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Lukewarm water (or more)
 
  Dissolve the yeast and the skim milk powder in the water. Add the
  sugar or honey and stir well to dissolve. Let this sit for about 10
  minutes. Add the apple juice and combine well.
  
  Put all of the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the salt and
  combine. Add the liquid mixture to the flour along with enough
  additional water to make a soft but not sticky dough. Knead the dough
  for 4 minutes if using a stand mixer; 8 minutes if kneading by hand.
  
  Divide the dough into balls of about 4 ounces each, put them on a
  floured sheet pan, cover the pan and allow to rise for 1 1/2 to 2
  hours, until doubled in bulk (or let rise, covered well, in the
  refrigerator overnight).
  
  Thickness:  To make a dessert pizza shell, the dough should be rolled
  thicker than that for a thin-crust pizza because it will be holding
  more weight. Go with a dough shell that is at least 1/8-inch thick.
  
  Forming: Pull up the sides to form a crust cuff or a well to hold the
  dessert toppings. The pizza shell should like like a pie or tart
  shell.
  
  Size: A four- or five-inch diameter pizza seems to be the best size,
  because it can be served as an individual dessert or as one for two
  people to share.
  
  Preparation: The best way to go from this point is to dock the crust
  and bake it completely. This baked crust will then be ready to take
  various toppings. In a few situations you might want to only par-bake
  the crust -- when doing a baked apple pizza, for example.
  
  Toppings: Cheeses: For the sake of simplicity and good taste, cheeses
  can be narrowed down to three: ricotta, mascarpone and cream cheese.
  Fruits: Just about any fruit will work. Using fresh fruit will
  control the moisture. Nuts: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, and pine nuts
  are favorites. Miscellaneous: Spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg and
  cloves work well. Crushed or ground amaretto cookies make a great
  topping over cheese and fruit. Chocolate chips, raisins and zest of
  oranges, lemons or limes can be used most effectively to pump up the
  flavor. A dusting of confectioners' sugar looks good and goes a long
  way in the taste department. Brushing or layering fruit preserves or
  a fruit glaze on the crust before toppings go on adds a lot of flavor
  and offers a wide range of taste possibilities.

      Title: DETERMINING YOUR ALTITUDE ABOVE SEA LEVEL
 Categories: Information, Canning
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  It is important to know your approximate elevation or altitude above
  sea level in order to determine a safe processing time for canned
  foods. Since the boiling temperature of liquid is lower at higher
  elevations, it is critical that additional time be given for the safe
  processing of foods at altitudes above sea level.
  
  It is not practical to include a list of altitudes in this guide,
  since there is wide variation within a State and even a county. For
  example, the State of Kansas has areas with altitudes varying between
  75 ft. to 4,039 ft. above sea level.  Kansas is not generally thought
  to have high altitudes, but there are many areas of the State where
  adjustments for altitude must be considered. Colorado, on the other
  hand, has people living in areas between 3,000 and 10,000 feet above
  sea level. They tend to be more conscious of the need to make
  altitude adjustments in the various processing schedules.  To list
  altitudes for specific counties may actually be misleading, due to
  the differences in geographic terrain with within a county.
  
  If you are unsure about the altitude where you will be canning foods,
  consult your county Extension agent. An alternative source of
  information would be your local district conservationist with the
  Soil Conservation Service.

      Title: DETMOLD SOURDOUGH BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Yeastfree, Sour, Yeast, Free
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Sourdough breads, although
           -lower in yeast content than
           -regular yeasted
           -breads, are never entirely
           -yeast-free.  An exception
           -to this is
           -sourdough bread using
           -Detmold* starter, a
           -specific strain of
           -lactobacillus which is able
           -to ferment flour.
 
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% PREPARATION
  OF STARTER, FIRST EVENING  %%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  
  It is best to make a new starter with every batch of bread. To 1/2 tsp
  DETMOLD powder, add 1 cup warm (85F) water and approximately 1 cup of
  flour, such that the mixture has the consistency of thick soup. Cover
  and keep in a warm place (e.g. the oven with light on) for 24 hours.
  There should tehn be bubbles in the mixture and a dark coloured
  liquid should have separated.
  
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%
  PREPARATION OF STARTER, SECOND EVENING  %%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  
  Add the starter mixture to 8 cups of warm water and optionally cooked
  sweet rice (see below).  Add sufficient flour to give the consistency
  of thick soup.  cover and let sit overnight in a warm place. The
  sponge can be made from water and flour only, but a much sweeter
  bread results from using a significant amount of cooked sweet rice.
  Twoo cups of dry sweet rice can be cooked in 8 cups of water and
  allowed to cool for the sweet rice ingredient mentioned above.
  
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% PREPARATION OF
  DOUGH, NEXT MORNING  %%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  
  The sponge has now risen, and 1 cup of this could be saved for
  subsequent starter if kept refrigerated and used within a few days.
  However, even in the refrigerator, the mixture will soon acquire wild
  yeasts and no longer be completely yeast-free.  Add to the risen
  starter more flour until it becomes a kneadable dough. This will
  require 12-18 cups of whole wheat flour.  Knead the dough as little
  as possible. Form the dough into loaves (about 5) and place into well
  oiled pans. Ordinary bread pans do work, but the bread tends to be
  thick crusted and to dry quickly. Round cans such as coffee cans, or
  48 oz juice cans give a bread that rises better and dries less
  quickly.  Cover the pans with aluminum foil and let them sit in a
  warm place for at least 4 hours.
  
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% BAKING BREAD, AFTERNOON
  %%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  
  Place the loaves in a cold oven and turn the oven to 350F. Bake for
  about 1-1/2 hours TOTAL oven time. Freeze the bread if it is not
  going to be used within the next few days. It is best to use freezer
  bags with the air drawn out, and double sealed.

  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Half-and-half, milk or
           -evaporated milk
 
  CAKE:
  
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Grease two 8-inch layer cake pans well,
  then dust then generously with cocoa. (This gives the cake layers a
  rich brown finish). Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt onto
  a piece of waxed paper and set it aside. Cream the butter until it is
  fluffy, add the sugar and vanilla, and continue beating until the
  batter is silvery and light. Beat the eggs in one by one, then add
  the sifted dry ingredients, alternately with the boiling water,
  beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and beating well after
  each addition. Divide the batter equally between the two pans,
  smoothing the tops. Bake the layers uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes,
  or until the layers feel spongy to the touch and begin to pull away
  from the sides of the pans. Cool the layers upright in their pans on
  wire racks for 10 minutes, then carefully loosen them around the
  edges with a spatula and turn them onto wire racks. Cool them
  completely.
  
  FOR THE FROSTING: Cream the butter until it is light, then add the
  confectioners' sugar gradually, beating all the while. Beat in the
  melted chocolate and vanilla, then add just enough cream to make the
  frosting a good consistency for spreading. Sandwich the two cake
  layers together with frosting, then frost the top and sides of the
  cake. Swirl the frosting into peaks and valleys. Makes about 8
  servings.

      Title: DEVIL'S FOOD WITH FUDGE FROSTING
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
  1 3/4 c  Sifted cake flour
    1/2 c  Cocoa powder (not a mix)
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
  1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Boiling water

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter
      2 c  Confectioners' sugar
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           - melted
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Half-and-half OR milk OR
           - evaporated milk
 
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Grease 2 8-inch layer cake pans well, then
  dust them generously with cocoa. (This gives the cake layers a rich
  brown finish). Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt onto a
  piece of waxed paper and set it aside. Cream the butter until it is
  fluffy, add the sugar and vanilla, and continue beating until the
  batter is silvery and light. Beat the eggs in one by one, then add
  the sifted dry ingredients, alternately with the boiling water,
  beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and beating well after
  each addition. Divide the batter equally between the two pans,
  smoothing the tops. Bake the layers uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes,
  or until the layers feel spongy to the touch and begin to pull away
  from the sides of the pans. Cool the layers upright in their pans on
  wire racks for 10 minutes, then carefully loosen them around the
  edges with a spatula and turn them onto wire racks. Cool them
  completely. FOR THE FROSTING: Cream the butter until it is light,
  then add the confectioners' sugar gradually, beating all the while.
  Beat in the melted chocolate and vanilla, then add just enough cream
  to make the frosting a good consistency for spreading. Sandwich the
  two cake layers together with frosting, then frost the top and sides
  of the cake. Swirl the frosting into peaks and valleys.

      Title: DEVILED CHICKEN WITH MUSTARD COATING
 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    Butterflied chickens
           The mustard and herb coating
           The cooking juices from the
           -chicken
      6 tb Dijon-style prepared mustard
  3 1/2 tb Finely minced shallot or
           -scallion
    1/2 ts Tarragon or mixed herbs
      4 dr Of hot pepper sauce
      2 c  Crumbs from fresh home-made
           -type white bread
 
  This is what I did with the basic butterflied chicken in the previous
  recipe.  Although there are a lot of instructions in these two
  recipes, they are really not complex and go together pretty quickly
  and easily. The coating is tangy and nicely crunchy.  Pay attention
  to it when broiling though++it can over brown easily.
  
  The chicken is broiled until almost done, then coated with mustard,
  herbs, and fresh bread crumbs for a crisp brown finish.
  
  The chickens.  Follow the preceding recipe, but broil the 2 chickens
  for only 10 rather than 15 minutes on the second (skin) side.
  
  Mustard and herb coating.  Drain the fat and juices out of the
  broiling pan into a small bowl; skim off and discard all but 2
  tablespoons of fat from the top of the juices. Blend the prepared
  mustard in another bowl with the minced shallot or scallion, herbs,
  and hot pepper sauce. Beat up the remaining juices; blend half of
  them into the mustard. Spread the mustard over the top (skin side) of
  the chicken, then pat on a coating of crumbs. Baste with the
  remaining juices. Ahead-of-time note: May be prepared somewhat ahead
  to this point; set aside at room temperature.
  
  Final cooking and serving.  Roast in the upper third level of a 400F
  oven for 10 to 12 minutes if cooking is delayed).
  
  When is it done?  The chicken is done when the drumsticks are tender
  if pressed, and the crumbs should brown nicely.
  
  Grilling note.  The crumb coating does not work for barbecuing since
  it will fall off and burn when you turn the chicken. However, you can
  use just the mustard and herb mixture, basted on during the last few
  minutes of cooking (beat a few tablespoons of oil into the mustard to
  take the place of chicken fat).
  
  Makes 8 servings.

    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
      1 pn Cayenne
      1 ts Whole cumin seeds, lightly
           -- crushed in a mortar &
           -- pestle
           Salt & pepper, as necessary
 
  Use only unhusked corn.  Soak in water for at least 30 minutes.
  Prepare either a grill or preheat an oven to 375F.
  
  While the corn is soaking, whisk together all the basting
  ingredients. When the corn has soaked for 30 minutes, carefully peel
  back the husks & remove the silk. Do not remove the husks entirely.
  Using a pastry brush, brush the oil over the corn.  Close up the
  husks & tie them closed. You need to ensure that the corn is well
  wrapped otherwise it will dry out as it grills.
  
  Place on grill & grill for 15 minutes, turning frequently. If you do
  not turn the corn, it will burn. Or, bake in the middle of the
  preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove husks & serve
  immediately. Or let cool & refrigerate & serve as part of a salad
  buffet.

      Title: DEVILLED EGGS
 Categories: Cheese, Breakfast
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Small onion, chopped
      1 oz Butter
      1 lb Tomatoes, skinned and choppd
           Or2 x 14oz tined, chopped
           Juice of 1/2 a lemon
      1 tb White wine vinegar
      2 tb Tomatoe puree
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 ts Brown sugar
    1/2 pt Chicken stock
      2 tb Chopped parsley
           Salt and pepper
      4 x  Crumpets or muffins
           Butter
      4    Eggs
 
  Hot, spicy sauces - devils - were popular in Britain in the 19th
  century. This sauce is served with poached eggs but goes equally well
  with fried eggs. The sauce can be made the night before and kept
  covered in the fridge. Warm through just before serving. An egg
  poacher can be used.
  
  Fry the onion in the butter for 3 mins. Add the tomatoes, lemon
  juice, half the vinegar, the tomato puree, Worcestershire sauce,
  brown sugar, stock, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to
  the boil and simmer gently for 20 mins until fairly thick. Keep the
  sauce warm.
  
  Lightly toast and butter the crumpets or muffins, and keep them warm.
  
  Half fill a deep frying pan with water. Add the rest of the vinegar,
  and bring to a gentle rolling boil. One at a time, crack each egg
  into a cup, and slide the egg into the bubbling water. Poach the eggs
  for 3 mins. Using two spoons, gather in the egg whites as they start
  to set, to give each egg a neat shape.
  
  Lift out the cooked eggs and drain on kitchen paper. Put each crumpet
  or muffin on a plate, and top with an egg. Spoon over the hot sauce,
  and serve immediately.

 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      3 tb Flour
      2 ts Cayenne pepper
           Salt to taste
    600 g  Whitefish
 
  Heat oil for deep-frying. Put 3 tablespoons plain flour in a paper or
  plastic bag and add 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper and salt to taste.
  
  In batches, put the whitebait (600 g in total) into the bag and shake
  until they are coated with seasoned flour. Shake off excess flour,
  then deep-fry for 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain well
  on kitchen paper.
  
  When all the whitebait have been cooked, put them back into the frying
  basket, reheat the oil and plunge the basket back into the hot oil for
  another couple of minutes until they are golden. (Depending on the
  capacity of your deep-fryer, you may have to do the second cooking in
  batches as well.) Drain and turn out into a serving dish lined
  thickly with paper napkins. Serve with wedges 6 of lemon.

 Categories: Spice paste, Chili, Baloo
      Yield: 35 Centiliter
 
    400 g  Red chilis such as cayenne
           -or Spanish pepper
     15 ml Honey
     15 ml "Liquid Smoke"
     25 ml Cognac
 
  For this recipe I use fresh red chiles (sold as "Spanish Peppers" in
  Sweden). Roast the chiles until the skin start to blacken. Let them
  cool. Skin and seed the chiles. Mix chiles, honey, cognac and salt in
  a food processor on high speed until you get a smooth paste. Boil the
  paste 5 minutes and fill it in small glass jars. Will keep for many
  months in the refrigerator. This makes a very hot chili paste. Use it
  with care.

  dish, simply pour batter in evenly. Microwave 1 layer at 50 percent
  power for 5 to 6 minutes, rotating 1/4 turn every 3 minutes. Increase
  power to High, microwave 2 to 5 minutes or until done. Let stand
  directly on counter top 5 to 10 minutes.
   *If solid chocolate is used, melt in glass measuring cup at 50
  percent power for 2 to 4 minutes per square. To soften pre-melted
  chocolate in the packets, microwave in envelope 10 seconds on High.
   VARIATIONS:
    1.  Chocolate Mint Cakes:  Substitute Peppermint flavoring for
  vanilla.

      Title: DHANA GHOSHT
 Categories: Meats, Indian
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Stewing lamb, trimmed
           -of fat and diced
      2 c  Yogurt (full-fat),
           -natural
      6    Garlic cloves, crushed
      4 ts Coriander, ground
      2    Lila murcha, (fresh
           -green chili peppers),
           -crushed
      4 ts Paprika
      4 ts Salt (or less)
      3 ts Ginger, coarsely crushed
      4 tb Cooking oil
           -(mustard oil is best)
      2 md Onions (or more
           -to taste)
      3 ts Cumin seeds
      1 ts Turmeric powder
      2 ts Black mustard seed
      2 ts Red chili powder
           -(also called cayenne
           -pepper or lal mirch)
      4 oz Coriander, fresh
 
  Dice the meat into bite-size cubes and soak in warm water for 2-3
  minutes.
  
  Mix the paprika, ground coriander, salt, crushed garlic and crushed
  green chilies with yogurt.  Drain the lamb and add to the yogurt
  marinade. Leave to marinate for at least six hours. Ideally it should
  marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
  
  Dice the onions into thin semi-circles.  In a large saucepan or a
  generous frying-pan,  heat the cooking oil over a high flame. Add the
  onions when the oil is hot enough to "steam." Reduce the heat to
  medium and stir occasionally.  Fry the onions until they change
  colour to a deep red/brown. This should take 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  At this point add the black mustard seeds and stir a few times. Then
  add the ginger, cumin seeds, red chilies and turmeric powder.
  Increase the heat and fry this "masala" for a couple of minutes. Add
  the marinated lamb to the masala and mix well.
  
  At this point you have two options, either to cook the meat on the
  stove or to bake it. Stove-top cooking takes less time but requires
  fairly constant stirring. It should be cooked in a covered saucepan
  on a low to medium flame for about 45 minutes. Add water if the sauce
  gets too dry and begins to stick. For baking, transfer it to an
  ovenproof casserole, cover it, and bake for 1 1/2 hours at 200
  degrees F. Check occasionally, though you are unlikely to need to add
  any water to the sauce.
  
  Finally, prepare and wash the fresh coriander in cold water. Only the
  leaves and the tender stems should be retained. Chop coarsely and mix
  well just before serving. If you don't have any fresh coriander, then
  mix in about 2-3 t of coriander powder. Serve with well buttered
  (boiled) rice or pita bread and fresh salad.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A popular North Indian lamb dish with coriander -- This is a family
  variation on a popular North Indian dish. I cook it whenever I could
  get hold of fresh coriander, which in Edinburgh is seldom.
  
  I don't know its authentic Indian name.  We simply call it "dhana
  lamb" as that's how its always cooked at home. Dhana means
  "coriander" in Gujarati. Yield: Serves 3-4.
  
  *  Take care not to burn the onions and don't overcook the masala just
  before mixing in the marinated meat.
  
  *  I think the dish tastes a lot better if it is baked. It's even
  better if cooked for a longer period at a lower temperature.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 day marinating, 2 1/2 hours
  cooking. : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  grams of fat and 45 calories.  The foods in the fat list contain
  mostly fat, although some item may also contain a small amount of
  protein. All fats are in calories and should be carefully measured.
  We all should eat unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats.
  
  Free foods: A free food is any food or drink that contains a fewer
  than 20 calories per serving.  You can eat as much as you want of
  those items that have no serving size specified. You may eat two or
  three servings per day of those items that have a specific serving
  size. Be sure to spread them out through the day.

  Place all ingredients in a blender and run the blender on the highest
  setting.  The shake will take longer in the blender than most people
  will expect because of the frozen strawberries. However, the frozen
  berries along with the banana provide the smooth thickness of this
  drink. Remember, this recipe is not a scientific formula. The
  quantities of each ingredient are very flexible, experiment until you

      Title: DIANA'S APPLE BUTTER
 Categories: Canning
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Filtered apple juice
      1 c  Dried apples (organic pref.)
      8 lb Firm cooking apples *
      1 c  Water
      1 tb Grated lemon zest
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      2 tb Light brown sugar
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
 
    *  Suggested apples:  Rome, Winesap, or Cortland.
      Bring the apple juice to a boil.  Place the apples in a glass or
  ceramic bowl and pour the hot apple juice over them. Let them sit
  until plump, about one hour. Peel, core, and chop fresh apples. Place
  them along with the plumped dried apples and juice in a large kettle
  or Dutch oven. Add approximately 1 cup of water or enough to come
  about 1 inch up the side of the pan. Bring the water to a gentle
  boil, cover, and reduce the heat. Simmer until the apples are soft,
  about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Check the water level often,
  adding more as needed, a tablespoon at a time, to prevent burning.
  Transfer the apples to a food processor or blender, and puree, taking
  care not to liquefy. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and stir in the
  lemon zest, lemon juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and
  allspice. Cook over low heat, stirring often, until the mixture
  thickens and reduces by about a third, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove
  from the heat and let cool completely. Refrigerate for at least 8
  hours before serving, allowing time for the flavors to meld. Store in
  the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. Makes about 4 cups. Source:

      Title: DICK MIALE PIZZA
 Categories: Diabetic, Pasta, Pies, Vegetables, Cheese
      Yield: 4 Sweet ones
 
      3 c  Unbleached white flour;
      2 c  Cracked wheat flour;
      2 pk Yeast;
      2 c  Water
      1 ts Salt;
 
  Most rustic types of bread consist of just flour, yeast, water and
  salt. I usually vary mine using a cracked wheat and also semolina
  flour. It seems to give the bread character. When I was under a
  Neurosurgeon, we were talking about sugars in the American diet and
  he said in Iran, the bread was made with out any sugars. I don't use
  a bread machine either. I bake mine on unglazeed quarry tiles and
  throw ice cubes in the bottom when I put the bread in. Gives it a
  nice rustic flavor and appearance. Sunday I made Pizza using 3 cups
  unbleached white flour and 2 cups cracked wheat flour along with 2
  pks yeast, 2 cup water and 1 tsp salt. (no fats-no sugar) Put veggies
  on the top, using fresh tomatoes. It made to large rounds. Again the
  only fat was the pam on the bottom and Pam on the top plus 1 Tbs.
  grating cheese for both pizzas. Worked out to be about 1/2 veggie and
  2 bread for 2 slices. Tasted a heck of a lot better than some of the
  commercial pizzas.

      Title: DICK STURZA'S BEEFSTEAK MARINARA
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Top round beef,fat trimmed
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Large onion,chopped
      2 ts Minced or pressed garlic
    1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms,thin sliced
      1 tb Butter/margarine/olive oil
      3 tb All-purpose flour
      1 cn Condensed beef consomme
    1/2 c  Dry wine
    1/4 c  Tomato paste
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      1 ts Dried basil leaves
      1 ts Dried oregano leaves
      1 cn Stewed tomatoes (14.5 oz)
           Hot cooked spaghetti
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Dick Sturza was all set for a juicy beef Stroganoff; the beef was
  cubed, the mushrooms were sliced, and all the other necessary
  ingredients were at hand. Then tragedy struck. The sour cream had
  gone over the hill, and there was no time to replace it. He
  improvised brilliantly by creating this beefsteak marinara, a
  casserole with satisfying complexity of flavor that can be started
  well before the dinner hour and will require little attention before
  serving time.
  =======================================================
  ============== ===
  1. Cut meat into 3/4" cubes. Pour 1 tablespoon oil into a 10-12"
  frying pan over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add meat, a
  portion at a time, cooking until well browned; stir often. Transfer
  meat with a slotted spoon to a shallow 3 to 3 1/2 quart casserole.
  2. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the frying pan along with onion, garlic,
  and mushrooms; stir often until onion is limp, about 10 minutes. With
  a slotted spoon, transfer mixture to casserole. Melt butter in frying
  pan, add flour, and stir until mixture bubbles. Smoothly blend in
  consomme, wine, tomato paste, parsley, basil, oregano, and tomatoes
  (break them up with a spoon) and liquid; stir until boiling.
  3. Mix sauce with ingredients in casserole. Cover tightly with foil
  and bake in a 350'F. oven until meat is very tender when pierced,
  about 2 1/2 hours. Serve over hot cooked spaghetti and add salt and
  pepper to taste. Makes 4-5 cups.

 Categories: Bbq sauces, Barbeque

    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Hot pepper sauce
    1/4 c  White vinegar
      1 c  Grape juice
 
  Combine all ingredients in a jar.  Tighten lid and shake until
  blended. This sauce may also be served at room temperature or heated.
  
  "This is a simple flavor enhancer", Remus tells me. "It's thin enough
  to read today's headlines through....but not so thin that a
  politician can." Remus Assures me that this authentic sauce can be
  used as a mop during cooking and as a dip after your meat has been
  taken off the grill.

 Categories: Diabetic, Allergy, Soups/stews, Crockpot, Low-fat/cal
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           WHITE SAUCE
  3 1/2 tb Instant milk powder
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
  1 1/4 c  Cold water
           TOMATO
      8 oz Can tomato sauce
      3 tb Chopped onion
      1 pn Dry rosemary, crumbled
      1 pn Fresh ground pepper
      1 pn Cayenne pepper
 
  This recipe is suitable for anyone who needs to know the exact
  contents of soup. OTHER OPTIONS: Regular recipes use about 1 1/2 Tb
  butter and 1 1/2 Tb flour per cup of milk for a medium white sauce.
  
  5 oz evaporated milk plus 5 oz water plus 1 Tb corn starch
  
  1 cup soy milk plus 1 Tb corn starch
  
  1 cup skim milk plus 1 Tb vegetable oil plus 1 Tb corn starch
  
  Put ingredients in a blender and process at high speed until well
  blended, or put ingredients in a jar and shake, or stir dry
  ingredients into cold milk with a whisk.
  
  Stir constantly in the top of a double boiler until the sauce
  thickens and simmers, then cook ten minutes. A medium saucepan set in
  a larger saucepan of simmering water works, too.
  
  Fresh tomatoes may be cooked with onion and seasoning, allowed to
  cool and pureed in a blender to make the sauce. If the tomato mixture
  is colder, add a little of the hot white sauce to bring it to the
  same temperature. This prevents curdling when the red mixture is
  gradually added back into the pot with the white sauce.
  
  Heat soup until it is hot enough to serve but do not allow it to boil.
  
  The same method may be used with 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked diced (or
  pureed) vegetables with cooking liquid used to make the sauce. Makes
  about 2 cups. Suggested vegetables:  potato with a little onion,
  carrot, zucchini, cabbage with a little ham, sauteed onion, mushroom,
  broccoli. Season to taste.

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE BISQUE----------------------------
           Salt and pepper to taste
      4 tb Cornstarch
      4 tb Non-fat powdered milk
    1/2 ts Cognac, Armagnac or brandy
      4    Basil leaves; minced
      1 ts Tarragon, minced
      1 tb Minced chives
 
  SEPARATE THE TAIL from the shrimp and remove the meat, reserving all
  shells, claws, heads and so forth. If you wish, devein the tails, then
  cover and refrigerate. Coarsely chop the heads and shells, reserving 4
  heads for decoration, if you have them. In a large saucepan, heat the
  oil over moderate heat, then add the shrimp shells and cook them.
  Stir slowly but continuously for 5 minutes. Add the vegetables and
  tomato puree and cook another 5 minutes, stirring. Add the wine and
  bring to the boil for 30 seconds, scraping the bottom to dissolve any
  coagulated juices. Add the water, bouillon cube, saffron and herb
  bouquet. Return to a simmer and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Pour the
  stock through a fine strainer into a bowl, pressing down on the
  vegetables and shrimp shells with a soup ladle to extract all of the
  liquid. (For a finer result, strain again through cheesecloth.)
  Return the stock to the boil. Moisten the cornstarch in a little cold
  water, then add it to the saucepan and boil for 4 minutes. Taste for
  salt and pepper. (The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and
  refrigerated.) Bring the stock to a simmer. Add the shrimp tails and
  let them cook a bare 2 minutes (for small or medium), or 3 minutes
  for extra large. Remove immediately with a slotted spoon and divide
  them among 4 heated soup plates. Pour the stock into a blender, add
  the powdered milk and cognac. Blend until smooth and homogeneous.
  Pour immediately into the soup plates over the shrimp tails. Garnish
  each dish with an equal amount of the herbs and a shrimp head
  (optional). This rich-tasting bisque has only 90 calories per serving.

      1 c  Sour Cream
      2 tb Dill weed
      2 tb Onion Flakes
      2 tb Parsley Flakes
 
  Start the day before, or atleast early in the day to serve in the
  evening. The dry ingredients need time to soften, and get friendly.
  Mix all ingredients and refrigerate over night.
  
  Carve out the bread  to make a bowl, saving the bread to dip into the
  sauce.
  
  When ready to serve, put the dip inside the bread, arange the bread
  pieces around the 'bowl'. When the pieces are gone, slice, rip, or
  tear the remaining crust and eat.
  
  We had a bakery in Baltimore that made a great Sweedish/Onion Rye,
  although that was the name on the bread, they claimed that there was
  nothing special about it. I have served it with plain 'store bought'
  rye, the round loaves and with my own home made rye.

      Title: DILL DRESSING
 Categories: Seasonings, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
  1 1/2 tb Dijon-style mustard
      3 tb White wine or herb vinegar
    1/3 c  Olive oil
    1/3 c  Chopped dill
    1/4 c  Chopped chives
           Chopped tarragon leaves
           -- (from 3-4 sprigs)
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  "I offer this dressing as an example of how well dill combines with
  other herbs and how many foods it can complement. Try it with carrot
  and cabbage slaw, with green salad, beet salad, and composed salads
  containing raw fennel or steamed asparagus or cauliflower. It makes a
  delicious and different dipping sauce for steamed artichokes and
  gives new interest and flavor to chicken, fish, and meat salads ~-
  it's surprisingly tasty with canned tuna.  You may substitute chervil
  or basil for the tarragon and garlic chives for the chives.  Using an
  herb vinegar containing the chosen herb heightens the flavor."  --
  Carolyn Dille <--[honest! -K.M.]
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Mix the mustard with the vinegar in a bowl.
  Whisk in the olive oil, then stir in the dill, chives, and tarragon.
  Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a little more vinegar or
  oil if you like.

      Title: DILLY GREEN BEANS
 Categories: Pickles, Vegetables, Appetizers, Canning
      Yield: 7 Pint jars
 
      4 lb Table perfect whole green
           -beans
  1 3/4 ts Crushed dried HOT red pepper
  3 1/2 ts Dried dill seed, OR 7 fresh
           -dill heads
      7    Cloves fresh garlic
      5 c  Vinegar
      5 c  Water
      1 c  Less 1 tablespoon pickling
           -salt (non-iodized)
 
  Wash beans thoroughly, remove stems and tips, and cut them as much as
  possible in uniform lengths to allow them to stand upright in 1-pint
  canning jars, coming to the shoulder of the jar.  Have jars clean and
  very hot, and lids and sealers ready in scalding water.  In each jar
  place 1 dill head or 1/2 teaspoon dill seed, add 1 garlic clove and
  1/4 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper.  Pack beans upright in jars,
  leaving 1 inch of headroom.  Heat together the water. vinegar and
  salt; when the mixture boils, pour it over the beans, filling each
  jar to 1/2 inch from the top. Run a plastic knife down and around to
  remove trapped air, adjust lids, and process in a 185F. bath for 10
  minutes after the water in the canner returns to a simmer.  Remove
  jars, complete seals if necessary.
  
  The beans are almost garden-crisp, but the high acidity of the vinegar
  allows this boiling-water bath to be safe for a low acid food.
  
  If you substitute ground cayenne pepper for the crushed hot red
  pepper, halve the amount of cayenne: use only 1/8 teaspoon cayenne to
  each jar.
  
  Wait at least two weeks for these beans to develop their flavor.

  NOTE:  I prefer to put in one whole dried or fresh (preferably)
  serrano or Cayenne type pepper.  It will not make the beans too
  spicy, but will add a delightful tang, much as commercial pickled
  "hot" okra, which is not really hot to my leather palate.  JMH

      2 ts Spicy brown bean sauce
      3 ts Hosin sauce

MMMMM--------------------------WRAPPER-------------------------------
      1 pk Wonton skins
 
  in a large bowl, mix meat well with remaining BASIC ingredients. mix
  until smooth.
  
  Separate mix into four equal parts.  For each part, add one of the
  EXTRA condiments -- mix well.
  
  To stuff the dumplings, put about one overflowing teaspoon or pecan
  sized ball into a wonton skin.  Fold into shape. Possible shapes are
  purse , fish , chocolate kiss, nurses cap, or whatever. Parts of the
  wonton skin that are sticking out may get tough, so keep this to a
  minimum. Use a different shape for each condiment so that you will
  know what is what.
  
  To cook, place on top of lettuce leaf on steam rack ( the leaf helps
  prevent sticking).  Be very careful not to let them touch each other
  or else they will stick. Steam for 20 minutes. Eat hot. Can be frozen
  and reheated in microwave.

      Title: DINAH SHORE'S RICE PUDDING
 Categories: Desserts, Snacks
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Regular rice
      1 c  Water (slightly salted)
      1 qt Whole milk
    1/4 c  Butter
      3 ea Eggs
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Raisins
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      3 tb Sugar
      1 tb Cinnamon
 
  Slowly pour rice into rapidly boiling, slightly salted water in a
  large pot. DO NOT STIR! Cover tightly and cook exactly seven minutes,
  at which time all the water will be absorbed and the rice will be
  slightly undone.
  
  Add the milk and butter; stir a little. Bring to a boil, cover and
  cook slowly over a low flame for one hour.
  
  Meanwhile, beat eggs; add 1/2 up sugar, raisins and vanilla. pour the
  mixture into the rice, stiring slowly until the rice starts to
  thicken.
  
  Serve hot, warm or cold with a mixture of the cinnamon and remaining
  sugar sprinkled lightly and evenly over the top.
  
  MARGIE'S NOTES: As printed the pudding comes out very sweet, and with
  too many raisins for my taste. So I change the rice from 1/2 cup to 1
  cup, and change the water to 2 cups. This of course changes the
  servings to more, but with Gary around, it all goes anyway.

  into 1/4" thick disks. Dry between paper towels. Rub large cast-iron
  (yes indeed, a well used one at that) skillet with cut edge of garlic
  clove. Melt 3T butter. Add onion, toss in potatoes and saute over
  high heat, 3 mins, flipping and separating to coat evenly. Arrange
  disks in an overlapping pattern in pan. Dot with remaining butter,

      Title: DINER MASHED POTATOES
 Categories: Potatoes, Mash
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------SQUARE MEALS-----------------------------
      6    Russet potatoes
      6 tb Sweet butter
           Salt and pepper
    3/4 c  Warmed milk
 
  ***These are indeed hand mashed, not whipped or riced. Potatoes should
  never be allowed to cool once they are put into the pot to cook.
  Always have the milk warmed. Prepare them right before serving so
  they're piping hot. Don't cut the potatoes too small prior to
  cooking, they'll be mushy. Peel potatoes, and boil until tender.
  Drain, return to pot over med heat, tossing and stirring until all
  moisture is gone. Mash with a masher, adding butter and salt when
  they are clear of lumps. While mixing vigorously with a heavy whisk,
  add warm milk. The more you beat, the fluffier they will be. Serve
  immediately, garnished with pepper and pats of butter. Note: if they
  are to accompany Diner Meatloaf, serve potatoes with an ice cream
  scoop. Plop a scoopful on the plate next to the meat, then flip the
  scoop over and use its rounded surface to indent a crater in the top
  of the potato globe. Hence the name, Crater Potatoes. The crater is
  for the gravy.

      Title: DINNER CREPES WITH MUSHROOM & WALNUT FILLIN
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 9 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------THE SAUCE------------------------------
      1 tb Vegetable oil, cold-pressed
      1 tb Flour, pastry, whole wheat
      1 c  Soymilk, mild; hot
  1 1/2 c  Tomato Sauce (see recipe)

MMMMM------------------------THE FILLING-----------------------------
      2 ts Vegetable oil, cold-pressed
    3/4 lb Mushrooms; coarsely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
    1/4 ts Thyme
    1/4 ts Basil
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
    3/4 c  Walnuts; chopped

MMMMM-------------------------THE CREPES------------------------------
    3/4 c  Flour, pastry, whole wheat
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Vegetable oil, cold pressed
  1 1/4 c  Soymilk, mild
 
   1. To prepare the sauce, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small saucepan,
  add the flour and whisk while cooking for 1 minute. Remove from the
  heat and pour in the hot soymilk all at once. Whisk briskly and
  return to the heat. Bring to a boil,continuing to whisk, and cook for
  2 minutes mor or until the sauce has thickened. If lumps appear
  during cooking, beat with an eggbeater until smooth. Remove 1/4 cup
  of this white sauce and reserve for use in the filling. Combine the
  rest of the white sauce with the Tomato Sauce and reheat just before
  serving.
  
   2. To prepare the filling, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large
  skillet and add the mushrooms, garlic, thyme, basil, salt and pepper.
  Mix well, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Remove the cover, add the
  walnuts and cook a few minutes more to absorb the extra liquid.
  Combine with the reserved white sauce.
  
   3. Prepare the crepes last. Sift together the flour and salt.
  Combine 2 tablespoons of oil and soymilk and mix well. Pour the
  soymilk mixture into the flour and mix well. If there are small
  lumps, beat with an egg beater for 30 seconds, not more. Heat an
  8-inch, nonstick, coated skillet, or coat an uncoated sillet with a
  thin film of lecithin. When a drop of water sizzles on the skillet,
  the skillet is ready to cook the crepes. Pour a couple of tablespoons
  of the batter into the skillet, immediately tipping the skillet
  around in all directions to coat the bottom completely. Cook for
  about 1 minute or until the crepe is golden brown. Loosen the edges
  of the crepe from the skillet and turn over with a spatula. Cook for
  another minute. Repeat until all the batter is used up. Stack the
  crepes on a dish until ready to use.
  
   4.  Lay a row of filling down the center of each crepe and roll up.
  Place them side by side in a serving dish, cover with warm sauce and
  serve.

      Title: DINNER PARTY PAELLA
 Categories: Poultry, Sausages, Fish*shell, Casseroles, Spanish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Chorizo sausage
  1 3/4 lb Chicken legs
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Saffron threads
      3 c  Chicken stock, warm
      1    Onion, chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
     28 oz Canned tomatoes
      1 sm Sweet green pepper, diced
  1 1/2 c  Short-grain rice
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/2 c  Frozen peas
    3/4 lb Large raw shrimp
    3/4 lb Mussels
      2    Green onions, minced
      8    Lemon wedges
 
  Authentic Spanish paella gets its name from the shallow two-handled
  pan in which it is cooked. There are only three 'must have'
  ingredients - short-grain rice for its velvety creaminess, saffron
  for its taste and golden hue, plus olive oil - most paellas include a
  colourful selection of sweet peppers, green peas, seafood, chicken
  and spicy chorizo sausage, which simmers to doneness as the rice
  plumps.
  
  1. Cut sausage into 1/2-inch thick slices. Remove skin from chicken;
  trim off fat. Using sharp heave knife, cut through chicken leg at
  joint to separate thigh from drumstick.
  
  2. In large paella pan or deep wide skillet, hat oil over high heat;
  cook sausage, stirring, for 2 minutes or until browned. Remove to
  platter. Reduce heat to medium. Add chicken and cook for 7-10 minutes
  per side or until evenly browned. Add to platter.
  
  3. Stir saffron into chicken stock; set aside to soften. Add onion and
  garlic to pan; cook, stirring, for 4 minutes or until softened. Add
  stock mixture, tomatoes and green pepper; bring to boil, breaking up
  tomatoes with back of spoon and stirring to scrape up any brown bits
  from bottom of pan [deglaze].
  
  4. Stir in rice, salt and pepper; reduce heat to low. Add chicken;
  simmer gently, stirring often, for 20 minutes. Gently stir in peas
  and sausage.
  
  5. Meanwhile, peel and devein shrimp. Scrub mussels under running
  water. With shears, trim off beards. Discard any mussels with cracked
  shells or ones that do not close when tapped.
  
  6. Nestle shrimp and mussels in rice until almost covered; cook for
  7-10 minutes or until rice is tender, shrimp are pink and mussels are
  open. Discard any mussels that do not open.
  
  Garnish with onions and lemon.
  
  Test Kitchen tip: you can use clams instead of mussels, omit the
  seafood altogether and double up the chicken, or replace chorizo with
  any spicy sausage.
  
  To make a fluffier paella with parboiled long-grain rice: cook,
  covered adding 1/2 cup more stock near end of cooking to prevent
  sticking. Garnish with trimmed fresh artichoke brushed with lemon
  juice to prevent browning.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     10    Sheets phyllo (oil-free)
      2    Cloves garlic minced
      1 ts Chopped basil (I used the
           -dry kind)
      1 pk Frozen spinach (the boxed
           -kind)
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs

           -cooking spray
           -pepper
      5 tb Ricotta (fat-free)
      5 ts Mozzarella (fat-free)
 
  I nuked the spinach 5 minutes on high, and while it was doing, I
  sauted the garlic in a skillet. When the spinach was done, I added
  it, the bread crumbs, the parmesan, the pepper, and the basil. When
  the water was pretty much gone, I cut the phyllo sheets in half, then
  lay down one sheet, sprayed with a little spray, put down another
  sheet, sprayed, until four half sheets were down. Then I took 1/5 of
  the spinach mixture, then put on a tablespoon of the ricotta, and a
  teaspoon of the mozzarella. Then I rolled it, sprayed it once more
  lightly, then started on the next "roll." Then I baked em until they
  were golden at about 350. They came out pretty good too.
  
  Well, hey, for spontaneous cooking, I was excited. =-)

  To dress up dips in holiday style, serve them with festive flair.
  Leave your serving bowls on the shelf and try one of these fresh
  ideas.
  
  PARTY-PERFECT PEPPER POTS: Start with a large red, yellow or green
  pepper. Place the pepper on its side and cut a large slice from the
  top, forming an opening that's large enough to dip into easily.
  Remove the seeds and membranes and fill the pepper with your favorite
  dip.
  
  COLORFUL CABBAGE CUPS: Cut a thin slice off the stem end of a red or
  green cabbage so it will be upright. Using a small, sharp knife, cut
  a "bowl" in the top of the cabbage and tuck in a small glass bowl.
  Fill the bowl with your favorite. Save the cabbage you've removed for
  coleslaw, or toss it into a salad.
  
  BEAUTIFUL BREAD BOWL: Cut a thick slice off the top of a small round
  loaf of bread and hollow out the bread, leaving a 1/2-1" thick shell.
  Fill the bread bowl with your favorite dip. Cut the top slice and the
  bread you've removed from the inside into bite-size cubes to use as
  dippers. Works great with classic Pace Con Queso Dip.

      1 c  Currants or raisins

      1    To 6 cloves garlic, minced

MMMMM----------------------AIOLI MAYONNAISE---------------------------
      4    Cloves garlic
      2    To 3 raw egg yolks
           Salt and pepper to taste
      2 c  Olive oil
      2 tb Lemon juice or vinegar
      1 tb To 2 tb water or additional
           -lemon juice
    1/2 ts Dijon mustard (optional)

MMMMM------------------TAMARIND-RAISIN CHUTNEY-----------------------
 
  Puree all the ingredients in a food processor or blender. Adjust
  tartness and spiciness to taste.
  
  LEMON-GARLIC BUTTER:
  
  Fry garlic in 1 Tb of butter until lightly browned. Add rest of
  butter and lemon.  When butter melts, sauce is ready.
  
  ROUGHLY-CHOPPED GARLIC:
  
  Actually, this is not a sauce, but it was such a hit at one squid
  party that I am including it here.
  
  Throw in a handful of chopped garlic 1 minute before the squid rings
  are ready to come out.  Remove golden brown garlic with a mesh scoop
  after you take out the squid. Be sure you get all the pieces out.
  
  Anything left in the oil will burn and impart a bitter flavor to the
  next batch of squid.
  
  AIOLI MAYONNAISE:
  
  This French garlic mayonnaise recipe is from The Book of Garlic. It
  makes a great dipping sauce for squid. You can make it in a blender
  for speed, but it tastes better made the authentic way.
  
  Peel the garlic and pound in a mortar until smooth. Add the egg yolks
  and seasoning.  Continue pounding until the paste is smooth. Then
  beat in lemon juice with a whisk. Start adding the oil a drop at a
  time while continuing to whisk.  If you use a blender, whirl the
  garlic, lemon juice and egg yolks for about a minute until smooth and
  then add a slow, thin stream of oil while blender is still on high.
  Do not over liquefy! The sauce should be thick like mayonnaise. If
  the sauce gets too thick, add water or lemon juice.
  
  Makes about 3 cups.

 Categories: Dips
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Stick (1/2 cup) butter or
           -margarine, softened
      1 c  Cottage cheese
 
  With carrots, celery, green pepper strips, cucumber slices, cherry
  tomatoes, cauliflower pieces or crackers, try any of the following:
  
  CHEESE SPREAD
  
  garlic powder
  
  Blend shortening with cottage cheese. A blender or baby food grinder
  will give you a smoother consistency than whipping with a fork. Add
  garlic powder to taste. Refrigerate in a covered container.
  
  DIP IT AGAIN
  
  1 (8 oz) container of plain yogurt 1 cup sour cream 1 pkg onion soup
  mix
  
  Combine and chill before serving.
  
  BETTER-WITH-BUTTERMILK DIP
  
  1 cup buttermilk 2 cups mayonnaise 1 cup sour cream or yogurt 1
  envelope Ranch style dressing mix
  
  Stir together and chill. For use as salad dressing, substitute a
  second cup of buttermilk for the sour cream or yogurt.
  
  Hint: Use cucumber "coins" instead of crackers.
  
  OTHER QUICK DIPPIES that make up in small quantities:
  
  * Blend 1/3 to 1/2 of a mashed banana with 2 or 3 tsps of mayonnaise.
  
  * Whipe together 1 tsp of smooth peanut butter with 1 tsp of
  mayonnaise. If still too thick, add a few drops of milk.
  
  * Mix 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of honey or sugar to 1 or 2
  tsp of mayonnaise.
  
  CUTTING UP WITH KIDS
  
  Have your children help you cut up green onions, parsley, lettuce,
  cheese slices, fruit, etc., using a scissors instead of a knife.
  Using a scissors helps coordination (YES!) and keeps them busy for a
  _long_ time!
  
  CHERRY BALLS
  
  Stuff whole (or half) cherry tomatoes with cream cheese, a cheese
  spread, egg salad or tuna salad.
  
  Actually thinking of snacks as hors d'oeuvres - rather than desserts
  ~ will open up a whole new way of looking at this category.

      Title: DIPS INFO (1 OF 9)
 Categories: Dips, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  DIPS Dictionary follows
      1 x  (This is Part 1 of 9)
 
  In this file, I will try and give some ideas about what you can use
  for the dips in the other files that I will be posting. ********* *
  BASES * ********* Although dips come in countless varieties, most
  start with one of the following bases, to which seasonings and
  ingredients are added to give each dip its own distinctive flavor and
  personality. Each base has it own character and is particularly
  suited in bringing out the best of the ingredients that are added.
  Likewise, the base will influence what kind of dipper is called for.
  SOUR CREAM: The classic base of the good old-fashioned all-American
  chip dip, sour cream is a perennial favorite because it mixes so well
  with a wide range of flavorings. Its smooth consistency and slightly
  tangy flavor make it a good companion for veggies of all sorts, and
  its stark whiteness simply begs for the addition of colorful specks.
  Sour cream dips should be thoroughly chilled before serving time to
  allow the flavors of all the other ingredients to blend well into the
  sour cream. People on low-fat diets can be consoled by the knowledge
  that yogurt can be easily substituted for the sour cream in most
  cases. CREAM CHEESE: Cream cheese added to sour cream is the royalty
  of dip bases as far as I am concerned.  The tow are perfect foils for
  each other's inherent tastes, resulting in a neutral base that allows
  the flavor of other ingredients to stand out.  The addition of cream
  cheese to sour cream also thickens the mixture sufficiently sot that
  heavier ingredients (such as diced veggies) will float in the dip
  instead of sinking to the bottom of the bowl.  (NOTE:  Don't try to
  use cream cheese alone as a base for dry ingredients.  It will most
  likely do in even the most sturdiest of dippers unless it's mixed
  with something more liquid.) Buy the cream cheese in block form.  The
  whipped variety in the tub has air whipped into it, and it will play
  havoc with your measurements.  Before blending with other
  ingredients, let the cream cheese soften to room temperature and then
  "cream" it--mash it to a smooth consistency with a sturdy spoon in a
  mixing bowl.  NOTE: this is fairly easy to do by hand once the cheese
  has softened.) MAYONNAISE: The traditional dressing of Europe,
  mayonnaise is now at home as a base for New World dips. Its natural
  blandness makes an ideal backdrop for herb flavorings, which it tends
  to absorb quickly. Mayonnaise is often successfully teamed with sour
  cream. Mayonnaise based dips are best with veggie and seafood dippers
  as well as with any meat that you might use in a salad. Mayo dips
  must be watched carefully and ABSOLUTELY cannot be left out in the
  heat, as the raw egg yolks in the mayonnaise give it a very short
  life span. Although you certainly can use the convienent store-bought
  kind, you might want to try this recipe for homemade mayonnaise--it
  tastes better and is relatively easy to make. The dip recipes in the
  other files will assume that you are using the store-bought kind. If
  you use this recipe, omit any additional oil called for in the
  recipes. HOMEMADE MAYONNAISE:
    2 1/2    Tsp Lemon Juice
        3    Large Egg Yolks
      1/8    Tsp White Pepper
      1/8    Tsp Salt
    1 1/4    Cup Vegetable Oil USING A FOOD PROCESSOR: Fit a food
  processor with the steel blade and place the egg yolks, lemon juice,
  pepper, and salt in the bowl. Blend until smooth. While continuing to
  process, very slowly drizzle the oil through the feed tube. Continue
  until all of the oil is used and the mayonnaise thickens. BY HAND:
  Using a whisk, beat the egg yolks, lemon juice, pepper and salt until
  well blended. Slowly add the oil by the 1/2 tsp, whisking constantly.
  Continue until all of the oil is used and the mayonnaise is
  thickened. Makes 1 3/4 Cups Of mayonnaise YOGURT AND COTTAGE CHEESE:
  Yogurt is often the costar of a dip base, used either to thin the
  mixture or to impart a tangier flavor.  Be sure to use the plain,
  unflavored yogurt as Vanilla will NOT do. A lot of people are partial
  to using cottage cheese, which adds an interesting texture to dips. A
  dip base that includes cottage cheese holds up with the addition of
  large chunks of vegetables and works particularly well with cracker
  dippers. In some recipes the cottage cheese must first be creamed, as
  you would the cream cheese. (In this case you are breaking up the
  curds.) BEANS: Bean dips came onto the scene with the widespread
  emergence of ethnic food some 20 years ago and have remained
  extremely popular ever since. Beans mix well with cheeses and strong
  spices, producing distinctive earthy-colored dips that are best
  accompanied by chip and bread dippers. As most bean dips have ethnic
  roots, you should pair them with dippers of similar origins. (Middle
  Eastern garbanzo bean dip with pita triangle, for example.) Dried
  beans, which are less expensive than the canned variety, must first
  be soaked for several hour and then cooked until fork-tender. Canned
  beans are already cooked and thus are more convenient but come packed
  in floured water that must be thoroughly rinsed off before you use
  them.

    Ingredients follow:
                      ***************
                      * INGREDIENTS *
                      ***************
    Think of your base as a blank canvas on which you are not about to
    create a gastronomical masterpiece.  The next step in its
    preparation is the preparation of the various ingredients that will
    give life to the dip.
    HERBS:
    The aroma of fresh herbs and the difference they can make in the
    appearance of your dip say much in their favor. With some herbs,
    such as Basil, using the fresh variety will actually tint the base
    of the dip.  It is recommended that you use fresh herbs when the
    primary ingredient is an herb.  Remember to finely chop all of the
    fresh herbs before adding them to the dip mixture.
    VEGETABLES:
    Always use fresh veggies in your dip unless the recipe specifies
    otherwise.  Most of the recipes call for raw vegetables, which add a
    lively crunch to the mixture.  In the few dips, where roasting or
    baking are a part of the preparation, just follow the step by step
    directions.
    SEAFOOD:
    The use of canned seafood in the dip recipes is recommended as it is
    more convenient and in the case of ingredients such as smoked
    oysters or sardines, this is the only form that they are readily
    available in.  Always be sure to rinse the seafood, (fresh or
    canned) thoroughly in a strainer under cold running water before
    adding to the dip.
    For the shrimp dips, buy the tiniest baby shrimp you can find. If
    you use the larger shrimp, dice them coarsely before combining with
    the other ingredients.
    When using Crabmeat, flake it with a fork after draining and pick
    out any filaments that may remain.
    Canned TUNA should be purchased packed in water so as not to add
    more oil to the dip.  With canned seafood that usually comes packed
    in oil, such as oysters and anchovies, thoroughly drain off the oil.
    Sardines and salmon, even out of the can may contain bits of skin
    and bone that must be carefully removed.
    For CAVIAR dips, buy the cheapest caviar available. This is not to
    deny the merits of fine caviar.  But the cheaper varieties hold
    their flavor and shape better when blended with the other
    ingredients.
                          *************
                          * EQUIPMENT *
                          *************
    Dips are not only fun, they're easy to make as well. In most cases,
    the only equipment you really need, other than a mixing bowl, a
    sturdy spoon, a chopping knife and a strainer when draining and
    rinsing are called for, is a strong arm!
    Nonetheless, the high-tech gadgetry in your kitchen will make life
    easier and faster--thus conserving the vital arm muscles for the
    vital part of dipping.
    A food processor is great.  by following the manufacturer's
    direction for your particular model, you can use your food processor
    for finely dicing solid dip ingredients or chopping fresh herbs,
    pureeing vegetables or beans, creaming cottage cheese or cream
    cheese, and, with the proper disc, shredding block cheese.
    A blender can also be used to puree beans, chop herbs, cream the
    cottage cheese and with the addition of a little liquid from the
    recipe, cream cheese.  An electric mixer can simplify the task of
    creaming cottage or cream cheeses.

   Chilling & Warming follows:
                     ************************
                     * CHILLING AND WARMING *
                     ************************
    May of the dips call for chilling, to allow the flavors to marry (if
    you try a mouthful right after mixing and then again after chilling,
    you will be surprised at the difference).  For the recipes, cover
    the dips tightly and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. The dips can
    also be made up to 24 hours in advance and refrigerated. Garnish
    the dips after chilling.
    When serving chilled dips, especially in the case of those with
    mayonnaise or sour cream bases, it is a good idea to place the dip
    bowl within a larger, shallower bowl filled with shaved ice. This
    will maintain the optimal temperature and keep the dip from either
    spoiling or separating.
    Hot dips should be prepared on the stove top or in the oven
    according to the directions.  For serving, transfer the dip to a
    chafing dish or fondue pot over a low warming flame. Be careful to
    use only heat-resistant utensils.
                          ****************
                          * PRESENTATION *
                          ****************
    The way in which you present your dips can make a highly personal
    statement, rather like putting your signature on a finished work of
    art.
    Dips are best served in glass or china bowls, which are free of the
    acidity found in metal bowls.  Lining dip bowls with lettuce leaves,
    radicchio or endive leave, adds a nice touch as do the colorful
    garnishes on top.  Where it is not suggested as a particular
    garnish, reserve a TBLS of one of the ingredients to place in a
    dollop in the center or sprinkle over the top. Depending on the
    ingredients in the dip, you can also sprinkle peels of carrot or
    apple, shredded cabbage, chopped parsley, lemon zest, or shredded
    cheese over your masterpiece.
    Dippers, especially vegetable dippers that lend themselves to
    fanciful arrangements are often placed in a star-burst pattern or
    scattered on a platter in clusters. In either case, intersperse
    dippers of varying colors and textures.
                          ***********
                          * STORING *
                          ***********
    Always store dips in the refrigerator.  Use only glass, china, or
    plastic containers, as the acidity in metal bowls can alter the
    color and taste of the dip.  Seal tightly (airtight containers are
    the best) to prevent the dip from absorbing other refrigerator
    smells or turning crusty on the top.  Stir before serving again.

  tradition. You will also find recipes for preparing a number of novel
  variations, including elephant garlic chips, butterflake biscuit
  chips, noodle chips, and potato skins. You may also want to try
  toasted bagel chips. Just cut a bagel into slices, as thin as
  possible, and toast them until golden brown.
   EASY-TO-MAKE HOMEMADE POTATO CHIPS: Scrub 6 to 7 medium potatoes
  (about 2 pounds) under cold running water and peel, if desired. Slice
  the potatoes as thinly as possible, (thin enough to see through). As
  you proceed, place the slices in a bowl of cold water to remove the
  starch. The water will turn white.  Drain and refill the bowl,
  repeating this until the water remains clear.  Drain and let the
  potatoes dry.
   Fill a heavy skillet or saucepan halfway with vegetable oil or melted
  vegetable shortening and cook over medium heat until the oil crackles.
  Place the potato slice into the hot oil, a few at a time being
  careful not to overcrowd the pan.  When the potatoes are brown on
  both sides, 4 to 6 minutes, remove from the pan and drain on paper
  towels. Sprinkle with salt, if desired.
   Makes about 180 chips, or enough for about 3 cups of dip.
                         ******************
                         * Tortilla Chips *
                         ****************** These dippers can be made
  from either flour or corn tortillas. Corn tortillas are the more
  familiar breed, from which the dippers served with salsa in Mexican
  restaurants are made. Cut them into either triangular chips or small
  strips. Fried flour tortillas will hold up better in the larger chip
  form, have a stronger, deep fried taste, more like a toastada.
   Cut the tortilla into thin strips (12 to 16 per tortilla) or into
  triangles (8 per tortilla).
   Fill a heavy skillet halfway with vegetable oil or melted vegetable
  shortening and cook over medium heat until the oil crackles. Put the
  tortilla strips or triangles into the hot oil a few at a time. Watch
  carefully, as they fry very quickly (about 30 seconds). When brown on
  both sides, remove from the pan and drain on paper towels.
   10 whole tortillas make enough chips for about 1 1/2 cups of dip.
   EDIBLE TORTILLA BASKETS: A tortilla basket will lend flair to your
  dip table and set off a Mexican dip nicely. Fill a heavy skillet
  halfway with vegetable oil or melted vegetable shortening and cook
  over medium heat until the oil crackles. Have read an empty 1-lb
  coffee can (washed, free of grounds and very thoroughly dried).
   Place the tortilla in the hot oil, being careful of spattering.
   Protecting your hand with an oven mitt, grasp the coffee can with
  tongs, position it over the center of the submerged tortilla, and
  lower onto the tortilla. Continue to hold down until the tortilla
  turns golden brown and begins to rise up around the coffee can,
  forming a tulip shape (about 2 to 3 minutes.  Put the hot coffee can
  aside and remove the tortilla basket from the oil and drain.  Cool to
  room temperature before using.

      1 x  DIPS Dictionary follows in t
      1 x  (This is Part 5 of 9)
 
  ELEPHANT GARLIC CHIPS: Peel 6 elephant garlic cloves and slice
  lengthwise as thinly as possible (about 12 slices per clove). Fill a
  heavy skillet halfway with vegetable oil or melted vegetable
  shortening and cook over medium heat until the oil crackles. Put the
  garlic slices into the hot oil, a few at a time, and watch closely.
  As soon as the other edges begin to turn brown (about 15 seconds),
  turn the chips over. Fry each chip until the other side turns brown,
  (not black--about 15 seconds). Be careful as the second side cooks
  very quickly. 6 Cloves make enough chips for about 1 cup of dip
  BUTTERFLAKE BISCUIT CHIPS: Prepare refrigerated butterflake biscuit
  mix according to the package directions and let the biscuits cool
  thoroughly. (Leftover butterflake biscuits can be used or biscuits
  can be made the night before and stored in a zip-lock bag). Separate
  the flaky layers of each biscuit and place on an ungreased cookie
  sheet. Bake at 250 degrees F. for 25 to 30 minutes or until crisp.
  let sit for about 45 minutes before serving. One package of biscuit
  mix makes 5 to 6 dozen chips, or enough for about 2 cups of dip.
  NOODLE CHIPS: Boil wide egg noodles in water according to the package
  directions. When cooked, strain immediately and run under cold water.
  Let noodles cool and dry on paper towels.  Cut each noodle into
  3-inch lengths. Fill a heavy skillet halfway with vegetable oil or
  melted vegetable shortening and cook over medium heat until the oil
  crackles.  Put the noodles in the hot oil a few at a time and fry
  until golden (about 1 minute). Remove from the pan and drain on paper
  towels. One 8-oz package of noodles makes about 120 chips, or enough
  for about 2 cups of dip. POTATO SKINS: Scrub 6 to 7 medium baking
  potatoes (about 2 pounds) under cold-running water and dry. Bake at
  400 degrees F. for 40 minutes. Remove and let cool.  Cut each potato
  in half lengthwise and scoop out the meat, leaving about a quarter
  inch of potato lining each skin.  Reserve the scooped out insides for
  making miniature potato pancakes (see the recipe in this file). Cut
  each hollowed-out potato skin into quarters (yielding 4 chips per
  skin, or 8 chips from each whole potato). Brush with melted butter on
  both sides. Bake at 425 degrees F. for 15 minutes or until crisp. 6
  potatoes make enough potato skins for about 2 cups of dip.
  ************ * CRACKERS * ************ While there are numerous
  advantages to homemade chips, crackers are another tory entirely.
  Crackers come packaged in just about any flavor, shape or size you'll
  ever want and the truth is that commercial preparation of crackers
  usually yields better results. But there are those of you that have
  shirtsleeves that just wont stay rolled down so here is a recipe for
  a tasty homemade onion cracker. ONION CRACKERS: 2 Cups Unbleached
  All-Purpose Flour
        1    Tsp  Baking Soda
      1/8    Tsp  Salt
        2    Tbl  Vegetable Shortening
      1/2    Cup  Minced Onion
    1 1/2    Tsp  Celery Seed 3/4 Tsp Crushed Red Pepper Flakes
      2/3    Cup  Water (Approximately) In a food processor fitted with
  a metal blade, combine the flour baking soda and salt, blending well.
  Add the shortening all at once and process until the mixture becomes
  coarse meal. Add the onion, celery seed, and red pepper flakes.
  Drizzle the water through the feed tube a little at a time, using
  only as much water as necessary for the batter to form a ball (the
  amount of water will vary with every batch). Divide the dough in half
  and on a well-floured board, roll out each half to 1/8-inch
  thickness.  Cut into squares or rectangles with a knife or pizza
  cutter. Place the crackers on a lightly greased cookie sheet,
  piercing each cracker 3 times with a fork. Repeat for the remaining
  half of the dough.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 to 25 minutes or
  until medium brown. Cool on a wire rack. Makes 50 to 60 crackers or
  enough for about 2 cups of dip.

                         * BREADS *
                         ********** To withstand the test of dipping,
  breads must be firm enough in texture to successfully transport the
  dip from the bowl to the mouth.
   Chunks of coarser breads, such as French, Italian, and some ryes work
  well, as do toasted or dried breads. Pita bread cut into triangles and
  toasted is a tasty and versatile dipper. The following recipes, Herbed
  Croutons and Bread Sticks, are good for dipping.
   HERBED CROUTONS: Using 4 cups of crustless bread that is fresh or
  one day old, cut into 2-inch squares or tear into chunks. (You can
  also use cornbread.)  Gently toss the bread chunks with 1 cup of
  melted butter or regular margarine which has been laced with the herb
  suggestions below. Place on a cookie sheet and toast in a 400 degree
  F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes if a soft center is desired or for 20 to
  25 minutes for crunchier croutons.
   Makes enough for about 2 1/2 cups of dip.
   HERB COMBINATIONS FOR THE ABOVE RECIPE: Variation 1: 2 Tbls Dried
  Tarragon
      1/2    Tsp       Onion Powder Variation 2: 2 Cloves Crushed
  Garlic (Use a
                                     Press)
      1/4    Tsp       Salt Variation 3: 1 Clove Crushed Garlic
        1    Tbls      Dried Basil
                                     Grated Parmesan Cheese
                                     for garnish. (Sprinkle
                                     over the croutons just
                                     before toasting.) Variation 4: 2
  Tbls Italian Seasoning Variation 5: 2 Tbls Minced Onion
      1/4    Tsp       Salt BREAD STICKS: Melt 1/4 cup of butter or
  regular margarine and mix with 1/4 tsp garlic powder. Prepare frozen
  soft bread sticks according to the directions on the package but
  brush with the garlic butter before baking.  When done, let cool for
  about 2 hours. Cut each bread stick into 4 equal pieces. Place on an
  ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 225 degrees F. for 30 minutes or
  until the bread sticks are dry and crisp.
   One package of frozen bread sticks makes enough for about 2 1/2 cups
  of dip.

   Vegetables follow:
                         **************
                         * VEGETABLES *
                         ************** The crudite craze of the 1970's
  awakened Americans to the hidden potential of vegetables. No longer
  overcooked, soggy, and tasteless, vegetables are now enjoyed
  raw--crisp flavorful, and in their most nutritious form--or lightly
  steamed, dipped in a variety of yummy accompaniments.
   Firm varieties, such as carrot sticks, celery stalks, or flowerets of
  cauliflower and broccoli, will stand up to even the densest of dips.
   Some of the smaller veggies, such as cherry tomatoes or Brussels
  sprouts may require utensils (such as toothpicks or mini skewers) to
  spear the dipper, lest you risk its lost at sea in the dip bowl.
   Always remember to wash the vegetables firs, dry them thoroughly and
  chill.  To chill, wrap the veggies in damp paper towels, place in an
  unsealed plastic bag and set in the refrigerator overnight.
   Following are the prepping instruction for some favorite veggie
  dippers.
   ASPARAGUS:  Break off the tough woody end at the base of each spear.
   ARTICHOKE:  Cut the stem flush with the base and clip the sharp
  point at the tip of each leaf with scissors. Steam for 45 minutes or
  until fork tender.  After cooling, cut in half vertically and remove
  the fuzzy choke ( a grapefruit spoon works best).  Serve halves cut
  side down so that the leaves can be pulled off easily.
   BOK CHOY:  Separate leaves, discarding any yellow or very dark green
  parts.
   BROCCOLI:  Cut off the stalk and remove the leaves. Cut into
  flowerets.
   BRUSSELS SPROUTS:  Remove the tough outer leaves and trim the
  bottoms, as you would for cooking.  Let soak a few minutes in cold
  water to crisp. Serve whole or halved, depending on size.
   CARROTS:  Peel or scrub (remember that the greatest vitamin content
  is in the skin), trim ends and cut in half horizontally then cut
  vertically into strips. Carrots can also be cut horizontally into
  circles or small chunks.
   CABBAGE:  Remove outer leaves and stalk then cut into strips thick
  enough to hold together, retaining a piece of the core with each
  wedge.
   CAULIFLOWER:  Remove the outer leaves and stalk and cut into
  flowerets.
   CELERY:  Trim off the leaves and cut into strips or wedges.
   CELERY ROOT:  Trim the top and cut the root, which is shaped
  something like a turnip, into strips or wedges, then peel.
   CHICORY OR BELGIAN ENDIVE:  Not to be confused with the curly or
  leafy green variety.  Has a slightly bitter flavor. Cut into thin
  strips or dipping size wedges.
   CHILI PEPPERS:  Including jalapeno peppers.  Cut in half lengthwise
  and carefully remove the seeds.  Rinse under cold water and cut into
  strips. Remember that this stuff has quite a kick--wear rubber gloves
  when prepping and be sure to forewarn your guests.
   CORN:  Serve individual ears of pickled baby corn. (It's ok to eat
  the cobs.) CUCUMBER: Trim ends and peel, if desired then cut in half
  horizontally.  Cut into thin strips.  Or cut the cucumber
  horizontally into rounds.
   FENNEL:  Trim off and discard the wispy fernlike leaves at the top
  and ends.  Cut into thin dipping size strips. Has a pleasant
  aniselike flavor.
   GREEN ONIONS OR SCALLIONS:  Peel off the outer layer and cut the tip
  off the root end.  Trim the green ends.
   JICAMA:  Remove ends, peel, and slice thinly.
   MUSHROOMS:  Trim off the stump end and wipe clean with a damp paper
  towel or a mushroom brush.  Do not soak in water. Use whole or halved
  depending on the size.
   PEPPERS:  Seed and slice green, red, yellow, or purple bell peppers
  into strips.  Can also be cut into wider scooplike wedges. The
  combination of two or three of the varieties makes an attractive mix.
   RADISHES:  Trim off the root and stem ends.  Sculpt to your heart's
  content if you're so inclined, after soaking the radishes in ice
  water to crisp for a couple of hours.
   SNOW PEAS:  Simply trim off both ends and remove the strings.
   SQUASH:  Yellow or green varieties of Zucchini.  Trim off top and
  bottom and cut into dipping size strips, circles, or wedges.
   STRING BEANS:  Use either green beans or wax beans, or both to add
  color. Snap off the ends of the beans and remove the strings.
   TOMATOES:  Use whole cherry tomatoes or wedges of plum or round
  tomatoes.
   TURNIPS:  Cut off the top and root ends of a young turnip, peel or
  scrub, and cut into thin slices (like a carrot).

  MINIATURE POTATO PANCAKES Rather at the opposite end of the spectrum
  from crisp raw vegetables lies another kind of dipper. One that at
  least began life in the vegetable kingdom ~-miniature potato
  pancakes. They're delicious and practical since they can be made
  weeks in advance and reheated. 2     Cups  Diced Raw Potato
        2    Large Eggs, Beaten
    1 1/2    Tsp   Salt
    1     ea    Black Pepper To Taste
        1    Tbls  Grated Yellow Onion
      1/4    Cup   Vegetable Oil Place the potato in a strainer and run
  under cold water to remove the starch. Shake well. Place in a food
  processor or blender and chop fine.  Add the eggs salt, pepper, and
  onion, blending well.  In a 10-inch skillet, heat vegetable oil until
  it crackles. Drop the batter by Tablespoonful into the hot oil and
  fry until golden brown (about 5 minutes per side).  Drain on paper
  towels. Once cooled, the pancakes may be frozen. Place in a
  freezer-safe container making sure that they don't overlap and put a
  double thickness of wax paper between each layer. Reheat on a cookie
  sheet at 350 degrees F. until hot and crisp. Makes about 50 pancakes
  or enough for about 2 cups of dip. ********* * FRUIT * *********
  Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of a small dip table, as they
  day, and man does not live by chips alone. To experience the full
  spectrum of dipping, one must savor the particular pleasure of
  cooping a mouthful of cheesecake dip on a slice of melon or plunging
  a strawberry into chocolate dipping sauce. As with veggies, you can
  let your imagination run amok, using the following suggestions merely
  as points of departure. Here too, always wash fruit carefully, dry,
  and chill. Use firm fruit. Some, as indicated below, should be dunked
  in an acid bat, which will keep the fruit from turning brown.  To
  make the acid bath, just add 2 tsps of lemon juice to 2 cups of
  water. After dunking fruit in the bath, drain on paper towels.
  APPLES:  Peel, if desired, core and cut into wedges. Requires the
  acid bath treatment. APRICOTS: Remove the pits and quarter. Requires
  the acid bath treatment. BANANAS: Use firm bananas, free of bruises.
  Just peel and cut on the diagonal into wedges.  Requires the acid
  bath treatment. COCONUTS: Remove the outer shell and reserve the milk
  for other uses, if desired, and cut the coconut meat into dipping
  strip sizes or chunks. Rinse with cold water. FIGS:  Remove the stem
  end and quarter. GRAPEFRUIT: Remove the peel, then break into
  segments. Carefully remove the seeds and white pith. GUAVA: Remove
  the skin.  Cut into wedges and carefully remove the seeds. KIWIS:
  Remove the skin from firm kiwis and quarter or cut into circles.
  MANGOES: Remove the skin.  Cut top half of the fruit away from the
  large oval pit. Turn over and cut away the balance of the fruit, and
  discard the pit. Cut the fruit into wedges across the grain. MELONS:
  Cantaloupe, crenshaw and casaba melons, like most fruit, complement
  sweeter dips, while honeydews are a good accompaniment to salter or
  spicier dips. In any case, cut off the outer skin, cut in half, scoop
  out the seeds, and cut the pulp into dipping size slices, chunks, or
  wedges. NECTARINES: Pit and quarter. Requires the acid bath
  treatment. ORANGES:  Peel and separate into individual segments.
  Carefully remove the seeds. PAPAYAS: Use ripe papayas. Remove the
  rind, cut in half and scoop out the seeds. Cut into thin strips.
  PEACHES:  Remove the pit and cut into wedges. Requires the acid bath
  treatment. PEARAPPLES: Remove the core and cut into slices or wedges.
  Requires the acid bath treatment. PEARS: Peel, if desired, core and
  cut into dipping size chunks. Requires the acid bath treatment.
  PINEAPPLES: Remove the outer skin, cut out the eyes and remove the
  center core, if desired.  Cut into chunks or spears. PLUMS: Cut in
  half, pit, and quarter firm plums. PRICKLY PEARS OR CACTUS PEARS:
  Using a fork to hold the fruit in place, remove the rind and cut into
  slices or wedges. STAR FRUIT OR CARAMBOLA:  White or sweet yellow
  varieties. Cut the fruit horizontally into stars. STRAWBERRIES:
  Serve whole. TANGERINES: Peel and separate into individual segments.
  Carefully remove the seeds. Dried fruits not to be overlooked include
  apples, apricots, banana chips, pitted dates, figs, pears, and
  pineapples.

  Seafood Follows: *********** * SEAFOOD * *********** The primary
  seafood dipper is shrimp, the hands down all-time favorite of most
  cocktail party aficionados. Salmon may be know for joining forces in
  their journey upstream but no one has truly witnessed a school of
  fish in action until they've seen a bevy of shrimp dippers converging
  with full force on the remoulade. You might want to peruse the
  following for more suggestions. SHRIMP:  Shell, score down the back
  (making an incision about 1/16-inch deep), and remove the thin black
  vein while holding under cold running water.  Bring a pot of water to
  a boil (about 2 quarts of water for a pound of large shrimp).  Add a
  little salt, throw in the shrimp, turn off the flame and let stand
  for about 5 minutes, or until the shrimp just curl and turn pink and
  translucent. DO NOT OVERCOOK!!! Then drain, run the shrimp under cold
  water and refrigerate. CRAB CLAWS: Stone crab claws are readily
  available already cooked. Just smash the shells with a nutcracker and
  place in a bowl over ice. CRAB LEGS: King crab legs and snow crab
  legs also are readily available already cooked. Break into lengths at
  the joints and crack the shells with a nutcracker.  Place in a bowl
  over ice. CRAYFISH: Follow the directions for preparing shrimp.
  LOBSTER: Use large lobster tails.  Bring a pot of water to a boil
  (about 2 quarts of water for a pound of lobster).  Plunge the tails
  into the boiling water and return to a boil. When the shell turns
  orange, lower to simmer and cook until the meat at the end of the
  tail turns translucent.  Remove and blanch under cold water. Split
  the soft underside of the shell with scissors, remove the meat and
  cut into chunks. SARIMI: Imitation crab. Sold cooked and chunked in
  most supermarkets. FRESH OYSTERS: Loosen the oyster from the bottom
  shell and serve on the half shell over a bed of ice (allowing the
  guest to scoop up the dip with oyster on the shell). SMOKED OYSTERS:
  Drain and serve each with a toothpick. ******************** * MEAT
  AND POULTRY * ******************** As long as you've eaten your
  vegetable dippers, you can proceed to the rest of the goodies on the
  dip table. Meat and poultry dippers will win the hearts and minds of
  those guests who anticipated leaving your part having had only a
  handful of potato chips to stave off starvation. CHICKEN BREASTS:
  Poach the breasts in wine and cube for serving.  Or marinate breasts
  in teriyaki sauce, bake and cube for serving. CHICKEN DRUMETTES:  The
  drumsticklike part of the wing. Marinate if desired and then fry.
  CHICKEN SATAY:  Skewer cooked, sliced chicken breast on a wooden
  stick for dipping. DELI MEAT: Cut rolls of cooked, sliced roast beef,
  ham, corned beef, or pastrami into 3 to 4-inch lengths. DUCK: Cut
  cooked or smoked breast into strips. HAM: Cut cooked, smoked,
  maple-cured ham into thin 3-inch strips or into 1-inch cubes. HOT
  DOGS: Serve miniature cooked hot dogs whole or cut cooked regular
  sized hot dogs into slices on the diagonal. PRECOOKED SAUSAGES: Use
  bologna, summer sausage, any variety of salami, or other cooked
  sausage cut into 1/2-inch lengths, then wedged. RAW SAUSAGES:  Try
  pork, beef, veal, duck, or Polish. Prick the skin, broil until brown,
  and cut into 2-inch lengths. STEAK: Marinate tenderloin or sirloin in
  teriyaki sauce, broil, and cube. TURKEY: Cut cooked or smoked breasts
  into strips or cubes. BEEF SATAY One of the more popular dippers to
  surface of late is beef satay, or beef on a stick. It easy to eat and
  filling, and meat as a dipper is still something of a novelty. 1 Ea
  Sirloin Tip Steak (1 lb or better)
      1/2    Cup Teriyaki Sauce 2 Tsp Finely Chopped Green Onion (White
        part only)
        Wooden Or Bamboo Skewers As Needed Thinly slice the steak.
  Slices should be about 1/2-inch shorter than the skewers on which
  they will be placed. Put the meat, sauce, and green onion in a
  zip-lock bag, blend well, squeeze out the excess air from the bag,
  and seal. Marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour or in the
  refrigerator for at lest 3 hours. (Steak can be marinated overnight
  for a stronger taste.) Soak the skewers in water for 10 minutes
  before using. Weave skewer in and out through the slice of beef,
  leaving a 1/2-inch "handle" at the bottom. Repeat until all the
  slices are skewered. Broil about 2

      Title: DIRT CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    Flower pot
      1    Garden trowel
      3    Gummy worms (or plastic)
      1    Plastic flowers, bunch
     16 oz Oreo cookies
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
      8 oz Cream cheese, softened
      1 c  Confectioner's sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 pk Inst choc-fudge pudding(4oz)
      3 c  Milk
     12 oz Whipped topping,1 tub thawed
 
  This is a joke, a bit of whimsy to lighten up your next party. The
  cake is really a quick mix dessert made with Oreo cookies and soft
  squishy stuff. The trick is to capture everyone's attention with an
  announcement of some sort, and as you are speaking, trowel out some
  of the dirt from the flower pot around the flowers and eat it. May be
  followed by a worm dug out of the "dirt". You may substitute vanilla
  pudding for the chocolate if you want, and use up to 20 oz of Oreos.
  Please use a clean new plastic flower pot or take the precaution of
  lining a clay pot with foil and wrap the stems of live flowers if you
  use them in order to prevent any toxins from entering the dessert.
    Crush the cookies until they resemble potting soil.
   Set aside.   Cream the butter or margarine, cream cheese, sugar and
  vanilla until smooth and fluffy.
   Set aside.  Combine the pudding mix and milk until well blended.
  Then fold in the whipped topping.
   Gently fold the cream cheese and pudding mixtures together. To put
  the "cake" together, layer one-third of the cookie crumbs followed by
  1/2 of the pudding mixture, 1/3 of the crumbs, the rest of the
  pudding mixture and topping with the balance of the crumbs.
  Refrigerate 10-12 hours before serving.
   Remove from refrigerator, decorate with flowers.
   Serve by digging out portions with the trowel.
   Serves 10 to 12.

      Title: DIRTY SNOWBALLS
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      2 c  Sugar, granulated
      4 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
      4    Eggs
      2 ts Vanilla
      2 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar, powdered
 
  Melt chocolate in double boiler or microwave.  Combine melted
  chocolate, granulated sugar, vanilla and vegetable oil in a mixer.
  
  Add eggs, one at a time, blending well each time. Sift (or stir)
  together flour and baking powder, add to wet mixture. Mix well.
  
  Let stand in refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Roll dough
  into small balls (no more than about 1 inch in diameter), and roll in
  powdered sugar until coated. Bake for 12 minutes in a preheated 350
  degree F. oven.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate cookies with powdered sugar coating -- This recipe was
  handed down to me from my step-sister who got it from her mother.
  Yield: Several dozen.
  
  *  The temperature is very important:  any lower and the cookies
  won't bake properly; any higher and the powdered sugar will glaze.
  
  *  If you coat your palms with powdered sugar before attempting to
  roll the balls your hands will get less sticky. Put the dough back in
  the refrigerator whenever you are not actively using it; it is easier
  to work when cold.
  
  *  You don't actually have to bake these; they make a reasonable
  fudge when left uncooked, but if left in the refrigerator for several
  days before baking they will become dried out. When done, the unused
  powdered sugar will have small shards of chocolate in it; these can
  be strained out and the sugar will be re-usable.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chilling,
       20    minutes baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 x  Sweetened Whipped Cream
    1/2 oz Semi-Sweet Chocolate
 
  CHOCOLATE PIE CRUST: Sift the salt and flour into a bowl and cut in
  the shortening, using a pastry blender, until coarse crumbs form. Add
  the chocolate and water, tossing with a fork, until the dough forms.
  Press the dough firmly into a ball and then roll out on a lightly
  floured surface into a 13-inch circle. Loosely fit the dough into a
  9-inch pie plate and trim the edge so that there it reaches 1 inch
  beyond the rim of the pie plate.  Fold the extra under the edge of
  the crust to from a ridge. Flute the edge and prick the entire
  surface of the pie shell with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12
  minutes or until a golden brown. Cool on a rack. CHOCOLATE PIE: Stir
  the 1/4 cup of sugar, the gelatin and salt together in a 2-quart
  saucepan.  Stir in the milk and slightly beaten egg yolks. Add 3 (1
  oz) squares of unsweetened chocolate and cook over low heat, stirring
  constantly, until the chocolate melts and the gelatin dissolves.
  Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Chill in the
  refrigerator, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is the
  consistency of unbeaten egg whites. Remove the chocolate mixture from
  the refrigerator and set aside Immediately beat the egg whites and
  cream of tartar, in another bowl, until foamy, using an electric
  mixer set on high speed. Gradually add the 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 Tbls
  at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until
  stiff, glossy peaks form when the beaters are slowly lifted. When the
  chocolate mixture mounds slightly when dropped from a spoon, beat
  until smooth, using an electric mixer at medium speed. Fold the egg
  white mixture into the chocolate mixture; then fold in the whipped
  cream. Chill in the refrigerator until the mixture mounds well when
  spooned. Turn into the chocolate pie shell.  Chill in the
  refrigerator for 2 hours or until set.  To serve, decorate the pie
  with puffs of sweetened whipped cream. Grate and sprinkle the
  chocolate over the whipped cream.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
      2 c  White or brown sugar*
      1 tb Vinegar*
      1 c  Broken nutmeats
      1 c  White raisins
 
  If you use the brown sugar and vinegar, you may prefer to call this
  Sea Foam. 1. Bring egg whites to room temperature. 2. Bring water and
  corn syrup to a boil in a heavy pan. Add white or
      brown sugar and vinegar, and stir until dissolved. 3. When
  boiling, cover pan and cook about 3 minutes until the steam has
      washed down any crystals that may have formed on the sides of the
  pan. 4.  Remove lid and cook over moderate heat, without stirring, to
  the hard
      ball stage, about 250F.  While syrup is cooking, beat egg whites
  in
      a large bowl until they just hold their shape. When the syrup is
      ready, pour it slowly over the egg whites in a steady thin stream,
      whipping slowly at the same time.  Toward the end, add the syrup
      more quickly and whip faster.  Do not scrape pan. 5. After all the
  syrup has been added, put in nutmeats and raisins. 6. Beat until
  candy can be dropped onto a buttered surface into patties
      which hold their shape. ~--

      blending well. 4. Pour the mixture into the pie shell and bake 10
  minutes.  Reduce
      the oven heat to 325 F and continue baking about 45 minutes. A
  little pecan lore from Craig Claiborne:
  
  "Pecans are, to my mind, the most Southern of nuts. One authority I
  know states that they were grown in Virginia long before George
  Washington was born and that the name derives from the American
  Indian word 'pakan'. The earliest colonists in Virginia and North
  Carolina transliterated the word as 'pagan' and as a result, the
  Pagan River, which flows through Smithfield, Virginia, was named for
  the abundance of pecan trees that grew along its shores and not for
  any pagans who lived nearby."

      Title: DIXIE'S FRIED CHICKEN
 Categories: Meats, Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Frying chicken, cut up
           Egg
           Flour
           Milk
 
  Wash and unless you are 19 and a beanpole with a family history of
  living to 108, skin chicken pieces. PLACE WASHED CHICKEN PIECES on
  CLEAN FRESH paper towel. Beat egg and milk together in bowl. Sift
  flour with the following spices to taste: salt or Lowry's seasoned
  salt, black pepper, Old Bay, curry powder (not much!), poultry
  seasoning, red pepper (not much!) mustard powder (not much!) other
  suitable spices to your taste. MSG may be purchased in ominous
  looking bag from Chinese restaurant supply if you really want to
  emulate the Colonel and really be a slacker, but Lowry's Seasoned
  salt has enough MSG to please most. Should you not prefer MSG, skip
  the Lowry's and use table salt. Note: Some people react to MSG so you
  can query your guests. The Colonel is loaded with MSG, that's what
  makes it taste so much like the Colonel. Deal with MSG according to
  your preferences. On with the show. In a preferably electric skillet
  at 350 (perfect!), or failing that, a non-stick skillet on Med. Hi,
  put on some Puritan oil. (Oil is less likely to splatter you and oil
  does not smoke.) Other oils are OK but Puritan is rated healthiest.
  About 1/4" deep. Allow to reach 350. NEVER place the washed and/or
  cooked chicken back in contact with any surface OR utensil (tongs,
  etc.) that has touched the pre-cooked chicken. There is a very
  prevalent problem with chicken just lately, but cooking takes care of
  it. Always, always, use a clean surface/utensil. Put flour mixture in
  bowl or pie tins, or a bag, depending on if you want to roll or
  shake. Roll or shake chicken pieces in flour mixture; then dip in
  milk mixture. Then roll or shake them in the flour mixture (2nd
  time.) Lower coated chicken pieces into 350 degree oil with tongs (DO
  NOT EVER PIERCE THE PIECES) and cook EIGHT MINUTES ON EACH SIDE.
  Covered skillet yields more tender crust. Uncovered yields crispier
  crust. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER poke the frying pieces with a
  fork, knife, etc. Use the 8 minutes on each side rule at 350 degrees.
  Poking releases juices that SPLATTER when they reach the hot oil.
  This burns you. Also, don't let any water or moisture drop into the
  oil. If this does not happen, it will not spatter you. If you need to
  check done-ness, you can remove the very thickest piece from the
  skillet onto a paper towel, and peek down to the bone and check for
  any pink. There should not be any pink. While frying, if the outside
  begins to darken too much before the inside is done, your heat is too
  high. If this happens and you turn it down, you can continue frying
  the pieces at an appropriate heat even with the outisde a little
  dark, and it won't really hurt anything. The inside will still be
  great! Gravy: When chicken is done, pour out all the oil except for
  about 1/8" or a little less depending on how many people want gravy.
  Mix a little bit (about 1/4 cup) of either regular flour or the kind
  in the small round box that PROMISES not to lump, especially for
  sauces and pastes and gravies, with COLD water to make a thin gruel
  in the measuring cup. COLD helps it mix and not lump (this works with
  cornstarch when making cobblers, pies, etc. too!) Mix the flour and
  cold water with fork. Now, assemble extra flour, the whole carton of
  milk, and water, and pepper and salt, in real real easy reach of the
  skillet. Turn up the heat in the skillet with your smaller amount of
  oil and drippin's, to about 425 or "Hi" for a minute. When it looks
  alive again, stir in your flour water mixture REAL FAST and keep
  stirring! It may start to look like it's going to lump but keep
  stirring fast! The object is to brown that flour and oil goop as much
  as you can before you add the milk. This is tricky and it never turns
  out right. When you give up on browning the flour/water/oil goop any
  more before it is cement, slowly begin to add milk and STIR FAST A
  LOT. It will thicken and you add more milk as it cooks. Oh, by the
  way, turn it back down to about 350 or Med. as it bubbles. When you
  have about half the volume of gravy you are going to need, switch to
  water instead of milk. You will not believe if you taste the yummy
  chicken, that more salt and pepper will be needed for this gravy, but
  if you taste it at this point you will see that the gravy is VERY
  bland. You will need to add a LOT of salt, pepper, seasoned salt,
  whatever is your taste. If your gravy does not go right and clumps up
  during the browning stage, you are in fine company. Just go ahead and
  add the milk, stir, and put the whole thing in the food processor;
  afterwards, you can return the mixture to the skillet and teach it
  who's boss. Just remember to season it enough. And serve on top of
  some ho-made mashed potatoes!!!!!! P.S. M.S.G. fans, Lowry's seasoned
  salt is EXCELLENT in mashed potatoes. Not gourmet. But very tasty and
  nobody has to know! Oh, OK, you may want to check with your guests
  before using anything with M.S.G. :-)

  Cook rice according to package directions.  Microwave is best. Takes
  about 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, in saucepan, combine cans of beans, 2
  cans water, Louisiana hot sauce (Red Devil is right kind but not
  Texas Pete or tabasco. Sauce is based on cayenne peppper.) Also
  onion, Creole and/or Cajun seasoning, avail. in spice or Cajun
  section of store; but LOOK OUT FOR THOSE THAT CONTAIN SALT if so,
  don't add too much and don't add extra salt. If Cajun seasoning
  contains salt, you can easily get too salty! Also may add cayenne
  pepper to taste; Black pepper.  Chop up sausage (any kind is OK as
  long as "Fully cooked"; hot is preferable to most who prefer a hot
  taste!) Taste as you go to make sure not too salty or too hot. Boil
  slowly for about 20 minutes, until it begins to thicken and smells
  REAL good. Serve beans in bowl OVER white rice.

      Title: DO-IT-YOURSELF "GOOFY PUTTY" BY STEVEN SPANGL
 Categories: Household
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
           Elmer's White Glue (Do NOT
           -substitute)
      1 tb Borax
           Food Coloring
      1 c  Water
           Empty plastic soda bottle
           -with cap
           Zipper-lock bag (quart size)
 
  Making The Borax Water:  Borax is a type of powder soap that is
  available in most grocery stores.  Add 1 tablespoon Borax powder to 1
  cup of Water. Stir until most of the powder dissolves. Store the
  Borax Water in a jar or bottle, and label the container "BORAX &
  WATER MIXTURE". Remember that one cup of Borax water will make many
  batches of "Goofy Putty".
  
  Preparing The Glue:  Measure 1 tablespoon of Elmer's Glue into a
  zipper-lock bag.  Add 1 teaspoon of plain water to the bag and mix.
  The additional water makes the glue flow better. Add a drop of food
  coloring to spice up the experiment.
  
  Making Goofy Putty:  Add 1 tablespoon of Borax Water to the bag of
  watered-down glue.  Seal the bag and squeeze for 2 minutes in order to
  thoroughly mix the liquids. Notice that the liquids are starting to
  form a putty-like substance.  Remove the putty from the bag and
  continue to squeeze.  Try to explain how and why the glue changed.
  
  How Does It Work:  The mixture of Elmer's Glue with Borax and water
  produces a putty-like material called a polymer. In simplest terms, a
  polymer is a long chain of molecules. As a model for these chains of
  molecules, picture in your mind strands of cooked spaghetti. If the
  polymer chains slide past each other easily, then the substance acts
  like a liquid because the molecules flow.  If the molecules hook
  together at a few places along the strand, then the substance behaves
  like a rubbery solid called an elastomer.  Borax is the chemical that
  is responsible for hooking the glue's molecules together to form the
  putty-like material.
  
  There are several different methods for making this putty-like
  material. Some recipes call for liquid starch instead of Borax Soap.
  Either way, when you make "Goofy Putty" you are learning about some
  of the fun an unusual properties of polymers.
  
  SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WITH CHEMICALS Although these substances are not
  considered hazardous, you should treat all chemicals with care and
  wash your hands after handling. Do not taste or eat any of the
  materials described in these activities. Do not pour any of these
  experiments down the sink.  Do not allow any GOOFY PUTTY to remain on
  clothing, upholstery, wood surfaces, or carpet. These substances may
  stain and damage the surface.  Clean up any spill immediately.

      Title: DO-IT-YOURSELF "SLIME" BY STEVEN SPANGLER
 Categories: Household
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 ts Guar Gum
      1 tb Borax
           Water
           Mixing bowl
           Food coloring
      2    Empty plastic soda bottles
           -to store the liquids
           Zipper lock bag
 
  Making The Borax Water:  Borax is a type of powder soap that is
  available in most grocery stores.  Add 1 tablespoon Borax powder to 1
  cup of water. Stir until most of the powder dissolves. Store the
  Borax Water in a jar or bottle, and label the container "BORAX &
  WATER MIXTURE". Remember that one cup of Borax Water will make many
  batches of "SLIME".
  
  Preparing The Guar Gum (available at health food stores): Measure 4
  cups (approximately 1 liter) of warm water into a large mixing bowl.
  Add 10 drops of food coloring - possibly green! SLOWLY (very slowly)
  stir in 2 teaspoons of guar gum.  This fine powder has a tendency to
  clump up if it is not stirred into the water slowly. After thoroughly
  mixing, pour the guar gum mixture into a soda bottle and label it
  appropriately.
  
  Making Slime:  Pour 1/2 cup of the guar gum mixture into a clean
  zipper-lock bag.  Add 1 teaspoon of the Borax Water mixture that you
  made previously.  Seal the bag and shake. Within seconds you'll have
  prepared your very own batch of SLIME!  This gooey mixture will
  retain its slimy properties for 1-2 days before finally turning into
  a watery mess. When the SLIME is no longer good, seal it in the
  zipper-lock bag and throw it away. Do not pour it down the drain.
  
  How Does It Work:  It's gooey, slippery, sticky, really slimy and
  kids love it!  Make up a batch of SLIME and you'll be the hit of any
  party.
  
  The mixture of guar gum with Borax and water produces a slime-like
  material called a polymer.  In simplest terms, a polymer is a long
  chain of molecules.  As a model for these chains of molecules,
  picture in your mind strands of cooked spaghetti.  If the polymer
  chains slide past each other easily, then the substance acts like a
  liquid because the molecules flow. If the molecules hook together at
  a few places along the strand, then the substance behaves like a
  rubbery solid called an elastomer. Borax is the chemical that is
  responsible for hooking the guar gum molecules together to form the
  SLIME.
  
  Guar gum is actually a vegetable gum commonly used as a thickening
  agent in various food products and cosmetics. Additional guar gum may
  be purchased at a health food store. The guar gum and water mixture
  may only last a few days.  You can prolong the shelf life of the
  mixture by keeping it in the refrigerator.
  
  SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WITH CHEMICALS: Although these substances are not
  considered hazardous, you should treat all chemicals with care and
  wash your hands after handling. Do not taste or eat any of the
  materials described in these activities. Do not pour any of these

      Title: DO-IT-YOURSELF SOUSED PEACH SOUP
 Categories: Fruits, Soups, Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Peaches; ripe freestone
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2    Lemon; juice only
      3    Or 4 gratings nutmeg
      4 c  Heavy cream or ice cream;
           -melted
           Liqueurs and brandies
           Cookies
 
  "An incredible dessert invitation to extend to special summer guests
  when fresh fruit is at its best and you're feeling a little
  extravagant. Who could resist the temptation to "mix your own" when
  it comes to fruit puree, heavy cream, and a choice of liqueurs or
  brandies?"
  
  To facilitate peeling, place the peaches (or use nectarines) in
  boiling water for 1 minute. Using a small, sharp knife slit the skin
  and remove. Then pit and quarter the fruit and place it in a small
  saucepan with water to cover, sugar, lemon juice, and nutmeg. Simmer
  until tender, depending on the ripeness of the fruit, about 10 to 15
  minutes. Cool. Puree or pass through a sieve and chill.
  
  Serve in chilled bowls or very large parfait glasses. Pass the
  pitcher of cream or melted ice cream, and cookies, and have on the
  table a selection of liqueurs and brandies, depending on your taste
  and pocketbook. I suggest any combination of the following:
  
  creme de banana, cherry brandy, Amaretto, curacao, bourbon, anisette,
  rum, sherry, coffee liqueur, Tuaca.
  
  Also experiment with the softened ice cream; it need not be vanilla,
  but should be delicate. The cookies could be any of your favorites,
  but simple rich ones like macaroons or butter cookies such as Snowy
  Cardamom Crisps are an unequalled match for this soup.

    1/4 c  Of water
      6 oz Sweet chocolate, grated
 
  To prepares the cake: Butter and flour baking sheets to accomodate six
  layers. Using a plate as a guide, mark an 8 inch circle on baking
  sheets for each layer. While you can rotate the baking sheets, they
  must be rebuttered and floured for each layer. Preheat the oven to
  375 degrees. Sift the flour with the salt and beat the eggs with the
  electric mixer and add the sugar gradually. Fold in the flour, taking
  care not to overmix. Divide the mixture into six portions and spread
  each portion on the marked circles. Bake for 6-8 minutes or until the
  eges are very lightly browned. Trim the edge of each circle with a
  knie and lift the cake onto a wire cooling rack. Put aside 1 circle
  on alightly oiled baking pan. This will be covered with caramel to
  make the top layer of the finished cake. To prepare the butter cream,
  put the sugar and water in a small heavy saucepan and cook until the
  mixture reaches 218 degrees on a candy thermometer. Add the syrup to
  the lightly beaten egg yolks and beat in the butter a little at a
  timeed cake layer. Cover the sides with butter cream. Press the
  grated chocolate against the sides of the cake. Deocrate the top of
  the caramelized layer with piped butter cream. Leave the cake to
  season for 6 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Dobos Torta -

    1/4 c  Crushed pineapple

           (NOT mayonnaise), or
           Aoli; (greek-style garlic/
           -egg/olive oil mayonnaise)
 
  Chop Spam (after pouring off the slime), onions, eggs and Habaneros
  in a blender, food processor, Spam, -uh I mean- Meat grinder. I
  recommend fine/puree or when Spam is unrecognizeable.
  
  Mix in the Pineapple (can use small chunks for crunchiness, or sweet
  pickle relish for those who don't care for pineapple).
  
  Add Salad Dressing until a smooth consistency is reached (aoli can be
  used for those who like a hint of garlic).
  
  Eat as dip, (serves more people), or as a center piece in a bed of
  lettuce (serves two Texans)* or perhaps serve with a Tuna Salad
  version and see which one receives the greater number of ..umm..
  remarks.
  
  Serves 6-8  (or two Texans*)
  
  Greetings, Chile-Craniates: Dan and Dave Anderson have met the minimum
  posting requirement threshold and thus, opened Spamdora's Box. I
  would not necessarily say that this pink palate plaster qualifies as
  "animals I have et", but rather the Trial by Torture for the
  Gastro-Intestinal Team Olympics. I received a few suggestions and
  recipe improvements after I posted this originally: Crazy Coyote
  recommended Champagne, (not from the Spam Can, but in a more romantic
  setting) and a shift to the green-side of the epicurian equation with
  the use of the pickle-relish in lieu of the Luau Pineapple approach.
  Luis "Burnin' Love" Ayala thought that with a few additional spices,
  that it would resemble Mexican Mortadela, and that I should "can it".
  I have to agree that anything would improve the ..er.. unique
  texture, and await further revisionary opinions from y'all. May the
  TCS, the reverends Cardinal Begg and holeyniss Rael, and untold
  lurkers of ChileMundo witness that: I hereby submit, for the Spirit
  Of the Season, and my remaining 0.39 penance points for mentioning
  the _S_ word without a proper Chile fix: (the above recipe).

  Place 2 oven racks in the upper & lower thirds of the oven. Preheat

  sugar & allow yeast to sit in a draft-free spot for 10-20 min.
  
   The mixture should be full of bubbles.  If not, the yeast is too old

  place all the dry ingredients & stir well to blend them. Add the

      Title: DOGGIE TREATS
 Categories: Misc, Appetizers
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Powdered milk
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Garlic powder
      2 ts Onion powder
      2 ts Brown sugar
      1 ts Granulated Bouillon (fish)
      6 tb Meat drippings
      1    Egg, beaten
    1/2 c  Ice water
 
  My dogs prefer fish flavored granulated bouillon, but you can use any
  flavor you wish.  Combine it and the rest of the dry ingredients. Cut
  in drippings until mixture resembles cornmeal. Mix in egg. Add just
  enough water to make mixture form a ball. Pat (or roll) dough to 1/2"
  thick and cut into desired shapes. Small dogs (like mine) like bite
  sized pieces like stars about the size of a quarter.  The general
  rule is, the bigger the dog, the bigger the "cookie". The "10
  servings" are for 6 inch bones. Place on a lightly greased cookie
  sheet. Bake at 25 to 30 minutes, until hard and dry.  Cool before
  serving.

      Title: DOLMADAKIA (STUFFED GRAPELEAVES WITH RICE)
 Categories: Appetizers, Ethnic, Vegetarian, Rice
      Yield: 75 Servings
 
     16 oz Grape leaves
    3/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
      3    Onions; more if desired
           (shredded or minced finely)
  1 3/4 c  Rice
      1    Lemon, juiced
           - or more, to taste
           Dill; very finely chopped
  1 3/4 c  -Hot water
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
 
  Sautee the onion with half the oil. Add the rice and let cook for a
  few minutes. Add the dill, the hot water and salt and pepper. Boil
  for about 5 minutes. Let it cool.
  
  Steam the grape leaves and rinse with plenty of water in a collander.
  
  Wrap the rice mixture with the grape leaves. This is the most
  difficult and time consuming part, although after you are through it
  a couple of times you enjoy it the most. It is better if two people
  work on it simultaneously, talking, joking etc. You want to make them
  small in size (about 1-2 inches.) Do not hesitate to cut big leaves
  in half. Discard the central stem of these leaves and if you can
  reduce (with a sharp knife) any other tough stems it would be good.
  You want to wrap the rice very tightly. You place the rice in one
  end, fold from the short end and the two sides and then roll while
  pushing the rice downwards to pack it really tight. You have to do it
  a couple of times to understand. If they are not tightly packed they
  will unroll later. Also be careful to wrap totally, do not leave any
  holes.
  
  You arrange the dolmadakia in a casserole, tightly. Make more than one
  layers. Add the lemon juice, the rest of the olive oil and 1 1/2 cups
  of hot water. Cover them with a plate or something to keep them in
  place. Let them simmer for 35 minutes.
  
  Serve then cold, with strained yogurt or taramosalata. Enjoy.

      Title: DOLMADES YIALANDZI (STUFFED GRAPEVINE LEAVES)
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetarian
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Olive oil
    1/2 sm Onion; chopped
      8    Scallions; chopped fine
      2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped
      1 c  Raw long-grain rice
      1 bn Fresh dill; chopped
    1/2 bn Fresh parsley; chopped
  1 1/2    Lemons (or more), juice only
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 c  Hot water
      1 lb Jar grapevine leaves
 
  Heat the 1/2 cup oil in a skillet.  Add the onion and scallions and
  saute for about 5 minutes, until soft and transparent. Add the garlic
  and cook for a few minutes, then add the rice, dill, parsley, lemon
  juice, salt, pepper, and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Stir well, then
  add the hot water. Cover and simmer about 5 minutes. Remove from the
  heat and cool. Meanwhile, carefully remove the grapevine leaves from
  the jar, leaving the brine in the jar.  Wash grapevine leaves
  thoroughly and drain, then with a sharp knife cut the heavy stems
  from the leaves. (If using fresh grapevine leaves use the same
  procedure, parboiling leaves for 5 minutes when not tender, then
  drain.) Line an enameled pan with a few heavy grapevine leaves and
  set aside.  To stuff a grapevine leaf, put it on your working surface
  rough side up and stem end near you, and place a teaspoonful of the
  rice mixture near the stem end. Using both hands, fold the part of
  the leaf near you up and over the filling.  Then fold the right side
  of the leaf over the filling, then the left side, and roll tightly
  and back away from you and toward the pointed end of leaf.  Place the
  "dolma", seam side down, in the prepared pan.   Continue stuffing
  grapevine leaves until the mixture has been used. (If any grapevine
  leaves remain, replace in the reserved brine for future use.)  Place
  an inverted plate on the dolmades, then add enough water to cover the
  dolmades (about 1 to 1-1/2 cups). Bring to a boil, then cover the
  pan, lower the heat, and simmer as slowly as possible for 1-1/4
  hours, then taste one to see if the rice is tender, and continue
  cooking slowly if necessary.  Cool, then chill.  Serve cold, as an
  appetizer or as an entree. Note: An important variation, particularly
  in Macedonia and Thrace: add a few tablespoons of raisins and pine
  nuts to the filling when adding the rice. Also, you may vary the size
  of dolmades as you wish by adding 1-1/2 teaspoons of the filling.
  However, be consistent to allow them to cook at the same rate. They
  may be stored in the refrigerator for a week or so.

  During cooking, add a little heated liquid as needed to keep dolmas
  moist.  Remove from the heat and cool in the pot.

     30    To 40 grape leaves *
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 md Onion; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Raw long-grain rice
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
      3 tb Tomato paste
           Juice of 1 lemon
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  ;boiling water
           Lemon wedges; for garnish
 
  *These leaves are packed in jars in brine.
  
  Rinse grape leaves in warm water and drain in a colander. In a medium
  saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over moderate heat. Add onion
  and saute until limp. Add rice and pine nuts and saute, stirring 3-4
  minutes.
  
  Add tomato paste, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt, and boiling water.
  Cover and cook over low heat for 15-20 minutes or until rice is
  tender and all liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let stand
  covered for one hour.
  
  Placing a grape leaf right side up in front of you, place a heaping
  teaspoon of filling in a horizontal line along the middle of the
  leaf. Roll stem end of leaf up over filling, then fold in sides, then
  fold over top. Squeeze the stuffed rolled grape leaf gently in your
  hand; this will help keep it closed.  Continue stuffing grape leaves
  until all the filling is used.
  
  Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a lage shallow pot or
  frying pan.  Place the stuffed grape leaves close together in a
  single layer in the pot. Pour over remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Place
  a large heavy plate or flat casserole cover over the grape leaves to
  keep them from unfolding while they cook. Cover the pot and cook over
  very low heat for one hour. Let cool with plate on top of them.
  Remove from pan and refrigerate. (These are best made a day or two or
  up to a week ahead.) Bring to room temperature before serving. Serve
  garnished with lemon wedges.

      Title: DOMATES YEMISTES ( STUFFED TOMATOES )
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12    Firm, ripe tomatoes
           Salt
           Granulated sugar
      3 tb Olive oil or butter
      1 md Onion; finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves; chopped
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/2 lb Lean lamb or veal, ground
    1/4 c  Dry white wine
    1/4 c  Water
      6 tb Raw long-grain white rice
           Tomato juice (if necessary)
           Freshly ground pepper
      2    Sprigs fresh mint or basil
      1 pn Grated nutmeg
 
  Wash the tomatoes, then turn each stem-side down, and with a sharp
  knife carefully cut the end now up to make an opening or "cap" being
  careful not to detach the cap entirely. With a small spoon,
  carefully, without breaking the outer skin of the tomatoes, scoop the
  pulp into a bowl. Place the tomato shells in a baking-serving dish
  large enough to support them touching.  Sprinkle the inside of the
  shells with salt and sugar. Meanwhile, prepare the stuffing.  Heat
  the oil in a heavy skillet and add the onions.  Cook over moderate
  heat until soft and transparent, then add the garlic and parsley, and
  blend. Add the meat, mashing with a fork, then add the wine and
  water, cover, and simmer for a few minutes. Add the rice and tomato
  pulp and stir. (Tomato juice may be added if necessary, since the
  mixture should provide enough liquid for the rice to absorb.) Cover
  the skillet and simmer about 7 minutes, then add salt, pepper, mint
  or basil, and nutmeg.  Taste for seasoning. Remove from heat, and
  fill the tomatoes up about two-thirds of the way with the stuffing
  and liquid. Cover with tomato caps, brush with oil. Bake in a
  moderate oven (350 F) until the rice is tender (approximately 50
  minutes to 1 hour), basting inside the tomatoes with liquid released
  by them. Serve warm. Note: For Tomatoes stuffed with Rice, use 1 1/4
  cups raw long-grain white rice instead of the meat and rice in the
  above recipe, eliminate the wine, and include with the other
  seasonings a few tablespoons each of black raisins and 2 tablespoons
  pine nuts, if desired.  Rice in baked stuffed dishes takes much
  longer to cook then over a burner. Stuffed green peppers, also
  popular in Greece, can be made the same way with an entirely
  different flavor.

           ;grain white rice

MMMMM----------------SILVER XPRESS MAIL SYSTEM 5---------------------
 
    In a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan, combine the tomatoes, 4
  tablespoons of butter, the salt and a few grindings of pepper.
  Stirring and mashing the tomatoes with a spoon, cook over moderate
  heat for 5 minutes until the mixture is thick and fairly smooth.  Add
  the stock and the tomato paste, bring to a boil and cook briskly for
  5 minutes. Puree the mixture through a fine sieve set over a bowl,
  pressing down hard on the tomatoes with the back of a spoon before
  discarding the seeds and coarse pulp.
    Measure the puree and return it to the saucepan. There should be 2
  cups. If there is more, boil it briskly over high heat until reduced
  to the required amount; if there is less, add more stock. Bring to a
  boil over high heat, then pour in the rice.  Stir once or twice,
  reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and simmer for about 20
  minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is
  tender but still slightly resistant to the bite.
    Add the 4 tablespoons of melted butter and toss the rice with a fork
  until the grains glisten.  Drape a towel over the rice and let it
  stand at room temperature for 20 minutes or so before serving.

           Dry husks from 4 tomatillos
           -(optional)
      2 lb Finely diced pork
      3    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 cn Enchilada sauce (Las Palmas
           -preferred) *
      2 ts Oregano
      1 ts To 2 ts toasted cumin seed,
           -crushed or ground
      2 tb Masa harina
    1/4 c  Water
    1/4 c  Minced cilantro
      1    Toasted japones chile,
           -ground (optional)
 
  * 1-pound, 12-ounces size
  
  To clean the cactus paddle, hold it gingerly between the nodes of the
  prickly spines. Use a sharp paring knife to slice off the nodes. Keep
  a damp paper towel nearby to wipe your knife on, making sure the
  spines stay on the towel. Trim around the edge of the paddle where
  the spines are closer together. It is not necessary to peel the
  cactus, only to remove the nodes and spines on both sides. Trim off
  the blunt end where the paddle was cut from the plant. Cut the paddle
  into 1/4-inch strips about 2 inches long.
  
  Bring 4 quarts water with 1 tablespoon salt, the onion, garlic,
  cilantro and tomatillo husks to a boil; drop in the cactus strips.
  (Tomatillo husks help retain the bright green color of the cactus.)
  Blanch the cactus until just crisp tender, about 8 to 10 minutes.
  Drain strips in a colander and rinse with cool water.
  
  Place the meat in a pot with 3 cups of water. Simmer, covered, until
  the water is just about gone
  
  Tilt the pot and drain off the fat.
  
  To the drained meat, add garlic, the red chile sauce and spices.
  Simmer about 30 minutes. Taste for salt, then stir in the drained
  nopalitos. Simmer for 20 minutes.
  
  Blend the masa harina and the water to make a paste; whisk it into
  the stew for a thickener. Simmer 5 minutes longer, then stir in the
  cilantro. If you like a spicy stew, add the japones chile. Serve in
  bowls accompanied by warm tortillas.

  recipe is so simple, I almost feel guilty serving it.
  
  *  Variations: Crush some walnuts into the crust. Pour a can of
  cherry or blueberry pie filling over the chilled cake, then chill
  again. Put about 2-3 T of your favorite liqueur into the cake filling.

      2 c  Lukewarm water or milk
      2 c  Bread or unbleached all
           -purpose flour
  2 1/2 ts Yeast
 
  Mix together in a GLASS or PLASTIC BOWL the above ingredients. Do not
  use metal utensils.  Cover the bowl with a tight fitting lid and
  allow to sit in a warm, draft-free location for 4 to 7 days, gently
  stirring once a day.
  
  You may use your starter after 4 days.
  
  To use your starter, simply remove the amount called for in the
  recipe and add to the other ingredients. Replace the amount removed
  with equal amounts of water/milk and bread/unbleached all purpose
  flour. I always used bread flour.
  
  After feeding your starter, leave on counter for 24 hours. At the end
  of that period you may refrigerate your starter. You must refeed at
  least once every 7 days, so I use my starter once a week. If you do
  not plan to use it, then take one cup out and throw away and feed.
  
  If you will be away on vacation you may freeze your starter, thaw it
  in the refrigerator upon your return. As soon as it is thawed, remove
  at least one cup and feed as above.
  
  I alternate feedings, one week with milk, the next with water.

      Title: DORO WAT (ETHIOPIAN STEW)
 Categories: Ethiopia, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    To 3 lbs chicken
      9 oz Tomato paste
      3    Sticks butter
     10    Hard boiled eggs slightly
           -scored
      3 lb Onion fine chopped
      2 lg Cloves garlic minced (or 2
           -tsp. powder)
      1 ts Ground black pepper
      3    Heaping tb berbere
 
  Snagged this from over on the Rime Cuisine echo.  I'm in the process
  of making it even as I type and it's *real* good so far. A sweet,
  rich, hot stew.  The sweetness comes from the huge amount of onions
  used. The richness from the butter (it definitely ain't health
  food!). The heat from the "berbere"++a seasoning mix of spices based
  on cayenne peppers. Made in the proportions below it's most
  definitely hot, but nothing someone who can handle jalapenos can't
  handle. The heat and spiciness could be handled by reducing the
  amount of berbere or even better making the berbere with a lesser
  amount of cayenne so you retain the other spices. The effect is kinda
  off in the general direction of a Mexican Mole. You mop it up with
  Injera, a flat bread++I'm using pita bread and flour tortillas
  instead. Not sure how acceptable that is, but I didn't feel like
  making Injera. Will post a recipe for Injera tomorrow.
  
  If you haven't tasted Ethiopian food, you'll be surprised at the
  unique flavor of Doro Wat.  Even if you have a chance to sample it at
  one of the growing numbers of Ethiopian restaurants in large cities.
  It's a dish worth trying at home.  To eat it the Ethiopian way, pass
  around a tray of injera (flat bread), and place a large platter of
  wat in the center of the table so everyone can reach it.  Tear off
  pieces of injera with your right hand. Fold the bread around bits of
  stew and eat, without touching you fingers to either the stew or your
  mouth (a trick that requires practice!).
  
  Remove skin from the chicken and score each piece slightly with a
  knife so the sauce can penetrate.
  
  In a large stew pot, melt the butter, then saute the onions and
  garlic for five minutes.  Add berbere, followed by tomato paste,
  stirring occasionally while the mixture simmers about 15 minutes. A
  piece at a time, stir in the chicken, coating well with the sauce.
  
  Continue to simmer, adding enough water to maintain the consistency
  of a thick soup.  When chicken is half done, after about 20 minutes,
  put in the hard boiled eggs. Cover and continue cooking until the
  chicken is tender.
  
  The dish is ready when the oil has risen to the top. Add black pepper
  and let sit until slightly cooled.
  
  Serve with injera.
  
  Makes 8 to 10 servings.

  put in the hard boiled eggs. Cover and continue cooking until the
  chicken is tender.
  
  The dish is ready when the oil has risen to the top. Add black pepper
  and let sit until slightly cooled.

      Title: DORO WOT (CHICKEN STEW)
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Whole chicken -- skinned and
           Cut up
      8 lb Onions -- chopped fine
      1 lb Garlic -- mashed
    1/4 lb Ginger -- mashed
      2    Ladles full
      1 lb Butter
           Salt -- to taste
           Pepper -- to taste
           Nutmeg or cumin -- optional
      1    Hard-boiled egg -- per
           Person
           Berbere *
 
  * Ethiopian chili powder (bere bere) Note: Mommy says nothing else
  will serve, although chili powder is the closest) ** (M. says
  Ethiopians like to see it swimming on top)
  
  This is an Ethiopian recipe for a very hot (key words here are hot,
  toasty, spicy) sort of stew-like stuff. I am posting it in reference
  to recent discussion on injira, the spongey millet bread upon which
  wot is eaten. This recipe comes via my Mom who obtained it directly
  from a foreign student who used to live with us, who is an awesome
  cook, BTW. This is a chicken version, it can be made with other meats.
  
  Cook onion over low heat, not in any fat, for a long time, stirring
  constantly over very low heat until all the water is evaporated.
  Continue stirring until onions are slightly brown. THEN add the
  butter; cook about 15-20 minutes still over low heat.
  
  Add 1 tbsp hot water from time to time (texture should be kind of
  pasty).
  
  Add bere bere. If it looks too dry, add hot water and stir. Cook it
  about 30-45 minutes - keep stirring frequently. Keep adding hot water
  if necessary.
  
  Be careful not to let it brown, because chili powder will become
  bitter. Add garlic and ginger and simmer 15 more minutes. Add water
  as needed.
  
  Meanwhile, with your other set of free hands, wash chicken pieces
  well, and let stand in salted in lemoned water. Then squeeze each
  piece really hard to get out as much water as possible. Then, make
  little slits in the meat so the sauce will penetrate.
  
  Cook the meat in the sauce until meat is tender, about 30 minutes.
  Stir from time to time. All this has been uncovered, by the way. Add
  spices to taste just before removing from stove. Add 1 hard-boiled
  egg per person, which have been slit (the eggs, not the people), and
  cook just long enough to heat through.
  
  Serve with lots of bread (injera).
  
  Freezes well.

      1 tb Chicken soup base
    1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
 
  Soak beans overnight in soda water. Combine all ingredients in Slow
  cooker. Cook on low 8 hours or until beans are tender. Note: Use 4
  cups water for Lima beans.
        Use 2 T dried vegetables in place of 1 c fresh.
        I use 1 T dried carrot tops in place of sliced fresh carrots.
  Created by Dorothy Flatman
    Revised to add soup bases and red pepper flakes 02/11/96 A revised
  recipe for my crockpot beans and ham. I used home grown horticulture
  beans, added beef and chicken soup base, and red pepper flakes to
  spice them up a bit. Got such raves from the family I decided I
  better revise the recipe while I still remembered what changes I made
  to it. Also decided to try soaking the beans overnight in baking soda
  water in an attempt to avoid the usual gassiness. Seems to have
  worked quite well, the beans were quite tender without being mushy.

  =========================== > Directions < =========================
  
  Cook the pasta according to package directions.
  
  In a large skillet or sauce pan: Heat the Olive Oil and the Sherry
  Pepper Oil. Add and Saute the Oregano, Onions and Shallots until
  almost translucent before adding the garlic and walnuts. Add the
  walnuts and garlic. Saute, without letting the garlic brown. Add the
  crushed Tomatoes and Burgundy wine and Basil. Cook slowly over a low
  heat, uncovered.
  
  In a microwave oven: Cover and cook the julienned Red Pepper for 1
  minute. Set aside. Cover and cook the julienned Zucchini for 2 to 3
  minutes. Set aside. The Red Peppers and Zucchini will maintain their
  pretty coloring by cooking "al dente" in the microwave.
  
  When the tomato sauce has been reduced and is the consistency
  desired, add the Red Peppers and Zucchini.
  
  Heat the Broiler.
  
  Drain the cooked pasta.  (Because water can cling to the insides of
  these little "macaroni pipes", I give the pasta a few spins in my
  Lettuce Spinner.)  Add the pasta to the tomato sauce and toss.
  
  Taste the sauce, adding salt and Crushed Red Pepper Flakes as desired.
  
  Transfer the Pasta and Sauce to a oven proof serving dish. Liberally,
  sprinkle shredded Mozzarella Cheese on top of the Pasta mixture. Place
  under the broiler until the cheese melts. Remove from the oven and
  garnish with the Basil florets and leaves.

 Categories: Quick, Apples, Breads
      Yield: 1 9x5 loaf
 
      1 c  Walnuts
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 c  Plus 2 T light brown sugar
      2    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 c  Applesauce, unsweetened
  1 2/3 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
           - preferably stoneground
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
      1 lg Tart apple*, pared, cored,
           - quartered and chopped
    1/2 c  Raisins, plumped if dry**
 
  * Granny Smith or Greening ** to plump raisins: place them in a small
  saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat.
  Drain thoroughly.
  
  Preparation: Preheat oven to 350F.  In the preheating oven, toast the
  walnuts in a single layer in a roasting pan or jelly roll pan.
  Coarsely chop and set aside to cool. Butter a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan and
  set aside.
  
  In a large bowl using an electric mixer at high speed, cream butter
  until light. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until
  mixture is very light and fluffy. Change the mixer speed to medium.
  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating with each addition, then beat in
  the vanilla and the applesauce.  (The mixture will look hopelessly
  curdled. Do not worry!)
  
  Change the mixer speed ot low.  Sift in the flours, baking soda, salt,
  cinnamon, and nutmeg and beat just until combined. Stir in chopped
  apple, raisins and walnuts.
  
  Spread the batter in the prepared pan with a spatula, smoothing the
  top.
  
  Bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 90
  minutes, loosly covering the top of the loaf with aluminum foil after
  50 minutes or so if the loaf seems to darkening too quickly. Let the
  loaf stan in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes before unmolding.
  Cool completely before wrapping or serving.

  Bake at 350 F (or 180 C) for 30 minutes 'til brownies begin to pull
  away from pan. Note: I usually do it opposite so that I can use one
  bowl, and they're just as yummy. My family hates walnuts, so I never
  get to taste them in these, though I bet they would be *wonderful*
  (poor Mom ~- she's always sacrificing -- can't you just hear those

      2 ts Instant espresso powder
      1 pn Salt
 
  Angel cake is not only no-cholesterol and no-fat but absolutely
  delicious with a light, puffy texture. Here, the cappuccino flavor is
  so deep that it's hard to believe that it lacks any fat at all.
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F with rack in center of oven. Have an ungreased
  10-inch tube pan ready. Divide sugar in half. Sift 1/2 3 times. Set
  aside. Sift other half with flour, cocoa and espresso powder 3 times.
  Set aside. Put egg whites in 4-quart grease-free bowl. Beat on low
  speed with mixer until frothy. Add cream of tartar and salt. Increase
  speed to medium. Beat until whites are whipped and hold their shape
  but are still soft and moist. Add 3/4 cup sifted sugar, 1 tablespoon
  at a time, beating well after each addition, until all sugar is
  added. Add vanilla. Stop beating when whites have increased in volume
  about fivefold, hold their shape and are shiny and smooth. Gently but
  thoroughly fold in flour mixture, by thirds. Transfer to baking pan.
  Smooth surface with spatula. Cut through batter in 6 places to break
  any large air pockets. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes
  out clean, about 35-to-40 minutes, laying piece of foil lightly over
  top if it gets too brown. Invert and rest tube on inverted custard
  cup. Prop pan extensions with crumpled foil to secure pan. Cool
  completely. When cake is completely cool, use flexible knife to
  loosen it from sides of pan. Invert onto rack. Keep cake at room
  temperature 2 days, well covered, or frozen (airtight) as long as 3
  months. Be sure to thaw at room temperature in wrapping. Frost.
  CAPPUCCINO FLUFF FROSTING: Put egg whites, sugar and corn syrup in
  top of double boiler. Place over simmering water. Immediately use
  mixer at medium speed to beat ingredients until fluffy, white and
  warmed through, about 5 minutes. Stir in marshmallows. Once combined,
  beat at lowest speed until marshmallows are melted and mixture is
  smooth. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla, cocoa, espresso and salt.
  Spread on top and sides of cake. Yield: frosting for 1 10-inch tube
  cake.

  stir back into pan. Remove from heat.
  
  Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.  Set dish in a larger rimmed
  pan, pour 1 inch boiling water into outer pan. Bake in a 350F oven

  flan and dish. Invert platter over flan; holding together, invert.
  Lift off pan. Cut into wedges.

      Title: DOUBLE CHICKEN BROTH STOCK BY JAMES BEARD~ CH
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 2 Quarts
 
MMMMM----------------INGREDIENTS PREVIOUSLY MADE---------------------
  2 1/2 qt Chicken Stock;
           -(See other recipe)
 
  Put the previously prepared, cold, fat-free, 2-1/2 quarts of chicken
  stock in an 8 quart pan. Add a whole stewing fowl or roasting chicken
  weighing between 4 and 5 pounds. Bring slowly to a boil. Skim off any
  scum that forms on the surface; reduce heat; cover and simmer gently
  until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour for a young chicken,
  or 2 to 2-1/2 hours for a fowl. Remove the chicken/fowl and either
  serve it as poached chicken, or remove the skin, take the meat from
  the bones, and use it for other dishes such as chicken salad, hash,
  chicken pie, or creamed chicken, etc. Strain the broth through
  several thicknesses of cheesecloth into a bowl; let cool, then skim
  off the fat. You now have 2 quarts of beautifully rich, strong broth
  which can be used for cooking. Should you want to reduce it even
  more, and clarify it for consomme' ... see the recipe: Chicken
  Consomme' by James Beard. For chicken consomme' the broth must be
  absolutely fat-free and clear. Therefore, it's important that you
  strain the above through several thicknesses of cheesecloth, let
  cool, and skim off all the fat.

  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate pie -- I got this recipe from a 1983 calendar.
  It's tried and true and delicious. It's also very simple to make. I
  usually double the recipe, since one pie never seems to last long
  enough. Maybe that makes it a double double chocolate pie. I've made
  it using chocolate almond liqueur instead of creme de cacao. It came
  out OK, and had a hint of a nutty flavor in the background.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  holes in cake and cool. Cover with whipped cream, drizzle chocolate
  over top. (I used whipped topping, because I wasn't sure how well
  whipped cream froze. I covered it and froze - it was great. I just
  cut slices as I needed them and left it in the freezer.)

MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      1 c  Heavy cream
 10 1/2 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
           - chopped in small pieces
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           - chopped in small pieces

      4 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
      5 tb Butter; softened
      2 tb Bourbon
      2    Eggs; separated
  1 1/2 tb Sugar

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      5 oz White chocolate
           - chopped in small pieces
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  Serves: 8-12 Preheat oven to 350 F. TO PREPARE CAKE: cut a round of
  wax paper or parchment to fit the bottom of a 9-inch round cake pan.
  Butter the pan, fit in the paper, and then butter it.  Coat the pan
  with flour, tapping out the excess. Bring the cream to a boil in a
  heavy 3-quart saucepan.  Remove it from the heat and stir in both
  chocolates. Cover the pan and let it stand for 5 minutes.  Stir the
  mixture until it is smooth. Set aside, uncovered. Combine the eggs,
  sugar and vanilla in a large bowl. Set the bowl over simmering water
  and whisk the mixture constantly until it is hot, about 2 minutes.
  Remove the bowl from the heat and beat with an electric mixer on
  moderate, then high speed until the mixture has tripled in volume,
  cooled, and it is as thick as a soft meringue, about 8 minutes. With
  a whisk, stir one-third of the egg mixture into the chocolate. Gently
  fold in the remainder with a rubber spatula, blending until only a
  few chocolate streaks remain. Pour the batter into the cake pan and
  smooth the top.  Place it in a larger pan and carefully pour in
  boiling water to reach halfway up the sides. Bake in the center of
  the oven for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center
  comes out clean. Let the cake cool for 30 minutes in the water, then
  remove it and place on a rack to cool completely. When it is
  completely cooled, run a knife around the edge of the pan and invert
  onto a serving dish. Gently remove the paper. TO PREPARE THE
  FROSTING: combine the chocolate and butter in the upper part of a
  large double boiler.  Set over simmering water and stir occasionally
  until they are melted.  Remove the pan from the heat and let the
  mixture cool for 10 minutes.  Add the bourbon and stir; whisk in the
  egg yolks, one at a time. Beat the egg whites to form soft peaks.
  Gradually add the sugar, beating until stiff peaks form, about 2
  minutes. Fold one-quarter of the mixture into the chocolate and blend
  well.  Fold in the remaining whites with a rubber spatula, blending
  until the whites are barely incorporated. Chill for at least 2 hours.
  TO PREPARE THE SAUCE: place the white chocolate in the top part of a
  double boiler over simmering water. Stir until it is melted.  Add the
  cream and stir for a minute. Cool to room temperature. (The sauce can
  be chilled, then warmed slightly to blend it, then cooled to room
  temperature for serving.) TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: scoop the frosting
  gently into a pastry tube fitted with a fairly wide (Number 4) star
  tube. Pipe the mixture over the top of the cake. You can chill the
  cake for as long as 2 days. TO SERVE THE CAKE: let it reach room
  temperature, which will take about 3 hours.  Stir the sauce, then
  pour a small pool onto each serving plate. Place a slice of cake on
  the sauce.

      2 c  Heavy cream
      1 c  Half-and-half
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      5    Egg yolks
 
  EQUIPMENT: 2 baking sheets with sides, 2 large 100%-cotton towels,

  2-quart plastic containers with lids, double boiler, electric mixer
  fitted with a paddle, rubber spatula, 2 stainless steel bowls (1
  large), instant-read test thermometer, ice-cream freezer
  
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast and skin the hazelnuts, then
  allow the nuts to cool to room temperature. In the bowl of a food
  processor fitted with a metal blade, chop the hazelnuts into pieces
  1/8 inch in size. Spread the chopped hazelnuts onto a baking sheet
  with sides.
  
  Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt
  saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist
  sand). Caramelize the sugar for 4 1/2 to 5 minutes over medium-high
  heat, stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the
  sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it
  caramelizes). Pour the caramelized sugar over the chopped hazelnuts.
  Stir the mixture with a spoon, then spread it into an uneven mass,
  about 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Allow the pralines to cool to room
  temperature. Break the pralines into uneven pieces, then place in the
  bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Chop the pralines

  unsweetened chocolates, coffee, and instant espresso powder in the
  top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with film wrap.
  Heat for 6 to 8 >>> minutes, then remove from the heat and stir until

  NOTES:
  
  *  Double stout beer -- I would not recommend making this as your
  first beer, but if you are into brewing and like a strong stout, then
  give this one a try. Don't be in a hurry to drink it, though, it
  really benefits from a long aging. I got the original recipe from
  Peter Lester in rec.food.drink, and formatted it for my local
  brewfriends. Then I thought that the net at large might enjoy it,
  too, so here it is with some additional notes from my experience at
  making it. Yield: Makes about 2 cases.
  
  *  Lester's initial specific gravity was 1.086 and his final specific
  gravity was 1.020 (alcohol about 8 percent). His fermentation time
  was 11 days (a slow batch).
  
  My batch fermented in about a week (house temperature ranging between
  60 and 68). It was barely drinkable after 6 weeks, but delicious
  after 3 months.  As far as I can tell, it's still getting better (a
  year later), so try not to drink it all up right away.
  
  *  Ingredient note:  I didn't know what a licorice stick was, until I
  asked the clerk at my brewstore. The one he gave me was about 1/3
  inch in diameter and about 3 inches long. It was dark black, and not
  sweet to the taste at all. It seems to be a standard brewing
  ingredient. Sorry I can't be more specific about it.
  
  : Difficulty:  For experienced beer brewers only.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 2 weeks fermenting, 6 months aging.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: DOUBLE-CHOCOLATE RUM CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 pk Chocolate cakemix (18 1/2oz)
      1 pk Instant chocolate pudding
      4    Eggs
      1 c  Dark rum
    3/4 c  Water plus 1 teaspoon
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      1 pk Chocolate chips
      1    Jar Raspberry prserves 10 o
      2 tb Shortening
      1 oz Vanilla baking bar
 
  My Grandmother's recipe calls for greasing a 10 in tube pan. I use a
  12-cup bundt pan with excellent results. 1.Combine cake mix, pudding
  mix, eggs, 1/2 c of the rum, 3/4 c of the water and the oil in a
  large mixing bowl. Beat at low speed until ingrediants are moistened.
  Then two minutes at medium speed. Stir in 1 cup of the chocolate
  chips. Pout batter into prepared pan. Bake 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in
  pan 15 minutes. Remove from pan, finish cooling on a wire rack. 2.In
  a small saucepan, heat preserves and remaining 1/2 c rum to make
  glaze. Strain through sieve to remove seeds. Place cake on serving
  plate. Prick the surface of the cake with a fork, or a tooth pick. (I
  use this time to vent frustations) Brush the raspberry glaze evenly
  over the cake. Use all the glaze. It does take a few minutes to do
  this. Just make sure its evenly applied. 3.In a bowl, combine
  remaining 1 c of chocolate chips and shortening. Microwave on high 1
  minute. (I know, my Grandma never had a Microwave, I just updated the
  recipe, because in this case the technology makes this process
  painless and quick, and I'm less likely to burn the chocolate.) Stir
  to make a smooth icing. Drizzle chocolate icing over the cake. Let
  stand about 15 minutes. 4.In a small bowl, combine vanilla baking bar
  and remaining 1 teaspoon of water. Microwave on high 30 seconds (or
  until melted). Drizzle vanilla icing over the chocolate icing.
  Grandma always served this tasty morsel with very strong coffee.

      Title: DOUBLE-CRUSTED PIZZA FROM SOUTHERN ITALY (EW)
 Categories: Main dish, Pizzas
      Yield: 1 Pizza
 
      3 lb Mixed greens, such as
           -spinach, Swiss chard,
           -escarole and/or broccoli
           -rabe
    1/4 c  Golden raisins
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 lb Onions (3 medium), peeled,
           -halved and sliced
      2    Cloves garlic, crushed
           -with flat blade of knife
     24    Black olives, pitted &
           -coarsly chopped
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
      6    Anchovy fillets, rinsed &
           -coarsley chopped
  1 1/2 lb Pizza Dough
      1    Egg, beaten with water
 
  Note - This double-crusted pizza used to be a Christmas Eve tradition
  in Napoli, but it is now found all over the south. Try for a good
  balance of bitter and sweet greens.
  
  Set rack on lowest level of oven; preheat to 375 F. Lightly oil a 10
  inch springform pan or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Dust with
  flour and shake out excess.
  
  Rinse out greens, trim away tough stem ends and slice tender stems and
  leaves into 1 inch lengths.  In a small bowl, soak raisins in warm
  water for 10 minutes, then drain.
  
  Meanwhile, in a pan large enough to hold all the greens, heat olive
  oil over medium heat.  Add onions and garlic; cook, stirring often,
  until light golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the greens, cover and
  cook until wilted, 5 to 7 minutes.  If necessary, add a little water
  from time to tome to keep the greens from scorching. Stir in olives,
  pine nuts, anchovies and the plumped raisins.  Cook over medium-low
  heat or 2 to 3 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper and let
  cool completely.
  
  Divide dough into 2 pieces, one a bit larger than the other. On a
  lightly floured surface, roll out the larger of the two pieces into a
  circle that is 14 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Place in the
  prepared springform pan, allowing a little dough to hang over the
  edge. Fill the pie with the vegetable mixture. Roll out the second
  piece of dough into a 10 inch diameter circle.  Place it over the
  filling, fold in edges of the bottom crust and pinch the crust
  together. Brush the top with a little of the beaten egg mixture and
  poke holes in it to let the steam escape during baking.
  
  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Remove from the
  oven and let sit for 15 minutes before serving. Serves 6

      Title: DOUBLE-FROSTED BROWNIES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Dozen
 
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
      2 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
           -(2 squares)
    1/4 lb Butter
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Nuts, chopped
           -(walnuts are traditional)

MMMMM-----------------------FIRST FROSTING----------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Half-and-half (also
           -called light cream)
      1 ts Vanilla extract

MMMMM----------------------SECOND FROSTING---------------------------
      3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
           -(3 squares)
 
  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Melt about 2 oz of chocolate and the
  butter in a heavy saucepan, then let it cool. Be careful not to let
  the chocolate burn.
  
  Beat the eggs in a large bowl until they are blended. Add about 1 cup
  200 g of sugar and mix well. Stir in chocolate-and-butter mixture.
  Mix until the chocolate is fully incorporated, with no streakiness.
  Add the vanilla, flour, salt and nuts. Stir just until the flour is
  incorporated; over-stirring will make a tough brownie.
  
  Spread the mixture in a greased pan, about 11 x 7 inches, that is
  about 1 1/2 inches deep. Bake in pre-heated oven for 20 to 25
  minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack. While it is cooling, follow these
  instructions to make the first frosting:
  
  Mix about 1 1/2 cups sugar, about 1/3 cup butter and about 1/2 cup of
  half-and-half in a heavy, medium-size saucepan. Bring to a boil, then
  cook over moderate heat without stirring until a small amount of the
  mixture forms a soft ball when dropped in ice water, or it reaches
  236 degrees F. on a candy thermometer.
  
  Remove from heat immediately and cool in a pan of ice-water until the
  candy is lukewarm. DANGER: melted sugar cools very slowly. You can
  burn yourself badly by testing it with your finger.
  
  Add about 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the candy. Beat it until it is
  creamy and of a spreading consistency. This is most easily done with
  an electric mixer, although you can use a heavy wire whip. Spread the
  frosting over the brownies.
  
  Melt the remaining 3 oz chocolate and spread over the frosting just
  put on the brownies. Cover as evenly as possible. Cool for several
  hours in a refrigerator, then bring to room temperature and cut into
  pieces to serve.
  
  Be very careful when melting chocolate.  It burns easily. A double
  boiler is probably the best way thing to use.
  
  It is critical to cook the first frosting to just the right point. If
  cooked too little, it will be too thin to beat to a creamy
  consistency. If cooked too much, it will be too brittle. So keep a
  close eye on it; sugar tends to cook slowly to the soft-ball stage,
  then it cooks quickly.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very rich brownies with double frosting -- This recipe is for
  people who like intense chocolate flavor. The result is a brownie
  with a fondant frosting, covered with unsweetened chocolate.  They
  are very rich, with an interesting combination of textures. This
  recipe is not for beginners.
  
  : Difficulty:  difficult.
  : Time:  a few hours preparation, several hours chilling and then
  warming : Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

      Title: DOUBLECRUST APPLE PIE
 Categories: 
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Sour Cream Dough for a
      2    Crust pie -- above
           Filling:
      3 lb Firm -- tart apples, such
           As Granny Smith, Pippin, or
           Golden
           Delicious
      3 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Lemon juice
    2/3 c  Sugar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
           Egg wash: 1 egg well beaten
           With a pinch
           Salt
      1 ts Sugar for finishing the top
           The pie -- optional
 
  Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 5 or 6 wedges.
  Melt the butter in a wide, shallow, slopingsided pan over medium
  heat. When the butter begins to sizzle, add the sliced apples and
  cook, tossing or gently stirring, until they begin to sizzle about a
  minute. Add the lemon juice and sugar and continue to toss or gently
  stir often until the apples are tender, but still fairly firm about 5
  minutes longer. If the appleshave exuded a large quantity of juice,
  they will reabsorb it as they cool. Pour the filling out into a
  nonreactive pan, or a pan lined with plastic wrap, on which the apple
  slices will fit in a single layer. Sprinkle with the cinnamon and let
  cool. Set a rack at the upper and lower thirds of the oven and
  preheat to 400 degrees. Roll out the bottom crust and arrange in pan.
  Pour the cooled filling into the bottom crust. Roll out the top crust
  for double crust pie. Cut several slashes in the top crust and
  carefully brush with egg wash. Be careful not to leave puddles of
  liquid on the crust. If you wish, sprinkle the top crust with sugar.
  Place the pie in the oven on the lower rack and lower the temperature
  to 375 degrees. Bake the pie for about 40 minutes, until the crust is
  baked through and a deep golden brown and the filling is gently
  bubbling. If the top crust has not colored sufficiently after 30
  minutes, move the pie to the upper rack of the oven for the last 10
  minutes. Cool the pie on a rack. Yield: One 9inch pie

      2 c  Flour
      1 c  Salt
      1 c  Water
 
   Combine flour and salt in large, flat bottomed bowl.
   Add a little water at a time, mixing as you pour to form a ball.
  Knead for 7 - 10 minutes until dough has a smooth, firm consistency.
  Add small amounts of water if necessary. Keep in plastic bag to
  prevent drying.
   When ready to use, flour hands and work space to keep the dough from
  sticking.  Roll out to cut shapes or form into desired shapes with
  hands. Join pieces together by moistening both surfaces with water
  and pressing together. Either let air dry for 48 hours, longer if
  they are thick or bake at 325 - 350 deg until surface turns light
  golden brown. The last step is to paint with acrylic paints, enamels,
  clear acrylic or varnish to seal out moisture. NOT EDIBLE, but not
  toxic.

      1 c  Lecithin granules
    1/2 tb Vitamin C powder
    1/2 tb Ginger, ground
 
  Mix all ingredients and store in tightly closed glass jar.
  
  Add 1 tb dough enhancer with each recipe calling for 2 or 3 cups of
  flour. Alternately, double the amount of yeast in the recipe to
  figure out the amount of dough enhancer to add. For instance, if your
  recipe calls for 1/2 tb yeast, add 1 tb dough enhancer.  Stir into
  dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients. Start machine.
  
  Apparently, the ginger gooses the yeast and makes it act more
  swiftly, the ascorbic acid strengthens the gluten, and the lecithin
  aids the oil in causing the strands of gluten to slip against each
  other more easily and thus rise better.
  
  THE BREADMACHINE COOKBOOK IV by Donna Rathmell German has a section
  titled "Dough Enhancers" and in that section it mentions Lecithin.
  "Lecithin is a food supplement which is obtained from oil in egg
  yolks or soy beans. It improves moisture and assists in expansion and
  elasticity of the bread dough. Add between 1 and 1 1/2 tsp. of
  lecithin granules per cup of flour."

      2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Olive Oil
      1 ts Parmesan, Grated Fine
           Cornmeal
 
  NOTE: The differences between a Pan Pizza and a Thick Crust Pizza are
  the thickness of the crust and the fact that a Pan Pizza is baked in
  a Pizza Pan with deep (2-2 1/2") sides and a Thick Crust Pizza is NOT
  baked in a pan but on stone or a tile in the oven (and then put in a
  pan to serve).
  
  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees (if planning a Thick Crust Pizza,
  place the sto tile in the oven to heat). Dissolve the yeast in the
  warm (105 degrees-115 degrees) water. Wait until the mixture foams
  (about 5 minutes). Combine the flour and yeast in a bowl. Add the
  yeast mixture. Add the olive oil. Add the parmesan. Mix thoroughly.
  Turn the dough out onto a well floured board. Knead until smooth
  (about 10 minutes). Place the dough in a greased bowl and let rise
  until doubled (about 1 hour). Punch the dough down and roll out on a
  well floured board. Roll to 3/4" thickness for Thick Crust Pizza or
  2" thickness for a Pan Pizza. Brush the dough generously with olive
  oil. THICK CRUST: Lightly oil a (14") pizza pan. Sprinkle some
  cornmeal onto the pan. Form the dough into a pie using the pan. Place
  the sauce(s) and topping(s) on the dough, leaving the outer 1/2"
  bare. Remove the pie from the pizza pan. Use a paddle to place the
  dough on the stone. PAN PIZZA: Lightly oil the pizza pan. Sprinkle
  some cornmeal in the bottom of the pan. Press the dough into place in
  the pan, pressing it down into the bottom and up the sides of the
  pan. Add the sauce(s), seasoning(s) and topping(s), leaving the
  outermost 1/2" bare Place in the preheated oven. BOTH: Bake until the
  cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden. Use a paddle to remove the
  Thick Crust Pizza from the oven and place it on a serving pan. Use
  hot pads to remove the Pan Pizza from the oven. Serve.

      Title: DOW SAH BOW/ CHA SIU BOW
 Categories: Chinese, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Cake of fresh compressed
           -yeast
  1 3/4 c  Of warm water
    3/4 c  Of sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
  6 1/2 c  Unsifted all purpose flour
 
  First you need to make the dough. This dough is good for steamed or
  baked 'bows' (buns). It will yield 2 dozen buns:
  
  For the dough, you need:
  
  Dissolve 1/2 yeast cake with sugar in warm water. Immediately add
  baking powder and then the flour. The dough will be firm and fairly
  dry. Knead on board for 20 minutes until dough is elastic and smooth.
  Place in a mixing bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a dry
  warm draft-free place until dough doubles in bulk. (about 2 1/2 - 3
  hours). Punch down the dough and knead 5 minutes more and it's ready
  to be stuffed.
  
  If you want Cha Siu Bow, you'll need:
  
  4 cups of finely diced barbecued pork 1/2 cup dehydrated onion flakes
  
  For the sauce (in Cha Siu Bow) use: 2 tsp Hoisin Sauce 2 tsp Sherry 4
  tsp Oyster Sauce 2 tsp Ketchup 1 tsp Sugar 1 1/2 tb Cornstarch 1 1/2
  cup Chicken Stock
  
  Soak the onion flakes in a cup with enough water to cover flakes. Mix
  sauce ingredients in a small sauce pan. Cook over medium high heat
  until sauce thickens. Stir in diced pork and onion flakes. Chill for
  3 - 4 hours.
  
  If you want Dow Sah Bows, use a can of sweet red bean paste.
  
  Divide the filling (pork mixture or sweet bean paste) into 24
  portions. Divide dough into 24 balls. Slightly flatten each ball then
  roll out into 4 inch discs, leaving the center twice as thick as the
  side. Place 1 portion of the filling in the centre. Gather up the
  sides around the filling, twist dough to seal. Place on a 2 inch
  square piece of wax paper, twist side down.  Allow buns to rise in
  draft-free place for another hour.
  
  You can cook them by steaming them 15 minutes. This will give you a
  white bun.
  
  You can also bake these. Preheat oven to 350. Brush with a mixture of
  1 beaten egg white, 1 tsp and 1/4 tsp sugar. Bake 20 - 25 minutes
  until golden brown. Brush with melted butter. From "Dim Sum" by Rhoda
  Yee.

      Title: DOW SEE JING PIE (STEAMED SPARERIBS WITH BLAC
 Categories: China, Ham/pork
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Spareribs
      1    Clove garlic, minced fine
      2 tb Salted black beans
      1 tb Fresh ginger, minced
      1 ts Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Sherry
 
  Here's a couple of simple, good recipes that use black bean sauce.
  Just in case you don't know, these black beans are the Chinese
  fermented black beans.  They're extremely salty++and should be rinsed
  before use++ and have a very nice, savory taste that blends well with
  many foods. Very common in Chinese markets and I've seen bottles of
  ready prepared black bean sauce in supermarkets in the Oriental food
  sections. Just substitute the deep fried tofu cubes for the meat in
  these recipes. One of these recipes is for pork spareribs and one for
  prawns. They'll give you an idea of how the beans are combined with
  the other ingredients to come up with the sauce.
  
  Yield: 4 servings
  
  Preparation:  Have butcher cut spareribs into 1-inch pieces. Trim off
  fat. Place spareribs in a heat proof dish. Wash and rinse black beans
  2 or 3 times, then mash them with garlic, ginger, soy sauce,
  cornstarch and sherry.  Mix with spareribs.
  
  Cooking:  Place heat proof dish on steaming rack in wok. Add water to
  bottom of wok.  Cover.  Steam for
       30    minutes.
  
  Do-ahead notes: Do through preparation.
  
  Comments:  Spareribs can be left in the steamer for 2 hours if dinner
  is late.  Substitute bean sauce for salted black beans++and
  abracadabra! Mein See Jing Pie Quat! (Steamed Spareribs in Bean
  Sauce.)

  it's best made at least a day ahead so the flavors fully develop. Can
  be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen as long as 3
  months. Reheat gently, adjusting water and seasoning as needed.

      Title: DOWN-HOME MASHED POTATOES
 Categories: Potatoes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    11-ounce potato per person
      1 tb Butter for each potato
           Milk as needed (1/4 to 1/2
           -cup per potato)
           Salt and white pepper, to
           -taste
           Paprika, for garnish
 
  Mashed potatoes need not be perfectly smooth; in fact, a few small
  lumps improve the texture.  Nor should the milk be premeasured and
  heated: The quantity needed will depend on the type and age of the
  potatoes. (Mealy baking potatoes that have been stored for a long
  time take more milk than new potatoes.) just pour milk in gradually,
  beating after every addi- tion, until the potatoes are just right.  A
  few minutes in the oven before serving will reheat and puff up the
  potatoes .
  
  1.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, peel
  potatoes and quarter or halve them (depending on size). Drop potatoes
  into the pot as they are peeled, even if water is not quite boiling
  yet. Cook potatoes over high heat until fork tender (about 25 minutes
  after water comes to a boil).  Some pieces can be left a little
  underdone. Drain well.
  
  2.  Place potatoes and butter in a large bowl.  Using a potato masher
  or fork, coarsely mash them together. Make a well in the center and
  pour in a small amount of milk.
  
  3.  With an electric mixer (not a blender or food processor, which
  will turn potatoes into a starchy goo) beat potatoes, adding more
  milk a little at a time as needed, until the desired texture is
  obtained. Tasting carefully, add salt and pepper.  At this point,
  potatoes can be set aside, uncovered, until the rest of dinner is
  nearly ready. one half hour before serving time, preheat oven to 350F.
  
  4.  Mound potatoes in an oven proof casserole, sprinkle with paprika,
  and bake uncovered for 20 minutes.

 Categories: Beans, Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    And 1/2 quarts water or
           -vegetable stock and stir
           -into it
      2 c  Black beans and 2 bay
           -leaves.
 
  Bring to a boil
  
  Turn down the heat and let simmer a couple of hours until the beans
  start to get tender, then heat 1/4 to 3/4 cup olive oil (how much
  will your conscience allow?) and cook in it until tender but not
  browned
  
  3 onions, chopped 2 green peppers, chopped 1 fresh jalepeno pepper,
  chopped (optional) 4 to 6 cloves of garlic, pressed 1 to 3 teaspoons
  salt, maybe more (taste it)
  
  Stir this mixture into the simmering black beans and let cook until
  quite tender and flavorful. More salt may be needed, and if you have
  a chance to let the soup sit overnight at this point, it will be even
  better. If desired, puree half or all of this to smoothness; we like
  it half-pureed, half-chunky. If you do puree it, be sure to reheat it
  before serving it, either as is or Cuban-style: bowls of steaming hot
  white rice and dishes of chopped raw onions are on the table, and
  each person stirs as much or as little rice and onions as they wish
  into their soup.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8    Beef, thin slices
      1 ts Cornstarch
           Mustard, prepared
      1 ts Paprika
      4 oz Bacon, uncooked; diced
      1 c  Tomato puree
    1/2 c  Onion; diced
      1 tb Lemon juice
      8 tb Oil
           Sour cream; (optional)
      1 c  ;Water, boiling
           Creme fraiche; (optional)
 
  Cut thin slices of roasting beef to around 4 x 6 inches off a roast.
  It is best to cut the meat WITH the grain of the meat, so the slices
  will hold together. Pound the slices lightly to flatten and tenderize
  them. Brush lightly with prepared mustard. Then sprinkle the slices
  with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. In a small bowl
  mix together the diced bacon and diced onions.  Spread the mixture on
  the meat slices. Then, starting at the narrow end, roll up the meat
  slices and secure them with skewers, toothpicks, or string.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pot.  Brown the rolls well in the oil. Add
  about 1 cup of boiling water to the pot VERY CAREFULLY! Cover the
  meat and braise gently until done, about 2 to 2-1/2 hours. Add water
  as needed to keep level fairly constant.  When the meat is cooked,
  remove the rolls to a hot plate and thicken the gravy with corn
  starch and season to taste. The sauce may be seasoned with paprika,
  tomato puree, lemon juice, sour cream, and/or creme fraiche.
  
  Serve this with a potato or pasta dish.

  it well, and put in an earthenware bowl with the onion, peppercorns,
  cloves, bay leaf, vinegar, and 1-1/3 cups water. Cover the bowl and
  allow the meat to marinate in a cool place for 4 to 6 days. Turn the
  meat twice daily, adding additional vinegar and water as needed to
  keep the meat covered. Once the marinating is complete, remove the
  meat and dry it. In a pot, heat the shortening.  Brown the meat on
  all sides and salt it to taste. Carefully add 1 cup hot water from
  the side of the pot and crumbled ginger snaps. Leave the pot to
  simmer gently with the lid on. Turn the meat from time to time,
  adding water if necessary.  The will be about 1 1/2 hours. When the
  meat is ready, serve it with the gravy in which it has been cooked
  thickened with a bit of corn starch if necessary. This is very good
  with dumplings. 

  Although this souffle is delicious on its own or with single cream,
  try it with a sauce made from (scottish) raspberries - you will find
  the combination superb.
  
  Lightly butter a souffle dish (2-pint for 4 servings) and sprinkle it
  which caster sugar.
  
  Melt the butter, stir in the flour, remove from the heat and gradually
  blend in the milk. When the sauce is smooth return it to the heat and
  bring it to the boil to thicken, stirring all the time. Stir in the
  egg yolks one at a time, then beat in the caster sugar with the
  Drambuie and vanilla essence.
  
  Whisk the egg whites until they stand in soft peaks, then using a
  metal spoon lightly and quickly fold them into the sauce mixture.
  
  Turn the souffle into the dish and bake it in the middle of the oven
  at 190 oC (375 oF) for about 40 minutes or until it is well risen and
  golden brown.
  
  Scatter a little icing sugar over the top then serve immediately.

  Adjust the parts until the dressing is to your liking. I like it
  fairly vinegary.  The amount will depend on how much vegetable you
  are dressing.
  
  Radishes:  trim and slice thinly.  The Chinese lightly smash the
  radish slices  (I use the bottom of a heavy glass), thus the salad is
  called "Smashed Radishes" (great name for getting kids to try it).
  
  Cucumbers: trim and slice thinly.  I like to score the cucumber before
  slicing it, to give it an interesting design. I usually put the
  radishes or cucumbers (or combined) in a plastic bag and pour the
  dressing over. This way I can get the air out of the bag and not
  worry about having to turn the veggies while they marinate.
  Refrigerate for at least an hour. (Longer is okay, but the veggies
  will look darker the longer they sit in the soy sauce dressing.)
  
  I take this to lunch as a relish/salad when I'm tired of dill pickles
  and pickled carrots.  I like the heat of the radishes.

      Title: DRESSING
 Categories: Turkey, Dressings
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -PAMELA BROWN   (GMNF21C)
 
   The one secret to my dressing is Salt Rising bread. My Grandmother
  always used it with other bread (we had to keep it a secret because
  my father hated salt rising even though you can not tell is is in
  there). I also have a hard time making just a little dressing and it
  always looks like I'm fixing for an army. Basically I cook the neck,
  heart, liver etc. in water to which I add 1 stick of butter and
  celery tops for flavor for my liquid. If the dressing is too dry I
  use chicken broth for additional moisture. I toast 1 loaf of day old
  white bread and 1 loaf of salt rising bread. I then break the toast
  into small pieces. Add a pkg. of Pepperidege Farm stuffing to the
  toast. Cook a good portion of chopped celery and onions in broth.
  When tender add to bread mix.  Form in to serving size balls and
  place in a buttered baking dish. Spoon additional broth over balls.
  Bake at 350 for 1 hour or until brown. We do not like soggy dressing
  so I do not stuff the turkey.  This dressing is moist and is very
  easy to serve. If I have too much for Thanksgiving I freeze the
  uncooked balls and use them at Christmas which helps speed-up dinner
  that busy day. I hope that your kids will like this recipe mine
  always liked the idea of the balls.

 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 9" pie
 
           Double-crust pastry
           -dough
    3/4 lb Dried apples
      4 c  Apple cider
    1/4 c  Plus 1 Tbsp sugar
      3 tb Cornstartch
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
      2 tb Cold unsalted butter,
           -cut into bits
      1 tb Cold milk
      1    To 3 Tbsp heavy cream
           -if desired
 
  Divide the dough into 2 slightly unequal portions, roll the larger
  portion into a round 1/8 inch thick, and fit it into a 9 inch pie
  plate. Roll the remaining dough into a round 1/8 thick and transfer
  it to a foil-lined baking sheet.  Chill the pastry.
  
  In a kettle combine the apples and cider, adding water if necssary to
  just cover the apples, bring the cider to a boil, and simmer the
  apples, covered partially, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30
  minutes, or until they are softened but not mushy.  Drain the apples,
  reserving 1/4 cup of the cider, and let them cool.
  
  Into a bowl sift together 1/4 cup of the sugar, cornstartch,
  cinnamon, and nutmeg, add the apples and toss the mixture. Add the
  reserved cider and toss the mixture until it is combined well. Spoon
  the apple mixture in the shell and dot it with the butter. Lay the
  remaining pastry loosely over the filling and crimp the edges
  together decoratively. Brush the pastry lightly with the milk,
  sprinkle it with the remaining 1 Tbsp sugar, and cut several long
  steam vents in the crust. Bake the pie on a baking sheet inteh lower
  third of a preheated 425F oven for 15 minutes, reduce the heat to
  400F and bake the pie for 30 minutes more. For an old-fashioned
  pour-through pie, drizzle the cream into the steam vents 5 minutes
  before the pie is finished baking.  Serve the pie warm with ice cream
  or sharp Cheddar as an accompaniment.
  
  This pie is a homespun American favorite.  The pour-through crust is
  an old farm tradition.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Kingfish, 1 to 1-1/2lb
      1 tb Finely sliced shallot
      2 tb Shredded green mango
      1 ts Shredded hot chilli
      2 tb Fish sauce
      3 tb Lime juice
      1 ts Palm sugar
      2 c  Cooking oil
 
  Snagged an excellent new Thai cookbook yesterday. It's
  
  "The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon Kongpan and
  Pinyo Srisawat. SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989. ISBN
  0-943389-05-4.
  
  This is a big, well-illustrated-with-color=photos book. Mike hauled
  it home yesterday with another one, "Keo's Thai Cuisine". (Being no
  dummy, he realizes that new cookbooks inspire me to cook so every so
  often he'll grab something for me to avoid having to cook himself.)
  But it wasn't that simple...  He'd bought them both, but intended to
  keep one and send one on as a thank-you gift to a fellow that took
  him and Laurie sailing a couple of weeks ago.
  
  "You get to choose one to keep."
  
  The dreaded words...
  
  I paled, started to shake. Sweat beaded my brow. I grabbed the
  fanciest one--the hard bound "Keo's" book--and paged through it, awed
  by the illustrations, impressed by the recipes. Then I grabbed
  "Elegant Taste" and started on the first page, intending to skip
  through it. Instead I went through the entire book, page by page,
  from start to finish. I slammed it shut.
  
  "This one."
  
  "Elegant Taste" explains Thai ingredients (and gives both the Thai
  names and spells them out using the Thai alphabet), makes sensible
  recommendations for substitutions and has relatively simple but very
  good and authentic looking recipes, each of which is illustrated by a
  beautiful color photo. This can be really helpful when one is cooking
  a new dish and isn't sure of what it should look like and what
  garnishes to use. Garnishes are particularly important in Thai
  cooking as they're meant to be eaten with the dish but often are not
  referred to in the recipe. For instance, in the following recipe the
  dish is presented on a platter with a half dozen or so scallion
  brushes and tomato slices, neither of which are referred to in the
  recipe.
  
  As for this recipe, some of you might remember a while back when I was
  raving about a dried, fried fish dish I'd had in a Thai place, but
  couldn't find in a cookbook. It was in "Elegant Taste" and here it is.
  
  Plan Samli Daet Diao (Fried Sun-Dried Kingfish)
  
  Preparation:
  
  Wash, clean and butterfly the fish leaving the two sides joined along
  the belly. Open the fish out flat so that the skin is downward,
  remove the bones, and score the flesh with a knife.
  
  After allowing it to dry, lay the fish opened out flat in strong
  sunshine for five to six hours, turning regularly so the sun strikes
  both the skin side and the interior.
  
  Pour the oil into a deep frying pan and place on medium heat. When
  the oil is hot, place the fish, still opened out, in the oil. When
  the lower side becomes crisp and golden, turn the fish and continue
  frying until it is done on both sides; then, remove from the pan,
  drain, place on a serving dish.
  
  Toss the shallots, mango and chilli together, seasoning with fish
  sauce, lime juice and palm sugar so that a sour taste is the
  predominant one. Spoon into a bowl and serve with the fish.
  
  Serves two to three.
  
  From "The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon
  Kongpan and Pinyo Srisawat. SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989.
  ISBN 0-943389-05-4.
  
  This dish is very savoury with a crunchy/chewy texture. The version I
  had in the restaurant still had bones but was so well fried that I
  just munched up the bones and all.
  
  Incidentally, I'm going to buy the "Keo's" book as well. It looks
  quite good too but seems to be tailored more toward Western kitchens.
  For instance, it calls for brown sugar rather than palm sugar in most
  recipes. Now that's a perfectly adequate substitution, but why bother
  when I have palm sugar on hand? (Smug grin.)

           -lemons
 
  Makes 1/4 c powdered orange peel or 1/8 c powdered lemon peel
  
  a cheese or vegetable grater
  
  Use the coarse side of a cheese grater to grate off the citrus skin in
  strips; use only the orange (or yellow) part of the skin avoiding the
  bitter white part. Spread the peel strips on two ceramic plates and
  let dry, uncovered, at room temperature, for 3 to 4 days. When the
  peels become brittle and shriveled, store them in a small glass jar.
  
  To use:  Whirl the whole dried peels in a blender or food processor
  until powdered, or use a mortar or pestle. The strong citrus oil will
  stay within the dry peels and will be released fully upon powdering.
  Use whole dried orange peel in tea blends and to perk up hot
  chocolate. Use powdered orange or lemon peel in place of extract in
  baking; also in toppings, to flavor sugar-bowl sugar and to flavor
  honey, duck, and barbecue sauces.

  Preheat oven to 350.  Lightly grease baking sheet. Stir together the
  flour, sugar and baking powder. Cut in butter until mixture resembles
  crumbs. (A food processor works great.) Stir in dried cherries and
  grated rind. Combine milk and egg. Mix into dry ingredients, gather
  dough into a ball. Roll dough out 1/2" thick onto a lightly floured
  surface. Cut into 3" circles with a sharp knife or biscuit cutter. (A
  glass does not work well because it crimps the edges and they will
  not rise as well.) Arrange on a baking sheet, 1" apart. Bake until
  firm to touch, about 20 minutes. Serve warm. From: American Spoon

      Title: DRIED TOMATO DRESSING
 Categories: Condiments, Salads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    Dried tomatoes, 4" diameter
           Vinegar, red wine
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 ts Basil, dried
      1 ts Thyme, dried
    1/2 ts Rosemary, dried
 
  Start this 6-12 hours before you want to use it on a salad.
  
  Break the dried tomato into small pieces. Put in a ceramic bowl. Pour
  on just enough vinegar to barely cover the tomato pieces. Crumble the
  dried herbs over the tomato pieces. Mix them in a bit. Add the oil.
  Stir. Leave to marinate in the fridge, stirring occasionally until
  you are ready to dress the salad.
  
  We put this on a romaine lettuce salad. The salad also had anise
  slices, and orange pieces. I don't think we put any onion in, but I
  was a bit tipsy on my friends' homemade wine when I was putting
  together the salad so can't remember what all went in it. It was a
  fairly simple green salad though. No celery or carrots or green
  peppers in it.
  
  This recipe for dressing got rave reviews from my friends and will be
  the recipe I include with the dried tomatoes I made for Christmas
  gifts this year.

     20 lb Tomatoes
           (quartered
      5 lg Onions -- chopped
     10    Celery ribs with leaves

    1/2 tb Black peppercorns --
           Crushed
     20    Whole cloves
      3 tb Salt
 
  Simmer everything together, mash the tomatoes a little, for about an
  hour; stirring occasionally.
   Puree the sauce in a blender or food processsor in small batches to
  fit your container. Return mixture to pan over very low heat, simmer,
  stirring occasionally until the mixture is reduced by half and very
  thick. (Several hours)     Spread the mixture 1/2 inch thick on
  cookie sheets and put out in the sun. As it starts to dry, cut
  through the paste in a crisscross pattern, allowing air to penetrate
  as much as possible.
     Protect the paste from insects with a storm or screen window, a
  piece of cheesecloth, or netting.  A day or two of hot sun will dry
  the mixture to where you can scrape it off the cookie sheets and form
  into nonsticky small balls.      Oven drying:  140~ about 7 hours
  Dehydrater: until you can form into nonsticky balls Let the balls dry
  a day more at room temperature, and store them in a tightly lidded
  jar. To use, dilute with a little boiling water or stock and use
  soups and sauces.

      4    Garlic cloves, large
      2 sm Onions, sliced
      1 ts Basil, dried
      1 ts Oregano, dried
    1/2 ts Rosemary, dried
    1/4 ts Ginger
     12    Dried tomato slices, 4in
           Diameter
      6 c  Water
      1 pn Salt
 
  Heat the oil in a medium saucepan on a medium heat. Slice the garlic
  in fairly large pieces and add to the oil, add the sliced tomatoes.
  Saute on mediun heat until soft. Add the herbs and ginger. Saute for
  a minute or 2 longer. Add a little water if it gets to dry. Add
  enough hot water to fill the pot, 4-6 cups worth. Cover, bring to a
  boil, reduce to a simmer. Keep covered stirring occasionally to
  prevent sticking. Taste and add a little pinch of salt if you think
  it's needed 10 minutes or so before serving. I left this simmering
  for about 3 hours. I imagine it would be ready anywhere after about
  half an hour.
  
  This made a lovely brothy tomato soup.
  
  All the herbs were whole dried. I crumbled them into the pot as the
  onion and garlic were cooking. All the ingredients except for the
  garlic, olive oil, ginger and water were homegrown and dried. Don't
  know if this will taste as good with store bought stuff. The dried
  tomatoes had no seasoning or oil on them.

      Title: DRINKING CUSTARD
 Categories: Desserts, Beverages, Kump
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 pt Milk
      1 pt Heavy cream
      1 c  Sugar
     12    Egg yolks
      1 tb Flour
 
  Eggnog is essentially a dessert sauce called creme anglaise. The
  addition of flour to this recipe is unorthodox but it enables you to
  boil the sauce without curdling it.
  
  HEAT MILK, CREAM AND SUGAR in a saucepan and bring just to a boil.
  (Do not stir--leaving the sugar on the bottom of the pot will prevent
  the milk from scorching.) Beat the egg yolks and flour together with
  a wire whisk. Add about a cup of the hot milk mixture to the yolks
  and whisk to blend. Then whisk the yolk mixture into the mixture in
  the saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil gently for
  10 seconds, then remove from heat and strain into a bowl, discarding
  the flour lumps. Chill and serve with rum, if desired.

      Title: DRIZZLE BARS MADE WITH FAILED FUDGE
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 2 1/2 dozen
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
      1 c  All-purpose flour

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  3 1/2 oz Shredded sweetened coconut*
      1    Recipe failed fudge (too
           -hard, too soft, etc)
      1 c  Candy chips*
      1 c  Walnuts; chopped
     14 oz Sweetened condensed milk
 
  * can double these amounts. For chips, choose a flavor complementary
  to fudge flavor. For instance, with chocolate fudge, use butterscotch
  or peanut butter chips. Use semisweet chocolate with almost anything
  else.
  
  Preheat oven to 375'F. Melt butter and blend with sugar and flour
  until cohesive. Then press into ungreased pan (8x8 or 9x9). Bake for
  20 to 30 minutes. While crust is still hot, spread coconut over it.
  Top with chips. Pour too-think fudge haphazardly over chips; dice
  too-hard or grainy or chewy fudge and scatter over chips. Scatter
  walnuts over that. Drizzle sweetened condensed milk over everything.
  Bake for 20 minutes, then use a spatula to press down and compact
  bars. Finish baking for 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on a rack and cut.
  
  Yield: 2 1/2 dozen 2x2-inch bars.

 Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 oz Self-raising flour
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      1    Egg, beaten
      5 fl Milk*
 
  *Approximate.  -- Sift the flour into a mizing bowl and mix in the
  sugar. Make a well in the center of the flour and drop in the egg.
  Stir in the milk gradually and mix to a creamy batter. The thicker
  the batter, the thicker the pancake will be.  Heat the bakestone and
  grease lightly. Using a large spoon, drop the batter off it in round
  "puddles" onto the bakestone, leaving room for spreading. Cook over a
  moderate heat until the top surface is covered with bubbles, and when
  the underside is golden, turn and cook the other side. When golden,
  lift off the bakestone and wrap in a cloth.  Serve as soon as
  possible with butter, honey and preserves. If any are left until the
  next day, they can be crisped under the grill before serving. For a
  change, 1 oz of butter can be rubbed into the flour and sugar:  or
  lemon essence (six drops) can be added to the batter.

  (Add additional water if beans begin to dry out. Mixture should be
  soupy with beans very soft but not falling apart.) Stir in 2
  teaspoons salt and bake beans 10 minutes more. Check seasoning,
  adding remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt if necessary. Beans may be made 2
  days ahead, cooled, uncovered, and chilled, covered. Typos by Brenda

  This dish is an excellent accompaniment to almost any Mexican meal.
  The beans should be whole, perfectly tender and swimming in a
  generous amount of broth. Source: Gourmet, July 1996

  The base can be used to make any flavor you want just by adding the
  main flavoring ingredient. For cream of mushroom soup, you would add
  fresh or canned mushrooms; for cream of celery soup, add some fresh,
  chopped celery, etc. Just add 2 cups of cold water to the magic
  mixture and put into a large saucepan.  Over medium heat, cook the
  mixture, stirring constantly, until thickened.  Add the main
  ingredient and heat for a few more minutes. If it's a little too
  thick, just add water to thin it or if it's too thin, add a
  tablespoon or two of dry milk powder.

    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      3 tb Chili powder
      2 ts Cumin
      2    Cloves garlic minced
      2 lb Steak sliced thinly
 
  Combine ingredients and thoroughly mix together. This is a dry
  marinade so there is no liquid. Sprinkle the spice mixture on the
  meat slices and work into the grain with your fingers. Cover and
  marinate overnight. Place trays in the oven and dry at 145'F. for
  first 4 hrs. then set oven 130'F. until dry.(4 to 8 hrs.) Jerky
  should be hard but not brittle. Blot up any fat that appears with
  paper towels. *For a chewy texture, slice the meat with the grain, or
  across the grain for more tender jerky. Thats all! It may take a few
  trys to figure out exactly how long to dry the meat, but you're still
  eating while you're trying so it's not that bad. Well, good luck, I
  hope that you like it. And, sorry this note is so long.

      Title: DRY FRIED PRAWNS IN THE SHELL
 Categories: Chinese, Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lb Large prawns in the shell
      2 tb Oil
    1/2 ts Salt
      3    Quarter-sized slices fresh
           -ginger, bruised
      3    Garlic cloves, bruised
      4    Green onions with tops, cut
           -into 1-inch lengths
      1 pn White pepper
      1 pn Sugar
      2 tb Dry sherry or rice wine
      1 ts Soy sauce
      1 bn Fresh watercress
 
  The trick to eating these is to pop them into your mouth and then
  separate the shells from the meat with your teeth and tongue. If the
  shells are crispy enough, eat 'em shells and all. The sauce cooks
  into the shells making them very flavorful.
  
  Leave shells and legs on the prawns. Rinse in cold water. Pat
  completely dry with paper toweling.
  
  To devein prawns, cut a 1/4-inch deep by 1/2-inch long incision down
  the outside curve of each shell. (Pointed kitchen shears are useful
  for this job.) Grasp the black vein and gently pull out and discard.
  
  Preheat a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the oil,
  salt, ginger and garlic.
  
  Crush the ginger and garlic against the side of the pan with the back
  of the spatula to squeeze out their juices (about 30 seconds); remove
  ginger and garlic and discard.
  
  When the oil is hot but not smoking, place a single layer of prawns
  flat in the pan. Fry without stirring until browned and crusty, about
  1 minute. Turn the prawns and fry without stirring until browned on
  the second side, about 1 minute. Remove and keep warm while frying
  remaining prawns.
  
  When the last batch is done, increase heat to high. Return all the
  prawns to the pan, along with the green onions, pepper, sugar, wine
  and soy sauce. Quickly toss over high heat until liquid is reduced
  and a glaze coats the shrimp, about 30 seconds. Serve on a bed of
  watercress.

      Title: DRY ROUX
 Categories: Cajun
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Information
 
  The traditional roux is an important element of many Cajun and Creole
  dishes.  It is a mixture of half flour and half fat (oil or butter)
  cooked to progressive degrees of color from blond to brown depending
  on the richness and the "smokiness" of the flavor you are trying to
  achieve, the brown being the richest. This typical ingredient is a
  problem to low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol cookery because of
  its high oil content, but making a "roux" without the oil is simple.
  
  For use in Cajun dishes, gravies and as an all around flavorful
  thickening agent.
  
  Make several cups at a time and store in tightly closed jar in
  refrigerator.
  
  Put 1 to 3 cups flour into heavy skillet and place over moderate
  heat. The amount of flour depends only on size of skillet and size of
  storage container you will use.
  
  Stir the flour around often with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Pay
  attention to the cooking because the flour will take a few minutes (5
  or so) to begin coloring. Stir constantly to keep the flour in the
  bottom of the skillet moving so that it does not burn. Continue until
  all the flour is desired color, probably about like a light peanut
  butter color. The entire process takes 15 to 20 minutes to get enough
  rich dry roux to use for many dishes. Most dishes will call for
  several tablespoons full. Later -- when the dry roux is mixed with
  liquid, it will take on a darker color.

      Title: DRY RUB & MOP
 Categories: Sauces, Rubs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           DRY RUB:
    1/2 c  Paprika
    1/4 c  Golden brown sugar
    1/8 c  Salt
    1/8 c  Granulated garlic
    1/8 c  Chipotle peppers -- ground
      1 tb Celery salt
      1 tb Onion powder
      1 tb Freshly cracked black
           Pepper
      1 tb Chimayo red chile -- ground
           MOP:
 14 1/2 oz Canned chicken broth
    1/2 c  Orange juice
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Above listed rub
 
  I like the rub a lot. Needs more black pepper, though. To me, the
  thing that makes this outstanding is the chipotles. And note that
  these are not the canned ones in adobo - they're dried. This makes
  their smokiness a bit more intense. You might not be able to find
  them, so just them out. Same for the red chiles - or you could use
  cayenne instead. Experiment! Be merry!
  
  The mop wasn't bad, but I'll try something new next time. As far as
  I'm concerned, it needs more tinkering.
  
  For the trout, the rub consisted only of lemon pepper. The mop was
  some terriyaki sauce with a little sugar mixed in. That's it!
  
  As far as technique goes, this is what I did:
  
  ~ Night before: apply rub and pop food back in fridge. ~ Next day:
  take food out of fridge and rest for an hour while smoker is coming
  up to temp (220degF or so). - Put chickens on. Mop after first hour,
  then every half hour after that. In retrospect, I will not mop this
  often in the future. Once per hour will probably do me. Total smoking
  time was about 6 hours. High winds. This was a problem, so your
  mileage may vary. I did move the birds around so as to get more even
  heat districution. Probably did that twice. - Put trout on. Mopped
  whenever I mopped the chickens. Total smoking time was about 2 hours.
  ~ Although the trout was consumed immediately, I let the chickens
  rest for about an hour afterwards.
  
  I worried more about the chickens than I did about the trout, and I
  think this affected the flavor - the trout was better! Don't fret too
  much over this - it's supposed to be fun, right?
  :^)
  
  So that's it. Comments and musings always welcome. Have a super
  weekend everybody!
