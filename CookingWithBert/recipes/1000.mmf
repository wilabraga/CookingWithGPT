      Title: "FOOLPROOF" SOURDOUGH STARTER
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 999 Servings
 
      1 c  Yogurt
      1 c  Milk
           -skim, reg or buttermilk
      1 c  Flour
 
  Mix the milk and yogurt together in a glass, pottery or plastic
  container.(NOT metal) Keep a lid on it, but don't seal it. (sealed
  starters have been known to explode!)  Put this where the temperature
  will be 80-90F for about 24 hours.  Then add the flour and put it
  back in the warm place for 3-5 days. Stir it daily.  It will bubble
  and have the odor of fermentation. It's ready to use.
  
  A starter is a live thing and must be fed.  When you use it you should
  replace what you used.  The amount you should replace will vary
  according to need. If you use your starter often or you know you are
  going to have a heavy demand soon, then you can put several cups of
  milk and flour (equal measures) in it. Generally though you should
  put in either 1/2 C to 1 C of both flour and milk.  I prefer to use
  buttermilk, as it gives the starter a much stronger sour taste.  If
  you are not going to use the starter for awhile, place it in the
  refrigerator. It needs to be fed once a week...just a few spoons
  flour or milk. If you forget and leave it in there for a long time
  without food, don't just throw it out. Try first to bring it back by
  adding 1/2c of flour and milk and leave out for a day or so.  It is
  remarkable how these things come back.

  flour, butter and sugar and stir in enough egg yolk with vanilla,
  wine, and lemon to taste to bind the dough. The dough can be made
  batter like, softer or firmer as desired. this is the outstanding
  feature of this dough to change it to your liking. For kuchens the
  dough can be made into a texture to spread or pat into the pan.
  although normally no baking powder is used, a teaspoon made be added
  for kuchen type doughs.Normally the dough is like a short dough
  similar to tart pastry.Basically for softer doughs, increase the egg
  yolks and decrease the flour. for chocolate variations add some
  baking cocoa or melted chocolate. For a tangy dough add some sour
  cream, or grated cheese for a cheese pastry dough. blend in almonds
  for a nut dough. Of importance is that the dough should be prepared
  quickly  and chilled prior to using if used for tart shells or
  pastries.Then it can be rolled out to fit tart pans etc.Prick the
  dough with tines of a fork when used for tart pastries. For kuchens
  the dough need not be chilled and may be used immediately. Double
  recipe if desired.Follow individual recipes, baking temperature
  usually from 350 to 375.Dough freezes well.

      2 tb Lemon juice
    3/4 c  Sugar; granulated
      1 tb Orange rind; finely grated
 
  James Beard's 1-2-3-4 Layer Cake; Uses three 9x1/2 inch deep cake
  pans. Makes: One 3-layered cake; Serves 12 depending on thickness of
  slices. *Note:1. If you can't find cake flour, the same amount of
  All-purpose flour can be substituted. * Directions * Preheat the oven
  to 350dF. Using your hands, butter the bottom and sides of all 3
  layer-cake pans with softened butter; sprinkle flour inside, then
  shake pans so you get a thin coating on the butter. Tip out any
  excess! Now to sift your flour. Lay a large piece of waxed paper on a
  board, put a dry measuring cup in the center, hold a sifter directly
  over it, scoop cake flour from the package into the sifter, and sift
  the flour directly into the cup. When the cup is full, draw the back
  of a knife blade lightly across the top of the cup (don't shake the
  flour down, or it will become dense) and then tip the measured flour
  into a mixing bowl. Repeat with the other 2 cups of flour (you can
  put any flour that spilled onto the waxed paper back in the sifter).
  When you have 3 cups of sifted flour in the bowl, put the baking
  powder and salt in the sifter, holding it over the mixing bowl, and
  sift it over the flour. Then, still using your hands, mix the baking
  powder and salt lightly with the flour. Next, put the butter into a
  second, large mixing bowl. If it is very firm (it shouldn't be, if
  you have left it out of the fridge), squeeze it through your fingers
  until it softens up. When it is soft enough to work, form your right
  hand into a big fork, as it were, and cream the butter. This means
  that you beat it firmly and quickly with your hand, beating and
  aerating it, until it becomes light, creamy and fluffy. Then whirl
  your fingers around like a whisk so the butter forms a circle in the
  bowl. Gradually cream the 2 cups of sugar into the butter with the
  same fork-like motion, beating until the mixture is very light and
  fluffy. As the sugar blends in it will change the color of the butter
  to a much lighter color, almost white. Now wash and dry your hands
  thoroughly. Separate the eggs as you would for a souffle', letting
  the whites slip though slightly parted fingers into a small bowl and
  dropping the yokes into a second, larger bowl. Beat the yokes for a
  few minutes with a whisk until they are well blended. Then, again
  with your hand, beat them very thoroughly into the butter-sugar
  mixture. Now beat in the milk alternately with the sifted flour --
  first one, then the other -- this time keeping your fingers close
  together as if your hand were a wooden spatula. Beat, beat, beat
  until the batter is well mixed, then add the vanilla and beat that in
  for 1 or 2 minutes. Put the egg whites in your beating bowl and beat
  them with a large whisk or and electric hand beater until they mount
  first to soft, drooping peaks and then to firm, glossy peaks. Do not
  over beat so that they are stiff and dry! Tip the beaten whites onto
  the cake batter and fold them in with your hand. Slightly cup your
  hand and use the side like a spatula to cut down through the whites
  and batter to the bottom of the bowl and then flop them over with
  your cupped hand, rotating the bowl with your other hand as you do so
  ~- exactly the technique used when folding egg whites into a souffle
  mixture with a rubber spatula. Repeat this very lightly and quickly
  until the whites and batter are thoroughly folded and blended. Once
  you have mastered this hand technique you can use it for souffles.
  Again using your hand like a spatula, pour and scrape the batter into
  three prepared pans, dividing it equally between them. Give the
  filled pans a little knock on the countertop to level the batter. Put
  the 3 pans in the center of the oven, or, if you have to use more
  than 1 rack, stagger them on the 2 middle racks of the oven so they
  do not overlap. Bake for 25 minutes, then touch the center of each
  cake lightly with your fingertip. If it springs back, it is done.
  Remove the pans and put them on wire cake rakes to cool for a few
  minutes, then loosen the layers by running the flat of a knife blade
  around the sides of the pans, put a rack on top of each pan, and
  invert so the cake comes out onto the rack, top side down. Then
  reverse the layers so they are top side up. For filling and icing,
  SEE: 1-2-3-4 Filling and Icing recipe.

    3/4 c  Orange juice; strained

  Makes: Icing and filling for one cake. SEE: Cake, 1-2-3-4 Cake by
  James Beard for the cake recipe.
  :       Mix the orange juice, lemon juice, sugar and orange rind
  together and drizzle the mixture over the three still warm cake
  layers. Be careful not to let it all soak into one spot.
  :       Then pile the layers on top of each other. The juice mixture
  will give the cake a lovely, fresh, fruity flavor and it is not rich
  like a chocolate or other candy flavored icing. Leave the cake to

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      3 tb Dark brown sugar
    3/4 c  Warm water (105F-115F)
  2 3/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
      3 tb Nonfat dry milk powder
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      1 lg Egg; -=OR=-
      2 lg Egg whites
      1 ts Salt
 
  STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into water; let stand until foamy, about 5
  minutes. For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with
  dough hook, put flour, milk powder, oil and egg or egg whites into
  bowl. Turn machine on and combine mixture. With machine running,
  slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of bowl. If
  dough is too sticky, add more flour by the tablespoon, working it in
  before adding more. If dough is crumbly and dry, add more water by
  the teaspoon, working it in before adding more. Once desired
  consistency is reached (moist but not sticky), mix dough until well
  kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds in food
  processor, about 6 minutes in mixer. If mixing by hand, put
  ingredients in large bowl. Mix well. Make well in center, pour in
  yeast mixture and work into ingredients, then knead on floured board
  until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to large
  plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal at top. Place dough in bowl.
  Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Oil a baking
  sheet. Punch dough down and shape into smooth ball. Place smooth side
  up on baking sheet. Cover loosely with oiled plastic. Let rise in
  warm spot until doubled, about 40-50 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F.
  Fifteen minutes before baking, put rack in center of oven; dust dough
  top lightly with flour. Make a decorative slash across the top. Bake
  until bread is well browned and sounds hollow when rapped on bottom,
  about 30-35 minutes. Immediately remove from pan and cool on rack.

      2 lb Chicken livers
    1/2 lb Bacon cooked crisp and
           - crumbled
      1 c  Chicken stock (preferred) or
           - bouillon
      1 lg White or yellow onion cut
           - into 8th's
      2    Stalks celery with tops
           - cut into sections
    1/4    Bell pepper
      1    Clove garlic peeled & sliced
      1 ts Heaping thyme
    1/4 ts Sage
      1    Pinch rosemary
      1    Small bay leaf
           Crushed peppercorns to taste
           Salt to taste (none with
           - bouillon)
    1/2 ts Dijon mustard
           Dry white wine or for change
           -try dry sherry
    1/2 lb Sweet cream butter (adjust
           - salt if salted butter is
           - used)
 
  UTENSILS: 2 qt. sauce pan Colander or large strainer measuring cups
  and spoons food processor, mixer or blender (use your hands only if
  slightly Masochistic) Pate molds or buttered 9" cake pan with release
  or a bowl
  
  PREPARATION: In sauce pan, combine livers, stock, spices, garlic,
  celery, onion, pepper & salt. Add enough wine to just cover
  ingredients and bring to boiling point. Reduce heat, cover, and
  simmer for about 1/2 hour. When done, place contents in the colander.
  Reserve the wine broth and allow it to stand and cool. Discard the
  bayleaf from the contents in the colander and allow remainder to cool
  for 1/2 hour.
  
  Gently ladel off the wine broth until the liquid containing the
  sediment equals 2/3 cup. Save the clear broth in case you need more.
  Be sure to catch all the sediment because it is an important part of
  the recipe.
  
  In your food processor; combine the contents of the colander, sediment
  broth, butter, mustard and 1/2 of the crumbled bacon. Process until
  the mixture is a smooth, soupy puree. Fold in remaining bacon and
  pour into final mold. If it is too thick to pour, you need to add
  more broth. Allow pate to set in refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
  
  Unmold, lightly sprinkle with cracked peppercorns and garnish with
  sliced olives and parsley.
  
  This recipe is an antique French farm recipe reported to be over 100
  years old. It is a classic recipe with wonderful spices and subtle
  flavors.

  * Experiment with unsalted seeds for different taste and texture; try
  equal amounts of pumpkin seeds, flax seeds and sunflower seeds.
  
  For best results, use the "extra knead" process and add seeds near
  the end of the first knead.
  
  Gluten is available in health food stores & nutritional departments.

      3 c  Whole Wheat Flour
      3 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Active Dry Yeast
 
  This is pretty heavy bread, but I like it that way. For a better
  raise, try adding 1/3 cup of gluten, and you may need a bit more
  water, then.
  
  Use Whole Wheat mode. Timer ok.
  
  Note: Whole wheat varies greatly in how much water it absorbs. The
  amounts of water shown are the ones that work for me. Check on the
  dough after the first few minutes of kneading. If it is too thin, add
  flour, 1 T at the time. If the dough is too dry and does not form a
  smooth ball, add water, 1 T at the time. Since bread machines can
  handle relatively moist do, it is better to err on the moist side
  (which will result in heavier bread, if it is much too much).

  The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra
  knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a
  lighter loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset
  the machine and start again - or use the whole wheat cycle, if it's
  available on your machine.
  
                               Success Hints
                               -------------
  
  If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local health food
  store.
  
  Remember the extra knead (as usual for wheat bread) - it's especially
  important for 100% whole wheat bread! You should use only the regular
  bake cycle.

  the machine and start again.  Some manufacturers produce home
  bakeries with a whole wheat cycle; if your machine doesn't have one,
  this start- again method works as an easy alternative. SUCCESS HINTS:
  The gluten gives the whole wheat flour the structure necessary for a
  good loaf. If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local
  health food store. Remember the extra knead.  It's especially
  important in 100% whole wheat bread. Because of the extra knead, us
  this recipe only on the regular bake cycle. CALORIES: 125 PROTEIN:

      2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Butter
    3/4 c  Grated unblanched almonds

      2 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Chopped pistachio nuts
           For garnish
 
  Preparation time: 45 minutes Baking time: 16 minutes
  
    1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. For cookies, sift flour, sugar and
  salt into bowl. Cut in 1 cup butter with pastry blender until mixture
  resembles coarse crumbs. Blend in almonds and vanilla. Work mixture
  with fingers until a ball of dough is formed. Then shape into 1-inch
  balls.
    2. Place balls on greased cookie sheets; make a depression in
  center of each cookie. Bake about 8 minutes; remove from oven. Dent
  again and bake about 8 minutes longer; cool.
    3. For frosting, blend 6 tablespoons butter, half-and-half and brown
  sugar in saucepan. Boil 2 minutes, stirring constantly; remove from
  heat. Cool about 15 minutes, then stir in confectioners' sugar and
  vanilla. Beat until smooth and thick.
    4. Fill depressions in cookies with butterscotch frosting and
  sprinkle frosting with nuts.
    Winner Penney L. Haney of Kenosha described these cookies: "Oh, the
  aroma! Dad knew his 'girls' had been baking as soon as he stepped in
  the back door, brushing snowflakes from his coat. He warmed his hands
  over the hot oven, slowly recovering feeling in his fingertips, numb
  from stringing red, yellow, blue, green and white lights in the pines
  in the yard. His chore and our special treat combined each year to
  mark the beginning of our holiday preparations.
    "While chatting to Mom about trying to locate the single,
  burned-out bulb that had kept an entire strand out, he watched me,
  his tiny daughter, with not so dexterous fingers, shaping dough into
  big marbles. I had to kneel on a wooden chair to reach the table,
  with Mom's brightly-colored apron wrapped around me nearly twice,
  held together in back by a giant safety pin." from the Chicago

    Winner Donna M. Farrell of Naperville entered her chocolate covered
  cherry cookie recipe: "Christmas and chocolate-covered cherries are
  forever entwined in my mind and memories. Not the expensive
  department store kind, mind you, with their dark bitter chocolate and
  runny syrup, but your basic Brach's. Each Christmas found the coveted
  white box stretching my stocking, two layers of cream-filled heaven
  with a cherry floating therein--and no requirement to share them with
  anyone.
    "Taste and calories have kept me away from the box of delights for
  many years, even after the incredible discovery that Brach's actually
  sold these morsels all year long. (How my parents managed to deceive
  me on this, I'll never know.) That is, until my mother-in-law came to
  Chicago one autumn with the ultimate cookie. A Christmas tradition in
  one bite. Nostalgia from the oven. Capable of reducing this
  36-year-old woman's taste buds and mentality to that of my 9-year-old
  daughter. A chocolate-covered cherry cookie!" from the Chicago

    Winner Jeanette McCarthy, Downers Grove, Illinois, describes her
  impatient person's "I'm hungry" cookies: "When I was a child, part of
  our Christmas celebration involved visits to my father's relatives
  during the time between Christmas and Epiphany. Great-Aunt Elizabeth
  came from a family whose women had been cooks for a wealthy family in
  Hungary. As a result, her cooking was usually slightly different and
  somewhat elegant.
    "A treasured memory of Christmas at Great-Aunt Elizabeth's house
  was a cookie that I never learned to eat in moderation. Although my
  mother warned me not to say anything, one of the first things I would
  say upon arrival was, 'I'm hungry,' hoping that these cookies would
  appear. Much to my delight they usually did, and in fact, began also
  to appear at Easter, the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and any other
  time we got together to celebrate." from the Chicago Tribune annual

    2. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, or until brown. Remove from oven and
  allow to cool completely and harden.
    Winner Jean McGree of Flossmoor "bores everyone," she says, with
  this family tale of Christmas praline cookies: "Since the time Mom
  had been a little girl, each November Grandma would surround her back
  yard pecan tree with sheets to catch the falling nuts. But most of
  the nuts had to be knocked from the branches with her long-handled
  broom. Then she would spend hours stooped over those sheets, picking
  up the pecans and sorting the good ones from the black and hollow
  shells.
    "When her daughter married and moved away, the nuts were carefully
  picked over, packaged and shipped 'up North.' Free time in the first
  week of December was always marked for shelling the pecans. Sore
  hands and stiff backs were repaid with secret nibbling and promises
  of praline cookies for Christmas.
    "Soon, I'll start looking for a package from Great-Grandma in South
  Carolina. Then, as we crack the pecans, I can retell the 'pecan
  story' to Michael and Ann, who know that Santa always looks for
  pralines on Christmas Eve." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food

      1 c  Butter, softened
      1 c  Sugar

      2 tb Whipping cream
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda

           Decorations: colored sugar,
           Raisins, chocolate
           Sprinkles, chocolate chips
 
  Preparation time: 45 minutes Chilling time: Several hours Baking
  time: 7 minutes
  
    1. Cream butter. Gradually add sugar and cream well. Blend in the
  egg, cream, baking powder, baking soda, salt and vanilla. Gradually
  add flour and mix well. Chill dough until firm, several hours (it is
  hard to roll out otherwise).
    2. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Roll out dough on a floured board to
  about 1/8- inch thick. Cut into desired shapes with a flour-dipped
  cookie cutter. Place on ungreased or lightly greased cookie sheet.
    3. Decorate with colored sugar and chocolate sprinkles and use
  raisins or chocolate chips for the eyes of the animals. Bake for 5-7
  minutes or until a little brown. Cool on racks. Don't forget to cut
  the little holes if you wish  to hang on the tree.
    Note: Dough will keep several days or a week in the refrigerator if
  you don't get around to cutting right away. I store the cookies in
  tightly covered tins and they are very good keepers if the children
  don't find them.
    Winner Beverly Bergstrom of Hinsdale recounts making rolled animal
  cookies:   "We called them animal cookies although there were many
  cutters that were not animals. We would cut small pieces of paper
  drinking straws and insert them in the top of each cookie and then
  bake them. The little piece of  straw was removed just as the cookies
  came from the oven, leaving a perfect little hole to put a colored
  string through so the cookie could be hung on our huge Christmas tree.
    "My sister and I would always make sure lots of the cookies were
  hung around the back of the tree. The tree was in the corner of the
  living room leaving a space behind, where we could crawl in. A
  favorite pastime during the holiday season was to lie on the floor
  behind the tree and using no hands, take tasty bites of the cookies,
  leaving behind the empty strings decorating the tree. Grandma would
  always pretend anger when she 'discovered' the empty strings and no
  cookie. It was a good game." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food

    Faye Kuhn, of Earlville, Illinois, recalled growing up in the tough
  times of the '40s: "Despite the lack of finances, no holiday was ever
  ignored in our household. Christmas, however, held the highest of
  honors. . . We all boarded the train and off to the city we would go.
  We would arrive home loaded with 'Evening in Paris' cologne, mittens,
  socks, handkerchiefs and coloring books bought at Kresge's and
  Woolworth's. Mom would then visit the local A & P for turkey,
  cranberries, sweet potatoes, fresh ground coffee, nuts, apples,
  oranges and one pound of butter to baste ol' Tom with. However, there
  was one thing my mother didn't do in those days and that was to bake
  Christmas cookies, for neither time nor money allowed such a luxury."
  But when her mother retired, she started baking Christmas cookies,
  Kuhn recalls. The family wanted her to make the thumbprints, yet no
  one knew the name or the recipe. "Mother put on her coat, crossed our
  back yard and knocked on our neighbor's door. She returned somewhat
  later, victorious, with recipe card in hand." from the Chicago

 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 72 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Butter or margarine,
           Softened
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Almond extract
      1 ea Egg
    1/4 c  Green sugar crystals, about
    1/4 c  Confetti or nonpareil candy
           Decorations, optional
 
   Preparation time: 20 minutes Chilling time: 4 hours Baking time: 10
  minutes
  
    1. Put flour, sugar, butter, baking powder, salt, almond extract
  and egg into large bowl of an electric mixer. Mix together, using low
  speed. Dough will be crumbly. Then knead dough with hands until
  mixture holds together.
  
    2. Remove 1/3 cup of the dough; wrap and refrigerate. Divide
  remaining dough in thirds. Using hands, roll each into a 6-inch log.
  
    3. Put sugar crystals on a sheet of wax paper. Roll each log in the
  sugar crystals to coat well; use the wax paper as a guide to press in
  crystals. Shape each log into a triangle, pressing gently on wax
  paper to give three sharp corners. Make sure to make 2 sides longer
  than the third side. Wrap each log well and refrigerate at least 4
  hours or until dough is firm enough to slice. To this point, cookies
  can be made up to a week in advance.
  
    4. Heat oven to 350 degrees. To bake, slice logs crosswise into
  1/4-inch slices. Put slices about 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie
  sheets. For each cookie, shape about 1/2 teaspoon of the reserved 1/3
  cup dough into a tree trunk. Attach to bottom underside of each tree.
  Sprinkle each cookie lightly with candy decorations, if desired. Bake
  until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Carefully remove to wire
  racks. Cool completely.
  
    Note: The logs can be divided and shaped into 3 sizes and sliced to
  form a 3-tiered tree.   These second-place winning cookies are easily
  shaped into trees that are edged with glittery green sugar.
    Of her simple cookies, Pat Egan of Dolton, Illinois writes,

           Currants, raisins, silver
           Balls and candy,
           For decoration
      1 ea Egg yolk mixed w/1 ts water
           Icing for decorating
 
   Preparation time: 25 minutes Chilling time: 8 hours or overnight
  Baking time: 7 to 10 minutes
  
    1. Beat margarine, sugar and molasses in a large mixing bowl. Add
  egg and mix well.
    2. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon,
  cloves, ginger and nutmeg. Add to butter mixture; mix well.
    3. Divide dough into 4 equal portions on a large piece of plastic
  wrap. Wrap and shape into a flat disk about 1 inch thick. Refrigerate
  until firm, about 8 hours, or freeze for 2 hours. (Dough can be
  refrigerated up to 3 days.)
    4. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Working with 1 disk of the dough at a
  time, roll out on a well-floured board, dusting the rolling pin as
  you work. Dough will be very soft and can be difficult to work with
  so work quickly and use plenty of flour. Using cookie cutters dipped
  in flour, cut into desired shapes. Put cookies 1 inch apart on an
  ungreased cookie sheet. Use currants or candy for eyes or buttons, if
  desired.
    5. Bake until lightly puffed, 7 to 10 minutes. First batch may be
  puffier because they will have less flour rolled in them. While still
  warm, paint with egg yolk wash if desired. Cool on wire racks. Cool
  completely, then decorate as desired with icing.
    Icing: Mix confectioners' sugar with a small amount of water until
  thick and spreading consistency. Add food coloring if desired and put
  in a small plastic bag. Cut a small hole in one corner and drizzle
  icing out onto the cooled cookies.
    Note: A 4-inch gingerbread cookie cutter was used in testing.
    Oak Brook's Gloria Heeter is a newcomer to the Chicago area and
  brings her favorite gingerbread cookie with her from Kansas City,
  Kan. "About nine years ago, my neighbor, Diane Collins, brought them
  over for Halloween in Halloween shapes," she says. "I took out some
  of the egg yolks and substituted corn oil margarine rather than
  shortening, which sometimes can have palm oil in it." Calling them
  "truly a cookie for all seasons," Heeter once even made them for her
  golden retriever's first birthday party. "We invited the neighborhood
  kids in for punch and cookies-cookies shaped like dogbones."    At
  Christmas, though, "I typically print the names of each person on the
  cookies, place them in a plastic bag and decorate them with a red and
  green ribbon," writes Heeter of her personalized gingerbread people.

  Ann Smith of Plainfield won second place, and described how her
  gingerbread men left Bohemia in 1872 and immigrated to the United
  States. Smith's great-grandmother, "Babicka" Novak, lived in a small
  Czech-American town in South Dakota where Smith's mother grew up in
  the 1920s. At Christmas time, her great-grandma would give her
  neighbors Old World gingerbread men, reindeer and rocking horses.
    "One year when Great-grandma delivered the cookies, she brought
  along her teenaged grandson, who was visiting from a small ethnic
  Czech community in Nebraska," Smith wrote.
    "Introductions made that day over the watchful eyes of the
  gingerbread men eventually lead to wedding bells for my parents a

  soften slightly before shaping cookies.)
  
   2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
  
    3. For topping, beat egg whites lightly with fork in shallow dish
  until frothy. Mix 1 cup nuts and granulated sugar in separate shallow
  dish.
  
   4. Roll a generous teaspoon of the dough in the palm of your hands
  into a crescent shape. Dip top of crescent in egg white and then into
  nut-sugar mixture. Place crescents on baking sheets about 1 inch
  apart. Bake until bottoms are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on pan a

   This winning recipe is from Mila Tomisek of Chicago. She prefers to
  use unsalted butter, but says margarine can be substituted. The
  cookies are very fragile.
   Mila first began baking these small, buttery, crescent-shaped
  cookies with her grandmother during World War I; today, at 82, she
  still bakes them for her children and grandchildren. from the Chicago

 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      2 c  Unsalted softened butter
      1 c  Sugar
      4 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes
  
   1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl until light and
  fluffy. Beat in flour and salt. Knead the dough briefly until smooth.

  refrigerated up to several days; soften slightly before shaping
  cookies.)
  
   2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
  
   3. Pat half of the dough out on lightly floured surface to 1/2 -inch
  thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. Place
  cookies 2 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake until light brown on
  edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
   Note: The sheep cookie cutter used by Koenig is a Hallmark cutter
  that is no longer available. A sheep pattern can be made out of
  cardboard and placed over dough; cut out the shape with a small knife.
  
   Third prize went to Betty J. Koenig, of Hammond, Ind., for her
  recipe for shortbread cookies in the shape of sheep. Betty uses a
  sheep cookie cutter to make these cookies. She suggests using your
  fingertips to dimple the dough to resemble their wooly coats. If
  desired, a small piece of chocolate can be used for eyes after
  baking. Chicago Tribune, December 13, 1990 from the Chicago Tribune

 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
      1 c  Butter, softened
    3/4 c  Lightly packed light
           Brown sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
     12 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
      1 tb Vegetable shortening
           25 to 30 caramels, cut in
           Half, rolled into balls
           Finely chopped pecans
 
  Preparation time: 50 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes
  
   1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
  
   2. Cream butter, sugar and vanilla in large mixer bowl until
  well-mixed. Stir in flour and baking powder. (If kitchen is warm,
  refrigerate dough for a few minutes; dough should be firm enough to
  roll easily.) Shape scant teaspoonsful of dough into balls about the
  size of a marble. Place on baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches
  between cookies. Flatten slightly.
  
   3. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to
  cool.
  
   4. Melt chocolate chips with shortening in top of double boiler set
  over simmering water. Remove from heat.
  
   5. Flatten caramel halves so they are the same diameter as the
  cookie. Put one caramel half on top of each cookie. (If necessary,
  use a dab of chocolate as "glue" to help caramel adhere to cookie.)
  Using a small metal spatula, spread melted chocolate thinly over top
  and sides of caramel and cookie to cover. Press chopped pecans onto
  tops of cookies. Let stand on a wire rack until chocolate firms
  (refrigerate if desired), about 20 minutes. Put into individual paper
  wrappers. Store in a cookie tin with a piece of wax paper between
  each layer.
  
   The first-place winner of the Tribune's 1991 Holiday Cookie Contest
  is Elaine Rysner. She prefers to make the cookies small - about the
  diameter of a quarter. Use high-quality caramels and chocolate for
  the best cookies. from the Chicago Tribune fourth annual Food Guide

      2 ea Eggs
      1 ea Lemon, grated rind and juice
      4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
           Pinch salt
    1/2 lb Unblanched almonds, finely
           Ground or grated
           Colored sugars for garnish,
           Optional
 
  Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 8 hours or overnight
  Cooking time: 10 minutes
  
   1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl of electric mixer.
  Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in lemon rind and juice. Mix flour,
  baking powder and salt. Stir flour mixture and ground almonds into
  butter mixture to make a soft dough. Divide dough into quarters.
  Refrigerate dough, wrapped in wax paper, until firm, at least 8 hours
  or overnight.
  
   2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
  
   3. Roll out one dough portion on lightly floured pastry cloth with a
  rolling pin covered with stocking or roll between sheets of lightly
  floured wax paper to 1/8 -inch thickness. Cut out with cookie
  cutters. Return dough to refrigerator if it gets too soft. Transfer
  to baking sheets, leaving 2 inches between each cookie. Sprinkle with
  colored sugar if desired.
  
   4. Bake until very light brown at edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer
  to wire racks to cool. Store in a covered tin.
  
   This second-place winner, from Judy M. Drux of Dyer, Indiana, makes
  very thin, crisp, delicate cookies. The dough keeps well in the
  refrigerator if well-wrapped. This cookie was a tribute to her
  husband's grandmother, Antonia Drux, who emigrated to this country
  from Germany in 1923. (Oma means "grandma" in German.) The recipe has
  been passed down as just a list of ingredients. Drux added a few
  hints to help make baking them easier for future cooks. from the

      Title: 1993 1ST PLACE: GINGER COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 80 Servings
 
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Dark corn syrup
    1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Ground ginger
      2 ts Cinnamon
      2 ts Ground cloves
      1 c  Unsalted butter or margarine
      4 c  All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
           Liquid food coloring,
           If desired
 
   Preparation time: 1 1/2 hours Chilling time: 12 hours or more Cooking
  time: 7 minutes
  
   1. Put sugar, syrup, water, ginger, cinnamon and cloves into a large
  saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture boils and sugar
  dissolves. Remove from heat. Add butter. Stir until butter is melted
  and mixture is no longer very hot.
  
   2. Mix flour and baking soda. Gradually add flour mixture to butter
  mixture and stir to blend thoroughly. Dough will have a soft texture.
  Place dough in an airtight container and refrigerate overnight or at
  least 12 hours or as long as 1 week.
  
   3. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove about one-sixth of the dough and
  knead it until it is slightly softened. Roll dough directly onto
  ungreased cookie sheets until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Use a
  cookie cutter to stamp shapes in dough, allowing a 1-inch margin
  between each cookie. Remove excess dough by lifting it and peeling it
  away. Scraps of dough can be kneaded together and re-rolled.
  
   4. Bake until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Allow cookies to cool
  slightly and become crisp before removing them from the cookie sheet.
  Cool thoroughly on wire racks. If desired, you may "paint" the cooled
  cookies using a clean, small paintbrush and food coloring that has
  been watered down slightly. Store cookies in airtight containers.
    Note: After the 12-hour resting period, this cookie dough can be
  hand-molded like clay--rolled, pinched, poked and pressed--and it
  will keep its shape, expanding slightly while baking. Thin cookies
  will become brown and bake quickly, large and thick shapes will
  require longer baking. Can be cut into any shape desired but make the
  cookies uniformly thick. The microwave oven can be used to cook the
  sugar mixture in step 1.

 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
      3 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2 ea Egg yolks, beaten
      1 tb Pure vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Salt
           Grated rind of 1 lemon
      1 c  Unsalted butter, softened

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
     12 oz Apricot preserves
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Rum
           Confectioners' sugar
 
   Preparation time: 1 1/4 hours Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes
  
   1. Sift flour into a large mixing bowl and make an indentation or
  well in the center of the flour. Add the sugar, egg yolks, vanilla,
  salt and lemon rind to the well. Mix the ingredients in the well
  together with the flour. Then cut in the butter using a pastry cutter
  or two sharp knives. At this point the dough will resemble coarse
  crumbs. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead it with your
  hands until smooth and firm. Divide dough in half and shape into two
  balls.
  
   2. Wrap tightly in plastic. Refrigerate until firm enough to roll
  out, about 1 hour.
  
   3. Meanwhile, heat the apricot preserves over low heat, stirring
  constantly. Stir in lemon juice and rum. Let cool.
  
   4. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Place the chilled dough on a lightly
  floured surface or between two sheets of floured wax paper. Roll out
  with a floured rolling pin to about 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out
  circles of dough about 2 inches in diameter. Place half of the
  circles onto greased or non-stick cookie sheets. Cut the other half
  of the circles again with a small shot glass or cookie cutter to form
  a ring shape. (Make an equal amount of rings to circles.) Place the
  rings onto buttered baking sheets. Bake until light gold, 10 to 12
  minutes. Cool a little on the cookie sheets.
  
   5. To assemble, brush the still-warm circles with the cooled apricot
  mixture. Place one ring on top of each circle and press gently (they
  break easily) to secure. Spoon a small dollop of the apricot mixture
  into the center of the cookies. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
  Cool. Store in a tightly closed tin.
  
  Infused with bits of lemon and pure vanilla and filled with apricot
  preserves and rum, the buttery rounds brought second-place honors to
  their baker, German-born Anne Kroemer of Chicago. Anne uses a wine
  glass and a smaller schnapps glass to cut out these cookies. We've
  made them slightly smaller by using round cookie cutters; biscuit
  cutters work as well. from the Chicago Tribune sixth annual Food

   1. Beat butter and granulated sugar in large bowl of electric mixer
  until light and fluffy. Slowly add flour and blend well. Remove from
  bowl and knead until shiny. Divide dough in half; wrap in wax paper.
  Refrigerate dough until it is firm enough to roll, several hours or
  longer. Let dough soften slightly on counter if too firm to roll.
  
   2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Roll dough between two sheets of
  floured wax paper or flatten dough with floured hands to 1/4-inch
  thickness on a floured surface. Use cookie cutters to make shapes.
  Transfer to ungreased baking sheets. Bake only until slightly golden,
  5 to 7 minutes. Let cool on cookie sheets just long enough to firm
  cookies and then remove to wire racks to cool completely.
  
   3. To assemble, spread half of the cookies with a small amount of
  jam and sandwich with another cookie. Put confectioners' sugar into a
  small bowl and drizzle in just enough milk to make a thin glaze.
  Frost cookies lightly with the glaze and sprinkle with colored sugar.

 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 84 Servings
 
    1/2 ts Baker's ammonia
      2 tb Milk
      6 ea Eggs, at room temperature
  1 1/2 lb Confectioners' sugar
           (about 6 cups)
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter, softened
    1/2 ts Anise oil
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 lb Cake flour, sifted
           (about 8 cups)
 
   Preparation time: 40 minutes Standing time: 1 hour plus overnight
  Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes Aging time: 1 week or more
  
   1. Mash baker's ammonia with a rolling pin if it is not powdered.
  Dissolve it in the milk in a small bowl and let stand 1 hour before
  using.
  
   2. Beat eggs in large bowl of electric mixer until thick and
  lemon-colored, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar
  until creamy and smooth. Add butter and beat again until creamy. Add
  anise oil, dissolved baker's ammonia and salt; beat to mix. Gradually
  beat in enough flour to make a stiff dough.
  
   3. Cut off pieces of dough and work in more flour on a floured work
  surface until dough is stiff enough to roll out and hold the design
  of the springerle rolling pin or mold. Roll out on a lightly floured
  board with a floured rolling pin to 1/4-inch thickness. Press design
  on dough with a floured springerle rolling pin or mold. Cut cookies
  apart using a floured knife. Leave on work surface covered with a
  clean kitchen towel overnight.
  
   4. The next day, heat oven to 325 degrees. Bake cookies on greased
  baking sheets, until barely golden on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes.
   Cool on wire racks. Store in tightly covered tins and allow to
  mellow at least 1 week before serving.
  
   Note: This recipe also can be made using 1 1/2 teaspoons baking
  powder (in place of the milk and the baker's ammonia) and anise
  extract instead of anise oil. However, the cookies will not be as
  delicately textured and the anise flavor not quite as rich. If using
  baking powder, add it with the salt to the batter.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Active dry yeast
  2 1/2 c  Water (110-degrees)
  7 1/2 c  Bread flour to 8 cups
      1 tb Salt
      1    Egg white (for glaze)
      1 tb Water (for glaze)
 
  In large bowl of electric mixer, dissolve yeast in
    2-1/2 c  water. Add 2-1/2 to 3 c flour; stir 1 minute. Batter will
  have consistency of soft pudding.
  
  Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place, free
  from drafts, overnight or at least 8 hours. The longer the sponge
  ferments, the better the flavor will be.
  
  The next day, stir in salt and 1 to 1-1/2 c  of remaining flour. Beat
  at medium speed with electric mixer 6 minutes, or beat 600 vigorous
  strokes by hand. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.
  
  Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Clean and lightly flour
  bowl. Knead dough 15 to 20 minutes or until smooth, elastic, and no
  longer sticky.
  
  Place dough in floured bowl. Dust surface lightly with flour; cover
  with a slightly damp towel. Let rise in a warm place, free from
  drafts, until tripled in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours.
  
  Grease 2 large baking sheets or 4 French-bread pans.
  
  Punch down dough. Knead 2 minutes. Cover and let rest
       10    minutes.
  
  For oblong loaves, divide dough into 3 or 4 pieces, depending on
  desired thickness of loaves.
  
  On a lightly floured surface, shape each piece into a smooth log,
  gently tapering ends. For round loaves, divide dough in half. Shape
  each half into a smooth ball.
  
  Place shaped dough on prepared baking sheets. Cover with a dry towel.
  Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Adjust oven racks to 2 lowest positions. Place a shallow roasting pan
  on lowest shelf; pour in 2 c boiling water.
  
  Preheat oven 15 minutes to 425-degrees.
  
  Slash tops of oblong loaves with 5 diagonal slashes each. Slash tops
  of each round loaf with 3 horizontal slashes and 3 vertical slashes

      Title: 3 TOFU MARINADES~ PRESSING TOFU
 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  Pressing: Split the block lengthwise.  lay several layers of paper
  towel on a flat surface; place the tofu cut side down on the towels,
  put another couple of layers of paper towel on top, cover with
  something flat and rigid (I use a cutting board) and place a weight
  on top (I use a gallon jug of brandy :-)
  
  I read somewhere that baking the tofu after pressing the water out and
  before marinating helps the tofu to absorb the marinade better. So, I
  cut up the tofu after pressing, then bake at 375 deg for 15 min. Then
  I put the tofu in the marinade, wait awhile, then stir fry or grill.
  Works great for me. From: pasquale@lanl.gov (Gina Pasquale).
  
  let it sit for 45 minutes or longer; this presses out the excess
  water in the tofu, and makes it chewier and less likely to crumble.
  It can then be grilled or baked, or cut up for use in stir-fries. I
  usually marinate it after pressing. Here are a couple of marinades to
  get you started:
  
  1) 1/2 cup light soy 1/2 cup dry sherry 2 tbs fresh grated ginger 2
  cloves minced garlic
  
  2) 1/2 cup fresh soy 1/2 cup lime juice 1 TBS ground cumin 1 TBS
  olive oil 2 serrano chiles, seeded and diced
  
  3) 1 cup orange juice 3 tbs jamaican jerk sauce

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        2    Chicken breasts -- split
        4 TB Oil
        4 TB Butter
      1/4 c  Sweet vermouth
       40 c  Garlic; peeled -- whole
  
  Melt butter in frying pan.  Add oil.  Brown chicken well on both
  sides. Remove chicken.  Add garlic and saute for about a minute. Add
  dry vermouth. Stir. Put chicken back in the pan on top of garlic.
  Cover and simmer about one hour, turning chicken every once in a
  while. When done serve chicken with cloves of garlic. Garlic will pop
  out of the shell easily and you can either mash it onto some hot
  bread or eat it plain with the chicken. The garlic carmelizes when
  cooked with the vermouth and it is almost sweet-tasting. Good luck
  and I hope you enjoy this!!

      Title: 400-CLOVE GARLIC TURKEY FROM THE STINKING ROS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Turkey
      4 oz Butter
      2 oz Olive oil
      1 c  Sage, fresh; chopped
      2 tb Garlic cloves, crushed
           Salt
           Pepper
      2 lb Garlic cloves; peeled
      2 c  Wine, white
      2 c  Stock, chicken
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  Turkey stock may be substituted for chicken stock, if available.
  
  Clean and wash the turkey and pat dry with a paper towel. Loosen the
  skin of the breast and rub the turkey under the skin with the sage
  and chopped garlic. Season the turkey inside and out with salt and
  pepper and remaining sage. Place turkey in a large roasting pan,
  preferably on a rack. Roast the turkey at 350 degrees, basting every
  twenty minutes with the melted butter and olive oil combined.
  
  An hour and half before the turkey will be finished, add the 400
  garlic cloves to the bottom of the roasting pan. Continue to baste
  the turkey and at the same time stir the cloves at the bottom of the
  pan. Then the turkey is done, remove it from the pan. Drain the
  drippings into a small sauce pan, reserving the garlic in the
  roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on a burner over medium-high
  heat. Add white wine and stock. Bring to a boil, stirring with a wisk
  to mash the roasted garlic cloves.
  
  Place the saucepan with the drippings over medium heat and with a
  whip add the flour to form a roux. Add the roux to the garlic gravy a
  little at a time until it reaches the desired thickness. Carve the
  turkey and serve with the 400-clove garlic gravy, accompnied by
  garlic mashed potatoes.
  
  This popular North Beach restaurant claims that it "seasons its
  garlic with food."  You'll see what they mean when you look at the
  list of ingredients.

           -Shredded lettuce
           -Chopped tomatoes
           -Sliced ripe olives
 
  In a skillet, melt bacon grease over medium heat. Saute meat, onion,
  garlic tomatoes, chilies and potatoes until the onion softens. Add
  salt, oregano, chili powder and cilantro; simmer 2-3 minutes. Place a
  scant 1/2 cup meat filling on each tortilla. Fold, envelope-style,
  like a burrito. Fry seam side down, in 1/2 inch of hot oil (360-375
  degrees) until crispy and brown. Turn and brown other side. Drain
  briefly on a paper towel. Place on a serving plate and top with
  shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, guacamole and salsa. Place
  shredded lettuce next to chimichanga and top with tomatoes and
  olives. Serve immediately. Yield: 12 servings. Though still debated.
  Tuscon is generally credited as the original home of the chimichanga
  (a fried "burro", as we call them, stuffed with meat, onions and
  chilies).  I've combined several recipes into this one, and it's
  fairly authentic.

  Recipe by: Rachel Hosford Spence --ALASKA <JSRKH@ACAD1.ALASKA.EDU>
  Mix the refried beans and taco seasoning together (I also mix the
  chili's in with this, but some people put the chilis as a layer) Mix
  this really well (I used a food processor, but today I am going to
  use my mixer). This is the first layer.
  
  Put a layer of sour cream on top of the refried beans, taco seasoning
  and chilis.
  
  Next put a layer of well mixed/mushed avacados (you need enough to
  cover the pan, I use a cake pan normally) on top of everything else
  
  Next sprinkle cheeses on top (I just thought about it and I put the
  avacado first and then the sour cream, but I suppose it doesnt
  matter). I think the more cheese the better myself *grin*!
  
  Next cut up tomatoes and add as many as you like, which I like to use
  at least 2 cut up tomatoes.
  
  Last put chopped up olives.
  
  Put in the oven until the cheese is melted. I use a low heat so that
  everyt else warms up.
  
  Last but not least pull out the chips and dip! Everyone really enjoys
  this dip. I hope you do too.

  A dark, moist loaf that's perfect for sandwiches! Such is the reward
  when slicing into a loaf of 7-Grain Bread. The machine's great
  kneading power makes it moist, and the 7-grain cereal makes it full
  of extra fiber.

  THis bread will not only nourish you, it will surprise you with its
  unique and delightful flavor and texture. Definetly worth the extra
  effort of finding the 9-grain mix ingredients. The mix will keep well
  in the refrigerator - we're sure you'll want to make this bread again
  (try a handful in pancakes!).
  
  Mix the water, molasses, malt and yeast.  Add the 9 grain mix, flour,
  salt and oil (you can also make a sponge and wait, but it's not
  necessary). Mix, and knead dough well. Let rise, shape into loaves
  and let rise again in oiled bread pans.  Bake at 350 F for 45 min.

      Title: 90-MINUTE SOFT PRETZELS
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  3 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour; unsifted
      2 tb Sugar

      Title: 93079 FLOUR TORTILLAS
 Categories: Mexican, Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      3 c  Unsifted flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 c  Shortening or lard
      1 c  Lukewarm water
           Shortening or lard
 
  Put flour and baking powder in bowl and mix.  Cut shortening into
  flour with pastry blender until size of peas.  Add water gradually.
  Stir until dough is stiff.  Form into a ball and knead thoroughly
  until smooth on a lightly floured board.  At this point you can
  grease the surface of the dough, cover tightly and refrigerate for as
  long as 24 hours before using; if you do this, the dough will be
  easier to handle. Let dough return to room temperature before you
  begin to roll it out (about 1 hour). Divide dough into 8 balls for
  large, thin tortillas or 11 balls for regular-sized, 7 inch
  tortillas. For large, thin tortillas, roll as thin as possible on a
  lightly floured board.  Drop onto a very hot ungreased skillet. Bake
  until freckled on one side.  (This should take only about 20
  seconds.) Lift edge with spatula, turn, and bake on second side. To
  serve at once, fold hot, limp tortilla around pieces of butter. Or
  cool tortillas, wrap airtight, and refrigerate or freeze.  To serve
  later, reheat or fry by methods described below.  Makes one dozen
  tortillas (1/16 inch thick). To reheat and soften corn or flour
  tortillas on an ungreased surface: Fresh tortillas are already soft
  in a sense, but when heated they become even more tender and
  flexible. If tortillas are dry and a little hard, dip your hand in
  water and rub it lightly onto surfaces of the bread before heating.
  Be sure not to heat them longer than necessary to soften and warm
  thoroughly, or they will become hard and brittle. Place tortillas so
  they do not overlap on a medium-hot griddle or in a heavy frying pan
  over medium-high heat. Turn frequently until soft and hot, about 30
  seconds. Put immediately into a tightly covered dish, or put into a
  foil packet and seal it, and hold in a 200 degree oven until all
  tortillas are heated. (The secret is to keep them from drying out
  once heated.) To soften corn or flour tortillas by frying:  Heat
  about 1/4 inch of salad oil, shortening, or lard in a frying pan over
  medium-high heat. Quickly turn one or two tortillas at a time in oil;
  they soften almost immediately. Do not allow them to become crisp.
  Drain on paper towels.  To crisp-fry whole corn or flour tortillas:
  Heat 1 inch of salad oil, shortening, or lard in a frying pan to
  350-375 degrees. Fry 1 tortilla at a time, using a spatula to turn
  frequently or to hold it under the fat until it crisps, puffs
  slightly, and browns lightly (about 1 minute or less).  Drain on
  paper towels.

      Title: A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS
 Categories: Beans, Soups, Text
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.
  
  Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
  thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways
  of preparing dry beans for cooking. All start with a thorough
  inspection for damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in
  cold water. The next step, which is highly recommended, is soaking
  the beans. This not only helps make the beans cook faster, it also
  improves flavor, texture, appearance and digestibility. For maximum
  improvement of these factors, it is recommended that the soak water
  be discarded and the beans rinsed and cooked in fresh water.
  
  SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.
  
  For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
  Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so
  be sure to start with a large enough pot. (Note: up to 2 teaspoons of
  salt per pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water
  more evenly.) Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
  from heat, cover and set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak
  method), but *preferably* four hours or more.  The longer soaking
  time is recommended to allow a greater amount of the gas-causing
  properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping the beans to be
  more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects. Whether you soak
  the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to DISCARD THE SOAK
  WATER.
  
  COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)
  
  Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
  kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
  teaspoons salt. Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness
  is reached.
  
  Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons
  onion salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt. Add 1
  Tablespoon chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4
  teaspoon white pepper.
  
  * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.
  
  * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.
  
  * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans
  when cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.
  
  * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker
  helps, but follow manufacturer's directions. [Personal note: Tom says
  1/2 hour in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to
  cooking them overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure
  cooker, as they expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)
  
  * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or
  kidney beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings,
  lard, oil, butter or margarine.

  Mix all ingredients in a flat container such as a dishpan or baking

  fun to make your own bubble blowers from items you find around the
  house. For example, poke the bottom out of a paper cup and dip the
  end in the mixture; also try a slotted spoon, a plastic berry basket,
  and drinking straws.

      Title: A BETTER POT ROAST
 Categories: Meats, Mine
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    First-cut brisket (5 lb)
           -trimmed of all visible fat
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Corn oil
      8    Onion(s), thickly sliced
           -separated into rings
      6    Carrots, peeled
           -cut in chunks
      3    Garlic clove(s), minced
      2    Bay leaves
      4 tb Tomato paste
           Salt to taste
     16 oz Can tomatoes, with juice
      1 c  Dry red wine
 
  Note: Make this a day ahead so you can skim off the fat. Preheat oven
  to 375øF. Cover both sides of brisket with lots of pepper. Over a
  medium flame, heat the oil in a heavy casserole or roasting dish and
  brown the brisket on all sides. Take the brisket out of the pan and
  set aside. Add the onions to the casserole and cook them over
  medium-high heat. As you stir them, scrape up the brown bits from the
  bottom of the casserole. cook the onions for about 15 minutes, or
  until they are thoroughly browned. Add the carrots, garlic, and bay
  leaves; stir for another 1-2 minutes. Take the casserole off the
  burner and carefully put the brisket back into its nest of
  vegetables. Coat the brisket on both sides with tomato paste.
  Sprinkle more pepper, and a little salt, over the tomato paste. Pour
  the tomatoes and red wine into the bottom of the casserole. Cover the
  casserole tightly, first with a layer of foil and then with the lid.
  Let the pot roast cook on the middle rack of the oven for 3« hours.
  check the liquid level in the casserole frequently; if it gets too
  low, add a little water or beef broth. When the meat is tender, take
  it out of the oven. Keep the meat covered while you cool it to room
  temperature. Then put it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day,
  spoon off all the solidified fat you can. Discard the bay leaves.
  Bring the meat back to room temperature and reheat it ÄÄ along with
  its juices and the vegetables ÄÄ either on top of the stove or in the
  oven. When it's hot, slice it on the diagonal and serve with the pan
  juices and vegetables spooned over. Add salt at the table, if needed.

      Title: A BLOOMIN' ONION
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Water; ice
           Water; boiling
      4    Eggs; beaten
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Cracker crumbs
 
  Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin off. Leave root intact
  and cut off any hanging roots. Using a small, sharp knife, divide
  onion into four sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the
  top and cutting toward root, stopping about 1/2" away. Cut each
  section twice. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to cover
  it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or petals, will begin to
  open. Remove onion from water and immerse into ice water, which will
  further the opening. Drain well by turning upside down on paper
  towel. Put flour into paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat
  with flour. Roll floured onion in beaten egg to cover. Put cracker
  crumbs or coating in bag, add onion, and shake gently to coat.
  Refrigerate 1 hour before deep frying in oil to golden brown, 3 to 5
  minutes. Cooked onion can be kept for a time in warm oven. This
  recipe was posted some weeks ago. It did not include a sauce. If I
  remember correctly, the poster said to serve with Ranch Dressing for
  a sauce. I would just let my imagination go, on the sauce! I haven't
  tried this yet, even though it is tempting...I have to watch out for
  my husband's diet, so we try to stay away from fried things. Sorry, I
  don't know the name of the original poster, but that is his/her ID,
  after the recipe title. Barb Day

    1/2 ts Red pepper
      1 tb Paprika
     12 c  Water
 
  Wash, stem and remoeve seeds from the chilies.  Put chiliesin 3 cups
  cold water and bring to a boil. After about 45 minutes to an hour the
  skins should slip off easily. Mash the pulp into a paste. If this
  seems too difficult, you can substitute chili powder at the ratio of
  1 tablespoon chili powder to a pod of chili. Read the instructions on
  the soy or TVP package to see if the product was soaked beforehand.
  If not, use some of the water to prepare this ingredient. Saute the
  onions in the olive oil until translucent. Add the garlic and spices
  , then the 12 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then add the nuggets.
  Reduce to a simmer, cook for 30 minutes to an hour.  If this seems
  too runny, you can thicken with masa, the cornmeal flour used in
  tortillas. When made in bulk, this chili can readily be frozen.

  **  THE ORANGE/ALMOND SPONGE SHEET  ** Preparing the pan. Preheat the
  oven to 375 degrees. Line the jelly-roll pan with buttered wax paper,
  leaving a 2-inch overhang at each end. Roll flour in the pan and
  shake out excess.
  
  The cake batter. Using a wire whisk or hand-held electric mixer, beat
  the 3 egg yolks in a 3-quart bowl, gradually sprinkling in the 1/2
  cup of sugar. When the mixture is thick and pale yellow, beat in the
  grated orange rind and juice, the almonds, and the almond extract.
  Slowly sift in the flour, while blending with the whisk. In a very
  clean separate bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites to soft
  peaks; sprinkle in the 3 tbsp of sugar and continue beating to form
  stiff, shining peaks. Stir a quarter of the egg whites into the
  batter; delicately fold in the rest.
  
  Baking the jelly roll. Immediately turn the batter into the prepared
  pan; bang it lightly but firmly on your work surface to settle it,
  and place it at once in the middle level of the preheated 375 degree
  oven. Bake about 10 minutes, until it has very lightly colored and
  the top is springy-do not overbake or the cake will crack when you
  roll it up.
  
  Cooling and storing. Sprinkle the top of the cake with a 1/16 inch
  layer of confectioner's sugar; cover with a sheet of wax paper and a
  lightly dampened towel. Reverse onto a tray or baking sheet. Then
  whlle the cake is still warm, holding an end of the wax paper, lift
  off the jelly-roll pan. Carefully peel the wax paper off the cake.
  Sift another 1/16-inch layer of sugar over the cake and roll it up in
  the damp towel; place in a plashc bag to keep it from drying out, and
  refrigerate. (The cake must be cold before you fill and frost it.)
  
  ** Ahead-of-time note: The sponge sheet will keep nicely 2 or 3 days
  in the refrigerator or you may freeze it for several weeks -- but to
  prevent its breaking, be sure to let it defrost completely before
  unrolling it.
  
  **  THE MERINGUE BASE-ITALIAN MERINGUE  **
  
  Beat the egg whites in the electric mixer until foaming through out;
  add the salt and cream of tartar and continue beating until soft
  peaks are formed. Turn mixer speed to slow. In a small saucepan bring
  the sugar and 1/2 cup water to the simmer, remove from heat, and
  swirl the pan until the sugar has dissolved completely and the liquid
  is perfectly clear. Cover the pan tightly and boil to the soft-ball
  stage (238 degrees). Using moderately slow speed, gradually whip the
  hot syrup into the egg whites; increase speed to fast and continue at
  high speed for 5 rninutes, until egg whites form stiff shining peaks
  and have completely cooled. Plan to use the meringue promptly.
  
  **  MERINGUE MUSHROOMS  **
  
  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Scoop a quarter of the me ringue
  into the pastry bag and squeeze out 8 to 10 half-inch domes on the
  pastry sheet, to serve as mushroom caps. Hold the l/8-inch tube over
  the end of the pastry bag and squeeze out 8 to 10 conical shapes 3/4
  inch high, for the stems. Bake about 1 hour in the middle level of
  the oven, until the meringues push easily off the pastry sheet-they
  should color no more than a darkish cream. Return unused meringue to
  the main mixture. ** Ahead-of-time note: Meringues may be made in
  advance and frozen.

      Title: A BUCHE DE NOEL   --   FRENCH YULE LOG CAKE
 Categories: Xmas, Holidays, Cakes, French
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           This file completes the
           .  directions.
 
  **  THE FILLING AND FROSTING  **
  
  Beat the smoothly melted chocolate into the meringue, along with the
  vanilla, rum, and soft butter. Remove two-thirds of the mixture to a
  bowl and refrigerate; this is the frosting. Beat the additional half
  stick of soft butter into the remaining meringue this is the filling.
  
  **  FILLING THE CAKE  **
  
  Unroll the sponge sheet and slice a quarter inch off the long sides
  so that the cake will roll easily. Spread the filling over the top of
  the sheet. Roll it up from one of the small ends and you have made
  the log shape. Neatly slice a narrow slanting piece from each end of
  the log. With a small knife dig a hole in an upper side of the log
  and insert a piece of the scrap to simulate a bump or a branch. Place
  the log seam-side down on the serving board and slip double sheets of
  wax paper under the edge of each side and the two ends-to catch
  frosting spills.
  
  **  FROSTING THE LOG  **
  
  Beat 2 or more spoonfuls of sifted cocoa into the frosting mixture to
  make it a spreadable consistency. (Reserve 2 spoonfuls of frosting
  for the mushrooms.) Leaving the two ends free, frost the cake using a
  flexible metal spatula, then scumble it with the spatula and a fork
  to give it a rough barklike look.
  
  ** Ahead-of-time note: Refrigerate the log if you are not contin-
  uing; it will keep nicely for a day-if you can find a non-mashing
  cover for it.
  
  **  FINAL DECORATIONS, JUST BEFORE SERVING  **
  
  The mushrooms. With a small knife, pierce a hole in the bottom of each
  meringue mushroom cap, insert a bit of the frosting (or softened
  butter) into the hole and then the pointed end of a meringue stem.
  Arrange the mushrooms in tasteful clusters upon the log and sprinkle
  the log with a dusting of confectioner's sugar to give a snowy
  effect. Dust the tops of the mushrooms with cocoa powder tapped from
  the sieve.
  
  The caramel veil. Bring the sugar to the simmer with the corn syrup
  and one-third cup water in a small saucepan; when the mixture is
  completely dissolved and clear, cover tightly and boil to the caramel
  stage. Let it cool two to three minutes, until it forms thick strands
  when lifted with a fork. Then dip the fork into the syrup and wave it
  over the broomstick, to form long hanging threads of caramel.
  
  The finale. Lift the caramel strands off the broomstick; drape them
  over the yule log. Decorate the serving board with sprigs of holly if
  you wish, and the buche de Noel is ready to serve.

  sweet). Excellent for candying and as garnishes for desserts and tea
  sandwiches. Good in salads.

 Categories: Medieval, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Shortcrust pastry
      1    Egg white, beaten
           Until liquid
      1 lb Boned breasts of chicken
           Pigeon or wild duck and/or
           Saddle of hare or rabbit
           (not stewing meat)
           Salt and black pepper
      1 lb Minced beef
      2 tb Shredded suet
      3    Hard-boiled egg
           Yolks crumbled
    1/4 ts Each ground
           Cinnamon and mace
           And a pinch of ground cloves
      1 oz Stoned cooking dates chopped
      1 oz Currants
      2 oz Stoned prunes soaked
           And drained
    1/2 c  Beef stock
      1 tb Rice flour or cornflour
 
  No Christmas feast in medieval times was complete without a 'grete
  pye'. In some recipes, it could contain many varied meats, but quite
  often only two or three different kinds were suggested; change the
  meats suggested here if you wish. Use just over half the pastry to
  line a 23-cm/9-inch pie plate. Brush the inside with some of the egg
  white. Skin the pieces of breast and other meat if necessary and
  parboil them gently in salted water for 10-15 minutes.  Drain and
  leave to cool. Mix together in a bowl the minced beef, suet, salt and
  pepper to taste, the egg yolks and half the spice mixture. Add the
  rest of the spices to the dried fruit in another bowl. Slice the
  parboiled meat. Pre-heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas Mark 7. Add 1 or 2
  tablespoons of the beef stock to the rice flour or cornflour in a
  small saucepan and cream them together; then add the remaining stock
  and stir over gentle heat until slightly thickened. Keep aside. Cover
  the bottom of the pastry case with half the mince mixture. Arrange
  the sliced meat in a flat layer on top. Scatter the chopped spiced
  fruit over it and cover with the remaining mince.  Pour the thickened
  stock over the lot. Roll out the remaining pastry into a round to
  make a lid for the pie. Brush the rim of the case with a little more
  egg white and cover with the lid. Press the edges to seal, and make
  escape slits for steam. Decorate with the pastry trimmings and glaze
  with egg white. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to
  160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 and bake for 45-50 minutes longer. Serves 6 to
  8. Grete pyes. Take faire yonge beef, And suet of a fatte beste, or

      Title: A JELLIE OF FYSHE
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Cod
      3    Scallops
      3 oz Shrimp
      2    Onions sliced
      1 tb White wine vinegar
      1 oz Ginger root, peeled,
           Finely chopped
    1/3 ts Sea salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
      2 c  White wine
      2 c  Water
    3/4 oz Gelatin
 
  Put the codfish (or other white fish) in a pan with the onions,
  vinegar, ginger root, spices, wine and water. Bring it gently to the
  boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the scallops and prawns and cook
  for a further 3 minutes. Remove the fish; bone and skin the white
  fish and set it all aside. Strain the cooking juices and set aside to
  cool for several hours by which time a lot of the sediment will have
  settled in the bottom of the bowl. Carefully pour off the juices,
  leaving the sediment, and then strain several times through a clean
  teacloth. You should have appoximately 3 cups of liquid left. Melt
  3/4 oz of gelatin in a little of the liquid, cool it to room
  temperature, then mix it into the rest of the juices. Pour a thin
  layer (1/2 inch) of the juice into the bottom of a 5 cup souffle dish
  or fish mold and put it in the fridge to set. Flake the white fish
  into smallish flakes; remove the coral from the scallops and cut the
  white flesh into three of four pices. Once the jelly is firm, arrange
  the most decorative of the fish in the bottom of the dish-- some
  scallop coral in the middle, prawns around the outsides, flakes of
  white fish in between or however you feel inspired. Spoon a little
  more of the juice and return it to the fridge to set. Continue to
  layer the fish in the mould, setting each layer with a covering of
  juice until you have used up all the fish and juices. Leave the jelly
  to set for at least 4 hours in a fridge. Unmold and decorate with
  fresh herbs; serve as a starter.

  water to remove the gamey taste; drain. Cut the meat in serving size
  pieces as you would chicken, salt and pepper the meat, cover with

      3 sm Carrots, diced
      2 sm Parsnips, diced
      1 md Turnip, cut in chunks
      2 ea Celery stalks, diced
           Celery leaves from

      1 sm Bn flat-leaf parsley
      1 ea Bay leaf
           Fresh rosemary and thyme
           Black peppercorns
 
  Put 3 quarts of water in the bottom of a large stock pot with a pasta
  insert. Add the tomato liquid and tomato paste. Put all of the other
  ingredients in the pasta insert. Bring to a boil over high heat,
  lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 3 hours. Lift out the
  pasta insert, letting out the liquid fall back into the pot. Press
  down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible and return
  all the liquid to the pot. Discard the solids.
  
  Note: This started out to be vegetable stock to use up some leftover
  stuff I had on hand, but after I strained the stock I decided to use
  it as a cooking liquid for pasta. The pasta thickened and flavored
  the stock to such an extent that I decided to save the leftovers to
  use as a tomato-vegetable soup. I may add some vegetables and small
  pasta to that.

  add the rest of the ingredients, mix well. Put the container into the
  refrigerator chill over night. Take out and roll small pieces of the
  dough into long strips, then form them into a figure eight,(like a
  pretzel) put them back into the Refrigerator for about an hour, when
  they have raised to approximately what looks to be the right hight.
  Bake in a 450 deg pre-heated oven for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, (
  May vary with the weather so keep an eye on them).But they should be
  a light brown before you remove them. Refrigeration is one of the
  keys of "KRINGLA" making. They must be refrigerated in order for them
  to get the flavor, you could bake them without refrigeration but you
  lose a lot of the flavor. You can also use. A:  OATMEAL. B: RAISINS.
  C: WHOLE WHEAT. You can fill them with your favorite filling, Cream
  Cheese, Jelly, ETC. you don't need eggs or yeast. They are not too
  sweet, and definitely not Boring like a bagel, (Sorry Bagel lovers,
  VBG). It is a coffee Bread not like Muffins, which are too sweet, and
  also do not have too many calories. This recipe came from a fella
  from the town of LOS OSOS CA He is a out of work Carpenter who
  started baking and selling these wonderful Rolls, He said that this
  is an original recipe that he got from his grandmother, (Yea for the

      Title: A SHORTCUT TO SOAP MAKING
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
      1    Information
 
  If you do not wish to handle lye, do not have wood ashes available,
  or do not have the time to make soap from scratch, you can still make
  homemade soaps.  You can purchase castille granules at most
  drugstores. There is no need to mess with lye when using these
  granules. Since they are actually granulated soap, it is easy to make
  soap from them.
  
  Put the granules into a kettle and add water. Instructions for use
  will probably be on the package. If not, use common sense in adding
  water. (Don't drown the granules.) Heat the mixture at low to medium
  heat and stir it constantly with a large wooden spoon. The granules
  will dissolve. Stir the mixture until it is smooth. Remove it from
  the heat and add any other ingredients or emolients that you want.
  Stir them in well as the soap cools.  Add perfume (if desired) as
  they very last ingredient. Blend it in so that the fragrance will be
  evenly dispersed. Pour the mixture into molds, and let harden. If the
  soap does not set (that is, if the bars do not get hard) reheat the
  mixture, adding more castille granules as necessary. Before it cools
  completely, you will need to add more perfume because reheating the
  mix will release the volatile floral oils, thus destroying them.

 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------SQUID DISH--1475---------------------------
 
   Platina mentions several odd fishes not usually used today as food,
  such as cuttlefish, scorpions, lampreys and sea-lion. But most of his
  fish are still favorites-eels, lobsters, crabs, oysters, sturgeon and
  sturgeon eggs (which he calls caviar),  salmon, sole, etc., and he
  gives a recipe for a Squid Dish for Days of Abstinence. Although
  squid is eaten today in the South of France and Greece, and can be
  found in special fish shops here, I would prefer salmon or halibut.
  But if you hanker for squid, just go ahead with it if you can find
  some, and be sure to have the fish man prepare it for you by removing
  the black liquid from the backbone. A SQUID DISH FOR DAYS OF
  ABSTINENCE--1475 Boil the squid. Crush what is good in a mortar.
  Prepare a paste of almonds with rosewater strained through a sieve;
  or, if you can't provide this, use the juice of peas or white
  chickpeas. Crush together small grapes and five figs. Mix a little
  rock parsley and a little fresh marjoram leaves. Add as much
  cinnamon, ginger and sugar as is necessary. Mix these well with
  whites of eggs so that they will stick together and cook better. With
  the mixture well greased, and with a crust above and beneath, set it
  on the hearth at a little distance from the flame. Sprinkle sugar and
  rosewater on the cooked mixture. This dish assails all the members.

      Title: A TO Z OF SPICES (PART 1)
 Categories: Info/tips, Spices
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No Ingredients
 
  ALLSPICE: These small dark, reddish-brown berries are so called
  because their aroma and flavor resemble a combination of cinnamon,
  cloves and nutmeg. Use berries whole in marinades; for boiling and
  pot roasting meats and poultry; in fish dishes, pickles and chutneys.
  Also available ground and excellent for flavoring soups, sauces and
  desserts.
  
  ANISE: Commonly called asniseed, these small, brown oval seeds have
  the sweet, pungent flavor of licorice. Also available ground. Use
  seeds in stews and vegetable dishes, or sprinkle over loaves and
  rolls before baking. Try ground anise for flavoring fish dishes and
  pastries for fruit pies.
  
  CARAWAY: Small brown, crescent-shaped seeds with a strong liquorice
  flavor and especially delicious as a flavoring in braised cabbage and
  sauerkraut recipes, breads (particularly rye), cakes and cheeses.
  
  CARDAMOM: Small, triangular-shaped pods containing numerous small
  black seeds which have a warm, highly aeromatic flavor. You can buy
  green or black cardamoms although the smaller green type is more
  widely available.
  
  CAYENNE: Orangey-red in color, this ground pepper is extremely hot and
  pungent. Not to be confused with paprika which, although related, is
  mild flavored.
  
  CHILI POWDER: Made from dried red chilies. This red powder varies in
  flavor and hotness, from mild to hot. A less fiery type is found in
  chili seasoning.
  
  CINNAMON & CASSIA: Shavings of bark from the cinnamon tree are
  processed and curled to form cinnamon sticks. Also available in
  ground form. Spicy, fragrant and sweet, it is used widely in savory
  and sweet dishes. Cassia (from the dried bark of the cassia tree) is
  similar to cinnamon, but less delicate in flavor with a slight
  pungent 'bite'.
  
  CLOVES: These dried, unopened flower buds give a warm aroma and
  pungency to foods, but should be used with care as the flavor can
  become overpowering. Available in ground form. Cloves are added to
  soups, sauces, mulled drinks, stewed fruits and apple pies.
  
  CORIANDER: Available in seed and ground form. These tiny, pale brown
  seeds have a mild, spicy flavor with a slight orange peel fragrance.
  An essential spice in curry dishes, but also extremely good in many
  cake and cookie recipes.
  
  CUMIN: Sold in seed or ground. Cumin has a warm, pungent aromatic
  flavor and is used extensively in flavor curries and many Middle
  Eastern and Mexican dishes. Popular in Germany for flavoring
  sauerkraut and pork dishes. Use ground or whole in meat dishes and
  stuffed vegetables.
  
  All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark
  place, as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.

      Title: A TO Z OF SPICES (PART 2)
 Categories: Info/tips, Spices
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No Ingredients
 
  FENUGREEK: These small, yellow-brown seeds have a slight bitter flavor
  which, when added in small quantities, is very good in curries,
  chutneys and pickles, soups, fish and shellfish dishes.
  
  GINGER: Available in many forms. Invaluable for adding to many savory
  and sweet dishes and for baking gingerbread and brandy snaps. Fresh
  ginger root looks like a knobby stem. It should be peeled and finely
  chopped or sliced before use. Dreid ginger root is very hard and
  light beige in color. To release flavor, "bruise" with a spoon or
  soak in hot water before using. This dried type is more often used in
  pickling, jam making and preserving. Also available in ground form,
  preserved stem ginger and crystallized ginger.
  
  MACE & NUTMEG: Both are found on the same plant. The nutmeg is the
  inner kernel of the fruit. When ripe, the fruit splits open to reveal
  bright red arils which lie around the shell of the nutmeg - and once
  dried are known as mace blades. The flavor of both spices is very
  similar - warm, sweet and aromatic, although nutmeg is more delicate
  than mace. Both spices are also sold ground. Use with vegetables;
  sprinkled over egg dishes, milk puddings and custards; eggnogs and
  mulled drinks; or use as a flavoring in desserts.
  
  PAPRIKA: Comes from a variety of pepper (capsicum) and although
  similar in color to cayenne, this bright red powder has a mild flavor.
  
  PEPPER: White pepper comes from ripened berries with the outer husks
  removed. Black pepper comes from unripened berries dried until dark
  greenish-black in color. Black pepper is more subtle than white. Use
  white or black peppercorns in marinades and pickling, or freshly
  ground as a seasoning. Both are available ground. Green peppercorns
  are also unripe berries with a mild, light flavor. They are canned in
  brine or pickled, or freeze-dried in jars. They add a pleasant, light
  peppery flavor to sauces, pates and salad dressings. Drain those
  packed in liquid and use either whole or mash them lightly before
  using. Dry green peppercorns should be lightly crushed before using
  to help release flavor, unless otherwise stated in a recipe.
  
  POPPY SEEDS: These tiny, slate-blue seeds add a nutty flavor to both
  sweet and savory dishes. Sprinkle over desserts and breads.
  
  SAFFRON: This pice comes from the stigmas of a species of crocus. It
  has a distinctive flavor and gives a rich yellow coloring to dishes,
  however, it is also the most expensive spice to buy. Available in
  small packets or jars (either powdered or in strands - the strands
  being far superior in flavor). This spice is a must for an authentic
  paella or Cornish Saffron Cake. Also an extremely good flavoring for
  soups, fish and chicken dishes.
  
  SESAME SEEDS: High in protein and mineral oil content, sesame seeds
  have a crisp texture and sweet, nutty flavor which combines well in
  curries and with chicken, pork and fish dishes. Use also to sprinkle
  over breads, cookies and pastries before baking.
  
  STAR ANISE: This dried, star-shaped seed head has a pungent, aromatic
  smell, rather similar to fennel. Use very sparingly in stir-fry
  dishes. Also good with fish and poultry.
  
  TURMERIC: Closely related to ginger, it is an aromatic root which is
  dried and ground to produce a bright, orange-yellow powder. It has a
  rich, warm, distinctive smell, a delicate, aromatic flavor and helps
  give dishes an attractive yellow coloring. Use in curries, fish and
  shellfish dishes, rice pilafs and lentil mixtures. It is also a
  necessary ingredient in mustard pickles and piccalilli.
  
  All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark
  place, as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.

      Title: A&W ROOT BEER
 Categories: Top secret, More
      Yield: 5 Cups
 
    3/4 c  Granulated Sugar
    3/4 c  Hot Water
      1 l  Cold Seltzer Water
    1/2 ts Plus 1/8 t root beer-
           Concentrate (McCormick is-
           Best)
 
  1.  Dissolve the sugar in the hot water. 2. Add the root beer
  concentrate and let cool. 3. Combine the root beer mixture with the
  cold seltzer water, drink immediately, or store in fridge in tightly
  covered container.
  
  The root beer you'll make here is a simplified version of Roy Allen's
  method from the early 1900's.  Instead of harvesting roots, herbs, and
  berries, you have the luxury of using a root beer concentrate that
  can be found in most grocery stores. In 1922 Allen expanded his
  business, he formed a partnership with entrepreneur Frank Wright.
  This led to the name that would become famous, A&W, the country's
  best-selling root beer.

MMMMM-------------------KLINGON STEAMED BREAD------------------------
      1 c  White cornmeal
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/2 c  All-bran cereal
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ginger
    3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
    1/2 c  Dates, chopped
    2/3 c  Powdered skim milk
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  Honey
    1/2    Orange; unpeeled
      1 c  Rhubarb; chopped
           Margarine; to grease cans
      2    37 oz empty cans
 
   Mix together in a bowl all the dry ingredients including dates and
  walnuts (leave out only the buttermilk, honey, orange half and
  rhubarb). Put the buttermilk and the honey in the blender. Wash an
  orange, cut off any price or brand marks and cut it in half. Cut the
  orange half into chunks and add it to the blender, being sure that
  you have removed all the seeds. Run the blender until the orange
  chunks are chopped into little bits. Now add the buttermilk mixture,
  along with the rhubarb chunks, to the dry ingredients and mix well.
   Pour immediately into greased cans, filling each can no more than
  two-thirds full. Cover the filled cans with aluminum foil, and secure
  the foil with a rubber bands. Place them in a large pot, on some kind
  of a rack so they are not touching the bottom of the pot. Pour in hot
  water until the bottom 2 inches of the cans are covered. Bring to a
  boil and keep the water boiling gently for about 1 1/2 hours.
   The pot should be covered and there should be a little steam
  escaping at all times. Check the pot occasionally to make sure that
  there is enough water left.
   At the end of 1 1/2 hours, check with a skewer, right through the
  foil. If it does not come out clean, cook for another half hour and
  recheck. When the loaves are done, take the "hot" cans out of the
  pot. When you are ready to serve, uncover a mold, shake the loaf out
  onto a breadboard and slice it. Serve warm with butter or cream
  cheese.

      Title: AARGAU (CARROT CAKE)
 Categories: Switzerland, Cakes, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      5 ea Egg; separated
    275 g  Sugar, granu;ated
      1 ea Lemon; juiced
      2 ea Lemons; zest, grated
    250 g  Almonds; ground
    300 g  Carrots; finely grated
     75 g  Cornflour
      1 pn Cinnamon, ground
      1 pn Cloves, ground
     10 g  Baking powder
     50 ml Kirsch
      1 pn Salt

MMMMM--------------------------GLAZING-------------------------------
     50 g  Apricot jelly
           Fondant icing
           Marzipan carrots
 
    The Story: The cultivation of vegetables in Aargau is one of the
  main reasons for the existence of a thriving canning/bottling
  industry. In this area, the carrot is the Queen of all vegetables and
  it has attributes which allow it to be used everywhere, even in
  desserts.
    This carrot cake is now a Swiss classic, its reputation having been
  extended long ago far beyond the borders of the canton. Some maintain
  that the cake is better two days after baking as the carrots keep it
  moist.
    The Recipe: Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and
  lemon zest, until light. Add the finely grated carrots and the
  almonds.
    Mix in the cornflour, cinnamon, ground cloves and baking powder.
  Then add the kirsch. Mix or beat until smooth. Beat the egg whites
  until stiff and carefully fold in.
    Butter a tin (24 cm diameter, 5 cm high), dust with flour. Turn the
  mixture into the tin. Bake in the oven for 50 ... 60 minutes at 180
  oC. When cooked, brush the cake with a hot apricot glaze and thin
  fondant icing. Decorate with small marzipan carrots.

      Title: AARONSON CORN MUFFINS
 Categories: Breads, Nw
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------SUSAN AARONSON PSTT79C------------------------
  1 1/3 c  Flour
    2/3 c  Cornmeal
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
        pn Salt
      1 c  Sour cream
      3    X-lg eggs
      5 tb Butter; melted
     12 oz Can Green Gian Mexicorn;optl
    1/2 c  Bacon; coarsely chopped
           Cupcake papers
 
  I like to add the Mexicorn and bacon to this recipe. It certainly does
  enhance the flavor, but if you want plain corn muffins, you can
  certainly omit these 2 ingredients. Preheat oven to 400~. You'll need
  either one or two 12 unit muffin tins, lined with cupcake papers.
  Whisk the dry ingredients together, throughly, in a bowl and set
  aside. Whisk the sour cream, eggs amd melted butter together until
  well-blended. Make a well in the dry ingredients, pour in
  cream/butter/egg mixture and if you're adding the corn and bacon, add
  them now. Using a spatula, fold the ingredients together, just until
  combined--DON'T OVERMIX. Spoon the mixture into the lined muffin
  tins, filling them evenly, about 3/4 full. Bake for 20-25 minutes,
  testing until a wooden pick comes out clean. Let me know if these
  muffins are what you're looking for.  I have more recipes if they're
  not. Enjoy.......Susan MM Format Norma Wrenn npxr56b

 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Frozen artichoke hearts
        x  Italian herbs
        x  Balsamic vinegar
        x  1 t olive oil
      1    Onion, chopped fine
      3    Garlic cloves Peeled and
           Squinched up into little
           Pieces
      1 lg Package of mushrooms,
           Sliced
    1/2 c  Or so f/f parmesan cheese
      2    Spoonsfuls of f/f mayo and
           F/f sour cream.
      1 ds Worcestershireshshchestshire
           (you know what I mean)
 
  Marinate artichoke hearts with italian herbs and some balsamic
  vinegar. I myself add a teaspoon or so of olive oil (someone will be
  coming to measure me now, I'm sure).
  
  Stir artichoke hearts and rest of ingredients together. DON'T put in
  so much white stuff that it is too moist because the mushrooms will
  release moisture and then it will get gross.
  
  Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes in a French White Corning Ware
  casserole. If you put it in anything else it will explode.
  
  This is great as a dip, or in a pita sandwich.  I hope you like it,
  and I promise not to post too often until I actually learn to measure
  and write :-)

 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5    (7 1/2-ounce) cans Mexican
           -abalone
      8 oz Shrimp
      4 oz Fat pork
      4 oz Water chestnuts, minced
        pn Chives
           Ginger water, to taste (see
           -note)
           Salt and MSG
      1 oz Maize (corn) flour
      4 oz Chive and ginger oil
           -(see note)
      2 oz Flour
      3    Eggs, beaten
    5/8 oz Shaoxing wine
      6 oz Chicken stock
 
  The following four recipes are from a Chron article called "Foreign
  Intrigue" by Alice Cuneo that featured recipes from various
  consulates in the City.  This first one is from the Consulate of the
  People's Republic of China.  It's a sophisticated (but uncomplicated)
  banquet dish featuring abalone, shrimp and porkfat.
  
  Abalone stuffed with minced shrimp, from Shen Xuliang of the Chinese
  consulate.
  
  Trim the abalone, removing rough parts, and cut into flat rounds. Chop
  shrimp and fat pork to a paste consistency; stir in the water
  chestnuts, chives and ginger water. Season with salt and MSG.
  
  Create the abalone "sandwiches" by spreading an abalone round with
  shrimp paste, then topping with another round. Dredge "sandwiches" in
  maize flour and set aside.
  
  Heat chive and ginger oil in a wok over medium heat, swirling the oil
  to coat all sides of the wok.
  
  Dip the abalone "sandwiches" in the flour, then in eggs. Fry in the
  hot oil until abalone is tender and golden. Add Shaoxing wine,
  chicken stock, salt and MSG. Bring to a simmer, adjust the seasonings
  and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTE:  Chive and ginger oil is oil in which chives and ginger have
  been cooked.  To make at home, heat 4 ounces oil in a wok set over
  medium heat. Toss in 1 or 2 tablespoons fresh snipped chives and 3
  slices fresh ginger. Stir-fry until fragrant, then proceed with
  recipe. (Remove ginger slices before serving.)
  
  Ginger water is available in Chinese markets.

     12    Fresh shiitake mushrooms
     24    Chinese pea pods
      4    Fresh medium abalone
      2    Limes,or more (juice only)
      1    1-in. fresh gingerroot ***
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 tb Rice vinegar
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      4 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
           Salt, pepper
           Lime or lemon wedges (opt)
 
  Note: If abalone is not available, substitute sea scallops cut into
  paper-thin slices. *You may substitute watercress instead of arugula.
  **May use red cabbage instead of radicchio. ***Gingerroot should be
  peeled and grated. Rinse and dry lettuce, arugula and radicchio.
  Discard mushroom stems and slice tops in thin vertical slices. Rinse
  and dry peas. Remove abalone from shells, using handle of heavy spoon
  to break muscle attachments. Reserve shells. Clean abalone well,
  discarding undesirable parts. Clean shells thoroughly, dry and set
  aside. Using meat slicer, slice abalone muscle crosswise into
  tissue-thin pieces. If abalone can't be sliced tissue-thin, slice
  thin as possible and pound each slice on flat surface with mallet or
  flat end of cleaver until tender and almost transparent but not
  shredded. Combine juice of 1 lime, 1 tablespoon grated ginger and
  grind or two of fresh pepper in bowl. Add abalone slices and toss to
  coat well. Marinate 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Combine
  remaining lime juice, remaining ginger, vinegar, soy sauce and 3
  tablespoons olive oil in small bowl. Tear lettuce, arugula and
  radicchio into coarse pieces and place in large bowl. Toss with
  dressing oil. Arrange greens in abalone shells or on serving plates.
  Set aside. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet or saute
  pan, add mushrooms and peas and season to taste with salt and pepper.
  Stir-fry briefly, just until peas turn bright green. Remove from heat
  and toss to mix well. Pile hot mixture on top of greens in abalone
  shells. Top with abalone slices. Garnish with lime or lemon wedges,
  if desired.

  minute but do not allow flour to brown. Add milk and cook and stir 1
  or 2 minutes until mixture comes to boil and thickens. Set aside. For
  abalone, melt 1 tablespoon butter in small saucepan, add shallots and
  cook until tender but not browned. Add crabmeat and heat thoroughly.
  Add enough white sauce to bind, about 1/2 cup. Season to taste with
  salt and white pepper and add red pepper, mustard, Worcestershire and
  lemon juice. Carefully pound abalone steaks between 2 sheets of waxed
  paper until very thin (unless purchased already pounded). Dip abalone
  in eggs seasoned to taste with salt and white pepper. Coat with flour
  and set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy skillet. Add
  abalone and brown quickly on one side. Turn and brown other side. Do
  not overcook as abalone will toughen. Place abalone steaks on platter
  and spoon crabmeat stuffing on each. Roll and arrange on serving
  platter, seam down. If desired, serve with any remaining sauce.

 Categories: Breakfast, Desserts, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
      1    Egg
      2 tb Oil
      3 tb Nonfat Dry Milk Powder
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Salt
  3 1/2 c  Bread Flour
  2 1/2 ts Yeast
    1/2 c  Powdered Sugar
 
  Place all ingredients except sugar in machine. Program for knead and
  first rise and press start. The dough will be sticky at first but
  will hold its shape. After the final cycle, it will be workable. When
  dough is finished, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and let
  it rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough to a generous 1/4" thick and
  cut it into 2" squares.
  
  Cover the squares with a clean towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Add
  the powdered sugar to a medium-size clean paper bag. Lay out paper
  towels to drain the doughnuts. Heat 1 to 1 1/2 " of oil to 375øF. Do
  not add too many; add once or it may cool the oil too much. Gently
  brush the uncooked squares to remove any extra flour. Slide them into
  the heated oil. When they pop to the surface, spoon the hot oil over
  them constantly until they are puffed. Turn the squares and cook
  until they are a light golden color on both sides. It should take 1
  to 2 minutes. Cut the first couple of squares in half to be sure
  there is not sticky uncooked dough inside.
  
  Remove from hot oil with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
  While warm, drop them, 3 or 4 at a time, into the bag with powdered
  sugar and shake until they are well coated. Serve immediately.

    3/4 c  Rye sourdough starter*
    1/4 c  Flat beer
      2 tb Water
 
  Place in pan in the order given. Bake on basic bread cycle. This can
  probably be timed. With only 2 cups of flour, this makes a small (14
  oz) loaf with a crunchy crust and a light interior.  Not a dense
  bread. It's a rustic looking loaf that ought to be just the thing
  with stews or hearty soups. *Rye sarter: 2 c Rye flour, 2 c warm
  water, 1 pkg yeast in a glass container.  Leave at roomtemp for about
  3 days stirring when you think of it.  When it starts to smell like a
  brewery, you can refrigerate it. Just bring it back to room temp
  before you use it. Adapted from BREAD MACHINE BAKING, Brody & Apter

  seem to miss them.  Next time I'll add more dill and onion. The jars
  were almost empty when my baking fit struck me, so I went with what I
  had.
  
  I baked it on the regular bake cycle.  It rose almost to the top of
  the pan and is a lovely golden color. Tastes pretty good, too.
  
  *Starter:  2c all purpose flour, 2 c warm water, 1 pk yeast. Combined
  and left in oven all night with the light on. It doesn't have a name

 Categories: Breadmaker, Holidays
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
           -LISA CRAWLEY (TSPN00B)
      2 tb Sugar
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    3/4 c  Eggnog; at room temp.*
 
  I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for
  the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may
  need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
  it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
  dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
    * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
  microwave) Place ingredients. in the B/M according to your
  manufacturers' directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as
  needed This made a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of
  my breadmaker. I used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness
  or darkness button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a
  Welbilt). Let me know your results, we sure enjoyed it! FROM: LISA

  What is a bagel?
  
  A bagel is traditionally a hefty, dense ring of somewhat bland tasting
  bread. But with different flours, such as rye and wheat, bagels take
  on different tastes. Add raisins, blueberries, strawberries, dates
  and nuts for a dessert-like bagel. Add veggies, onions, poppy seeds,
  peanut butter and other ingredients for an infinite variety of taste
  combinations.
  
  The popularity of bagels is as much attributed to what you can put on
  them and in them as to what you add to the unbaked dough. They are
  the perfect vehicles for spreads. Most often spreads consist of a
  cream cheese base that may be mixed with salmon or lox, fruits,
  vegetables and spices -- in myriad combinations. There are regional
  differences in how bagels are made, and ongoing arguments about what
  constitutes the "perfect" bagel and best spread combination.
  
  The traditional bagel sandwich consists of cream cheese, lox, a slice
  of onion and a slice of tomato. But that's only the beginning. Bagel
  sandwiches are so popular that bagel bakeries often list 40 or 50
  sandwich variations on their menus. then there are mini bagels and
  bialys. For catered bagel brunches, there are 3- to 6- pound bagels
  that are filled and then cut into pie shaped wedges.
  
  Bagels have a lot going for them. They don't crush or smash while
  being carried; they don't melt from the heat or suffer from freezing.
  They're at their optimum goodness when fresh and hot from out of the
  oven, but they're delicious, too, even when frozen, thawed and
  toasted. If they get stale, they can be made into bagel chips or
  ground into bread crumbs. They're an all-around convenient, no-waste
  food product that is well suited to today's health conscious
  consumers.
  
  The plain water bagel is low in calories compared to other traditional
  breakfast foods. Estimates as to the number of calories in a bagel
  differ, and its size is a factor. Most bagels weigh 4 to 5 ounces,
  and tally up to between 150 to 200 calories. The addition of nuts,
  raisins, berries, chocolate chips and other ingredients will add to
  the count. I saw a cracked wheat bagel in a health food store that
  had 320 calories. Some bagels weigh 6 ounces. Mini bagels may be 1 to
  3 ounces, so the calories vary accordingly.
  
  It's the toppings and spreads that shoot up the calorie tab, though
  this can be tempered by using light and fat-free cheeses, and spreads
  without cheese. A whopping dollop of cream cheese slapped onto each
  half of a bagel (2 tablespoons of cream cheese have 10 grams of fat
  and 100 calories) will wipe out the innocence of the plain bagel. Two
  tablespoons of regular preserves (there are sugar free varieties,
  too) can add on 50 calories but no fat. And peanut butter? Well, you
  would rather not know, if you're counting calories and grams of fat.
  
  Still, you're better off with bagels than with a doughnut, which has
  176 calories and 11 grams of fat. A homemade bran muffin (not the
  giant restaurant or bakery size) has 112 calories and 5 grams of fat.
  A large croissant has 300 calories, 17 grams of fat and 85 milligrams
  of cholesterol. The butter will do it every time. There is no butter
  in a bagel recipe. Only egg bagels have cholesterol; even that can be
  eliminated using egg whites instead of a whole egg (or 1/4 cup liquid
  egg substitute). But a sweet roll with nut and raisin Danish filing,
  and icing, can top them all with about 360 calories, 2.3 grams of fat
  and 82.2 milligrams of cholesterol.

  The process is simple. Initially, the boiling procedure may seem
  strange, but once you've done it, you'll wonder why you hesitated.
  Just boil a pot of water as you would for spaghetti, and boil the
  shaped bagel for about 2 minutes, turning once. Your first few bagels
  may not come out round and smooth on top, but they'll taste good
  anyway. Be patient. The second batch will look better; by the third,
  you mat think you're ready to go into business.
  
  Basically, these are the basic steps required to make bagels. We'll
  go into each in detail.
  
  1. Mix, knead and first rise: Mix flour, water, salt, sugar (or malt
  or honey) and yeast, knead them and let the dough rise for about an
  hour. Mixing and kneading can be done in a bread machine, a food
  processor, a heavy duty mixer, or by hand. this same procedure is
  used to make any yeast bread.
  
  2. Shape bagels: Form the dough into the traditional bagel shape by
  rolling, poking a hole in a ball or using a bagel cutter.
  
  3. Second rise: Allow a short rest and second rise period, about 20
  minutes.
  
  4. Boil or "kettle": Drop the bagels into boiling water for 1 to 3
  minutes and drain. You can bake immediately or refrigerate for 1 to
       24    hours.
  
  5. Glaze and apply topping: This step is not essential to the final
  product.
  
  6. Bake: Bake in a preheated oven for 20 to 35 minutes.

  STEP 1: MIX, KNEAD AND FIRST RISE:
  
  The Bread Machine:
  
  The bread machine yields excellent results every time when you use
  fresh ingredients and follow directions. Set the machine on "dough
  cycle", and let it produce a dough with the texture of velvet and the
  stiff consistency required.
  
  When using a bread machine, add ingredients in the order recommended
  in your manufacturer's instructions. The recipes in this series have
  ingredients listed for machines that require adding liquids first and
  dry components last.
  
  Reverse the order for those that add dry ingredients first and wet
  ones last. Process on the "dough mode," or "program", or "mix bread
  cycle" or whatever it is termed by your machine's instructions. Allow
  the dough to rise through the full first rise period after the
  kneading phase, between 35 minutes and 1 hour.
  
  On shorter cycles, and depending on the weather and moisture of the
  ingredients, you may have to leave it in the machine for 10 or 15
  minutes longer, or until the dough fills about 2/3 of the pan. Whole
  grain flours may require up to 1 to 2 hours for the first rise. Do
  not allow the dough to bake in the machine.
  
  Dry ingredients such as spices, cinnamon, nutmeg and finely chopped
  nuts are added with the fours at the beginning. Wet ingredients such
  as mashed bananas, applesauce, pumpkin, grated carrots and frozen
  berries are added with the liquids, but if you add more wet
  ingredients to the recipes in this series, their liquid content must
  replace an equal amount of liquid. Adding raisins and other dried
  fruits at the beginning is not recommended; most bread machines
  pulverize them so they're hardly visible in the finished bagel.
  
  Check dough about 5 minutes after you have started the machine. The
  dough should form a nice round ball. If a ball doesn't form, and the
  mixture appears crumbly, add water, a tablespoon or less at a time,
  until the correct consistency is achieved. If dough looks too wet or
  formless, add flour, a tablespoon or less at a time, until the dough
  forms a ball.
  
  Add ingredients such as raisins, dates, chocolate chips and apple
  pieces about 5 to 8 minutes before the end of the kneading phase.
  Some machine beep to indicate the optimum time to add nuts or
  raisins. Check your manufacturers instructions for the time required
  for each process in the dough cycle. If your machine does not provide
  this timed signal, determine the length of the kneading phase and set
  a timer for 5 minutes before the end; then open the machine and
  carefully add the ingredients, being sure that they do not spill onto
  the heating elements. Ingredients can also be kneaded into the dough
  by hand after it is removed from the machine.
  
  NOTE: When adding reconstituted dried foods to the dough in a bread
  machine (5 to 10 minutes before the end of the kneading phase), foods
  should be blotted very dry with a paper towel so that any retained
  moisture does not change the texture of the dough and inhibit it from
  rising properly.
  
  A 60 minute rise period is ideal. It's ok to open the machine and
  quickly test the dough during the rise period. Gently push your
  finger into the dough, and if the dent remains, dough is ready. If
  the impression bounces back, let dough rise a few minutes longer and
  retest. Dough can become slack if allowed to rise too long. White
  flour rises highest. White flour combined with whole wheat, rye and
  oats will not rise as high. Generally, the darker the dough, the
  lower the rise and the longer it takes.
  
  When ready, remove dough form the pan and proceed to step 2: Shape
  Bagels.

  THE FOOD PROCESSOR
  
  A food processor will knead dough ingredients very quickly and
  easily. It will reduce the process to a few minutes, even cutting
  down the time of the a bread machine. Our testers found the results
  extremely reliable. One tester much preferred it to the bread machine
  because he was in charge all the way and never had a failure. By
  mixing and kneading in the food processor and allowing the dough to
  rise in the microwave, bagels can be ready for boiling in under a
  half hour. You can optionally use the microwave for the first rise
  for dough that has been mixed in the bread machine, by hand or with
  an electric mixer. Then work the flavoring ingredients into the dough
  after the first rise as you would for dough made in the bread
  machine. Either active dry yeast or fast-rising yeast can be used.
  
  1. Mix 1/4 of the liquid to 110-115 degrees in the microwave and add
  to the yeast and sugar in a small cup. Mix gently and let sit for 5
  minutes. Pour remaining liquid in a cup and make it very cool, right
  out of the refrigerator, or add an ice cube.
  
  2. Put the metal cutting blade into the food processor bowl. Measure
  flour and salt and put them into the processor bowl. Pulse tow or
  three times, just enough to mix the flour and salt. Add any oil or
  butter and pulse until it disappears, tow or three pulses.
  
  NOTE: Most food processors can mix 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 cups of flour.
  However, it's possible to mix a larger or double batch of dough. If
  the machine balks, it will stop automatically. Let it cool down and
  restart it. Or divide dough in half and continue processing each half
  separately. When mixed, knead the two batches together.
  
  3. Pour yeast mixture into flour through the feeding tube and pulse
  for another 5 or 10 seconds until it forms a ball. Pulse a few more
  times to knead. When dough appears to come away from sides, it is
  ready.
  
  4. Remove dough from the processor bowl and hand-knead to remove any
  gases. Let it rest for about 5 minutes. If it's not elastic enough,
  add a few more drops of water; if it's still too sticky, add a
  sprinkle of flour until it is smooth, velvety and elastic. The first
  rise can be done in a microwave oven in about 15 minutes or in a bowl
  in a draft-free environment for about 1 hour. Microwave ovens vary in
  wattage, so the rise period and settings may vary. You may have to
  experiment.
  
  To use a microwave oven, after the dough is kneaded, carefully remove
  it and the metal blade from the processor bowl. Form dough into a
  rectangle long enough to wrap once around the processor bowl. Grease
  dough with oil or nonstick vegetable spray, but do not cover bowl.
  (Be sure the bowl has no metal parts.) Place the bowl in the
  microwave.
  
  Method 1: Microwave on LOW (30%), or DEFROST (about 30%), for 1
  minute. Let rest for 10 minutes. Repeat microwaving and resting 1 to
  2 times, until the dough has doubled in size. Test with your fingers
  until a dent remains. If the dough springs back and dough has not
  doubled, microwave once more for a few minutes until a dent does
  remain and dough appears doubled in size.
  
  Method 2: Or, place dough in the processor bowl as instructed.
  Position an 8-ounce microwave-safe cup filled with water in the back
  corner of the microwave. cover the processor bowl lightly with a damp
  tea towel or plastic wrap and place it in the microwave on LOW (30%),
  or DEFROST (30%) setting. Heat for 3 minutes, rest for 3 minutes,
  heat for 3 minutes and rest for 6 minutes, repeating the 3-minute
  heat and the 6-minute rest once or twice if necessary, until dough
  has doubled in bulk.
  
  To allow dough to rise in a draft free environment, place dough in a
  large bowl lightly oiled with vegetable oil. Turn dough so all
  surfaces are greased. Cover with plastic wrap sprayed with nonstick
  vegetable spray and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2
  hours.
  
  Proceed to Step 2: Shape Bagels.

  THE HEAVY DUTY MIXER WITH A DOUGH HOOK
  
  A heavy duty electric mixer with a dough hook will make short work of
  mixing small or large batches of dough quickly.
  
  Combine the warm liquid (110-115 degrees), syrup, honey or sugar, oil
  and yeast, and then add half the flour and all other dry ingredients.
  Add remaining flour until a ball forms.
  
  The dough hook will do part or all of the kneading, which should take
  about 5 minutes. If the dough begins to strain the machine, add more
  water so it becomes softer (check your manufacturer's directions; a
  heavy duty mixer with a dough hook should have no problem kneading).
  When dough appears near desired consistency, remove it from the bowl
  and knead in extra dough until it forms a soft ball. Follow the same
  first rise procedures as in the hand mixing or food processor
  methods. If a fast-rising yeast is used, the first rise is not
  necessary.
  
  Proceed to Step 2: Shape Bagels.
  
  BY HAND:
  
  Mix together warm water (110-115 degrees), yeast and 1 tsp. sugar and
  let stand for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, add remaining sugar, salt
  and 2 cups flour. Stir in the yeast mixture. Add remaining flour,
  stirring to form dough.
  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board. Knead dough by hand,
  adding more flour as necessary, for 10 to 15 minutes until dough is
  smooth, shiny, stiff and elastic. Keep the board and your hands
  dusted with flour to prevent sticking.
  
  Knead by pushing down on the dough with the palms of your hands,
  exerting pressure from your shoulders. Lift the dough from the top
  edge, turn it a quarter turn, fold it in half, press again, turn,
  fold, press, and repeat the process until dough forms a cohesive
  ball. When the dough is no longer sticky, stretch it to help develop
  elasticity. Knead it a few more times (by now you should be about
  ready to drop dead and buy frozen Lender's <G>.) Drop it on your
  board, lift it, pick it up again and drop it again, continuing to
  stretch, drop and knead a few more times. If it becomes too stiff,
  add a few drops of water; if too sticky, add a little more flour.
  When optimally kneaded and shaped into a ball, dough will spring back
  when poked gently.
  
  Place dough in a lightly greased bowl. Turn dough so all surfaces are
  greased. cover with a sheet of plastic wrap sprayed with nonstick
  vegetable spray and let rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour.
  the test for proper rising, which about doubles the mass of the dough
  in size, is to poke two fingers lightly and quickly about 1/2" into
  dough. If dent stays, dough is doubled.
  
  Proceed to Step 2: Shape Bagels

  STEP 2: SHAPE BAGELS
  
  Prepare baking sheets by lightly greasing them with nonstick vegetable
  spray, or oil with a little vegetable oil spread with your fingertips
  or waxed paper.
  
  Reach into the bread machine pan and pull dough out (if it is slightly
  sticky, dip your fingers into flour first.) Some machines punch dough
  down automatically at the end of the rise cycle, and just the act of
  removing the dough from the pan is usually adequate to remove gases,
  but you may need to punch dough down to remove any remaining air. Or,
  remove dough from bowl or food processor bowl and punch down.
  
  Knead dough once or twice and let it rest for 5 minutes. If the dough
  is still a little too wet and sticky, lightly flour the bread board
  or your hands and knead the dough manually, until it has a smooth,
  elastic consistency. Bagel dough should be stiff but elastic; if it's
  too stiff, sprinkle a little water on it or moisten your hands and
  knead the moisture into dough. After you've made one or two batches
  of bagels, you'll get the feeling of the ideal consistency.
  
  Roll and pull dough into a rectangle about 10x14" for a 1-pound
  recipe and 14x18" for a 1 1/2-pound recipe, and let it rest for 5
  minutes. Sprinkle with dried fruits, nuts, vegetables, seeds, spices,
  chocolate, or any combination of flavorings. Roll dough into a log
  and knead the ingredients into the dough for a minute or so.
  
  The dough should weigh a little more than the size recipe you are
  using. Divide dough into pieces depending on the size bagel you want.
  A 1 1/2-pound recipe yields 8 to 12 finished bagels, each weighing 2
  to 3 ounces, measuring about 4 inches across. Use a food scale if you
  want consistency, or measure with a ruler. Cut smaller pieces for
  mini bagels. Knead in added ingredients well before shaping each
  bagel. You can also divide dough and add different ingredients to
  each part so you get a varied batch of bagels from one recipe.

  Shape using any of the following methods:
  
  HOLE IN THE MIDDLE METHOD: Roll each piece of dough into a ball, poke
  a floured finger through the center to form the hole, and then shape
  top and smooth sides. Moisten your finger with water, if necessary to
  smooth. Pull gently to enlarge hole. The resulting bagel is smooth
  and there is no joint.
  
  OR, press the round on your floured board. Using the index fingers of
  both hands, poke a hole an pull dough until the hole is large, and
  then round out the bagel and smooth the top and edges.
  
  THE HULA HOOP AROUND THE FINGER METHOD: Create a circle without a
  joint by flattening a ball of dough slightly into a round shape,
  folding the bottom edge under and smoothing it until it looks like a
  mushroom top. With a floured index finger, make a hole in the center
  of the circle from the bottom up. Twirl the circle around your index
  finger, or two fingers, like a hula-hoop, to widen the hole. Pull out
  and shape the round.
  
  THE ROPE METHOD: Roll each piece of dough into a rope by rolling it
  on the bread board or between your hands. Wrap the rope around four
  fingers, overlap and join the ends, and turn the circle inside out.
  Until you get this hand movement down pat, you may have to moisten
  the ends to hold them together. Initially the length may be lumpy and
  the joint will show. It takes practice.
  
  OR, roll dough into 30" lengths, cut each length into thirds (each 10"
  long) and join the ends. If you become proficient at this hand-made
  method, make 10" marks on the edge of your bread board so your bagels
  will be a consistent size.
  
  BAGEL CUTTER METHOD: Roll dough out to a flat shape about 1/2" thick.
  Cut with a bagel cutter and smooth the tops over the sides so they're
  rounded, using a little water on your fingers to smooth, if
  necessary. Knead scraps again, reroll and cut into as many more
  bagels as there is dough. If you don't have a bagel cutter, use a
  wide champagne glass to cut out the outside. Cut the inside hole with
  the edge of a cordial glass or the small end of a measuring jigger.
  Any leftover dough can be rolled into two strips and made into a
  bagel twist (separate recipe), sealing ends with a dab of water so
  they don't untwist while boiling and baking.
  
  Place shaped bagels on the greased baking sheet for the second rise,
  spacing them at least an inch apart to allow for the second rise.
  Proceed to Step 3: Second Rise.
  
  STEP 3: SECOND RISE
  
  During the second rising of the dough, the bagels will puff up on the
  greased baking sheet. cover them with a length of plastic wrap
  sprayed with nonstick vegetable spray or a very lightly dampened
  cloth such as a tea towel. Place them in a draft free location and
  let them rise at room temperature until puffy, about 20 minutes.
  
  NOTE:  Bagels can be refrigerated at this point, should you decide to
  boil and bake them later, or the next morning. Leave them covered so
  they do not dry out. Remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm
  slightly while you boil water and preheat the oven.
  
  The second rise can be speeded up by using the microwave. Fill a 2-cup
  microwave-safe measuring cup with water and bring the water to a boil.
  Place in a corner of the microwave. Place the baking sheet of covered
  bagels in the microwave and close the door, but so not turn on the
  microwave. The bagels should rise in a bout 6 minutes. (It won't

  STEP 4: BOIL OR "KETTLE"
  
  Fill a 4- to 6- quart soup pot with water 3 to 4 inches deep. Water
  alone can be used, or add 2 tbs. malt syrup, honey or sugar.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400F., so it's ready when you're through boiling
  the bagels.
  
  Drop bagels one at a time into the boiling water. Boil about 4 at a
  time or only so many that they float freely and so not crowd; they
  will expand further in the hot water. The bagel may sink to the
  bottom for a few seconds, and then float to the surface. Simmer for
  30 seconds to 1 minute on each side, turning with a slotted spatula.
  Remove and put on a lightly greased rack or a lightly floured tea
  towel for a few minutes to drain.
  
  HINT: Put the top side of the bagel down into water first, and then
  turn over.
  
  When you remove them, the bagels will be top side up and slide off
  your spatula for draining and adding toppings.
  
  When cool enough to handle, proceed to Step 5: Glaze and Apply
  Topping, or if you omit this step, proceed to Step 6: Bake.
  
  STEP 5, OPTIONAL: GLAZE AND APPLY TOPPING
  
  GLAZES: Brush tops with glaze either before placing them in the oven
  or about 5 minutes into the baking and then again about 5 minutes
  before the end of baking. I've tried all the glazes listed below on
  the same bagels in one batch, using white flour bagels and whole
  grain flour bagels. Despite claims in some cookbooks that different
  glazes yield different shades and crustiness, I found no appreciable
  difference in either color or texture of the crusts when applied to
  bagels. You may have a different result.
  
  Water Glaze: A spray or brushing with room-temperature tap water will
  yield a subtle glaze similar to using the steam baking method
  (described elsewhere in
  
  directions). Try brushing some bagels at the beginning of the baking,
  some 5 minutes after and some near the end, and compare the
  differences.
  
  Nonstick Vegetable Spray Glaze: an easy, quick, effective, low calorie
  glaze is a spray of nonstick vegetable spray. It goes on more evenly
  than using a brush, yet yields an even glaze. Spray before placing in
  the oven and again about 5 minutes before baking time is completed.
  
  Melted Butter or Margarine Glaze: This glaze produces the same effect
  as vegetable oil. Watch the bagels carefully so they don't burn.
  
  Egg Glaze #1: Mix together 1 egg white, 1 egg yolk or 1 whole egg
  with 1 tbs. water, milk, or cream.
  
  Egg Glaze #2: Lightly beat 1 egg white. You can brush it on the bagels
  either before they are put into the oven or 5 minutes after baking
  time has begun, and 5 minutes before the baking is finished.
  
  Cornstarch Glaze: Dissolve 2 tbs. cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water.
  Bring 1 cup water to a boil and whisk the dissolved solution into the
  boiling water until it thickens. This cornstarch mixture can be kept
  in the refrigerator for several days. Brush it on the bagel tops at
  the beginning of the baking and again as soon as you remove the
  bagels from the oven for a very high shine.

  TOPPINGS: A variety of toppings can be added to the bagel before
  baking, either directly to the dough after settling, or after the
  bagel is glazed. Poppy seeds, sesame seeds, caraway seeds and coarse
  salt are easiest to use because they can be placed in a dish directly
  from the jar, and the bagel can be dipped into the dish; the seeds
  adhere to the moist dough. Or they can be sprinkled on top of the
  bagels just before baking, and pressed down lightly to adhere. I've
  seen bagels with sparse toppings and those that are covered from top
  to bottom. There's no right or wrong way.
  
  Add 1/2 cup finely chopped, sautéed onions to the tops of the bagels.
  
  Add 1/2 cup finely chopped raw onions to the tops of the bagels; they
  will cook right along with the bagels.
  
  Use dehydrated onion flakes or packaged onion soup that you have
  reconstituted with water, olive oil, or vegetable oil. Use 1 tbs. dry
  product to 1/2 tbs. water or oil, and soak for 2 to 3 minutes.
  
  Mix together 1/2 cup chopped yellow onions, 1 green onion (white part
  only), 2 tsp. olive oil, 2 tsp. poppy seeds.
  
  Sprinkle with garlic salt, finely chopped fresh garlic or garlic
  flakes.
  
  For the "Everything Bagel" (see recipe), combine 1/2 cup finely
  chopped onions, 1 clove garlic, finely chopped, and 1/4 cup sesame
  seeds. Sprinkle mixture on bagel tops before baking.
  
  Use ground caraway or whole caraway seeds. These are particularly
  good on rye bagels. They can be combined with the topping for the
  "everything bagel".
  
  Sprinkle with red pepper flakes, adjusting the "heat" to your liking.
  
  Top with mixed fresh herbs, including parsley, chives and dill.
  
  Dip into or distribute about 1/4 cup coarse salt or kosher salt on
  top of 1 batch of bagels just before baking.
  
  Poppy, caraway, sesame and celery seeds can be used directly from the
  jar. Just dip the bagels into a dish of seeds or sprinkle seeds on
  top.
  
  Toasting nuts before using them on (and in) bagels enhances their
  flavor. Walnuts, almonds, pecans or hazelnuts can be used on bagels
  as toppings and also added to the dough at the beginning or before
  they are shaped and rise the second time.
  
  Sprinkle with rolled oats or multigrain cereal, which will brown while
  baking.
  
  Proceed to Step 6: Baking

  STEP 6: BAKE
  
  Place bagels on a shelf just below the middle in a preheated 400F.
  oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are a nice
  golden brown.
  
  BAKING SURFACES:
  
  Bake the bagels on a baking sheet. The easiest surface available to
  most home cooks is an aluminum cookie sheet or flat Teflon-coated
  sheet pan. Coat with a little oil and sprinkle very lightly with
  yellow cornmeal to prevent bagels from sticking. Or line the pan with
  parchment paper; it eliminates the use of oil and cornmeal and
  cleaning pans.
  
  Bake the bagels on wooden boards (described earlier in directions).
  Place bagels on the boards bottom side up to form a crusty bottom,
  and flip them off the board after 2 or 3 minutes onto a stone or
  sheet to continue baking.
  
  Bake the bagels directly on a baking stone or tiles. Place the stone
  or tiles on the lowest rack. Or line a baking sheet with the tiles
  and place that on the lowest rack. Preheat the oven, with stone or
  tiles inside, to 400F. for 1 hour before baking. Sprinkle cornmeal on
  the stone or tiles. Transfer unbaked bagels to the hot surface with a
  wooden peel (a long-handled wooden paddle used in baking), or any
  flat instrument with a long handle so you don't burn yourself; wear
  heavy padded gloves.
  
  Do not wash or immerse stone or tiles in cold water while they are
  hot; they may crack. Soak the cooled stone or tiles in cold water and
  scrape with a spatula. Do not use soap, as the surfaces tend to
  absorb soap, which will be imparted to the bagels. Stones and tiles
  will discolor, but that won't affect their baking ability. Don't
  place a hot stone directly on your kitchen counter; depending on the
  material, the heat could leave a mark.
  
  Steam baking gives bagel tops a crisp crust and extra shine. Create
  steam during the first few seconds of the baking by spraying the
  sides of the preheated oven with water from a spray bottle when you
  place the bagels inside. Place a heavy pan in the lower part of the
  oven bottom while it is heating. Place the bagels in the oven and
  then pour cold water or half a dozen ice cubes into the pan.
  
  STORING AND USING BAGELS:
  
  Bagels are best when they're eaten fresh from the oven while still
  warm. Because they don't usually contain egg or milk, they tend to
  dry out faster than breads that contain these ingredients. If you
  can't consume all the bagels in a reasonably short time, freezing
  them is recommended. It's smart to slice them horizontally before
  freezing so you can toast only half at a time, if you wish.
  
  Thaw bagels on the kitchen counter in a plastic bag for about 15
  minutes or toast directly from the freezer. Or zap them in the
  microwave oven for about 1 minute on DEFROST and then toast them
  until lightly browned on top. Microwaving too long will make them
  tough.
  
  What if a few bagels get stale? Put them into your blender or food
  processor and grind them into bread crumbs. None of the tasty bread
  need ever go to waste!

  Subject: WHAT DID I DO WRONG?
  
  JC> This past Friday I made my first attempt in many years to
  barbecue JC> a rump roast. JC> I placed it on the spit over medium
  coals, using a meat JC> thermometer. It roasted for about 2 hours
  before reaching the JC> medium setting, at which time I removed it
  from the grill ... JC> When the meat was sliced the center was a nice
  medium pink. JC> The meat was tough as a piece of shoe leather.  What
  could I have JC> done wrong, or was it just a case of a bad piece of
  meat to begin JC> with?
  
  From:    Kathy Pitts
  
  Tough to tell long-distance, Jean, but I'd say the problem was too
  hot a fire.  Rump isn't the tenderest meat in the world to begin
  with, and if you subject it to too much heat too fast, the connective
  tissues are going to tighten up, forcing the moisture out, and
  resulting in a dry, tough hunk of cow.
  
  Next time, try roasting the meat in an pan, rather than the
  rotisserie, building your fire by making SMALL mounds of coals on
  either side of the roast (no heat directly below). If you like, you
  can place the roast directly on the grids of your grill, placing the
  pan in the center of the firebox to act as a buffer for the coals.
  
  Place a cover over the roast (if your grill doesn't have a cover, you
  can improvise one with some heavy wire and heavy-duty aluminum foil.)
  The heat from the coals should only result in an interior cooking
  temperature of 250-300 degrees.  If it goes down further, don't
  panic. Anything above 200 will cook the meat eventually, and the
  slower the better in this case.
  
  You also might try using a more acid marinade (wine, beer, lemon or
  lime juice in the marinade).  The acid will tenderize the meat
  somewhat (don't expect miracles, though).
  
  Good luck, and let us all know how the next one turns out.

  From:    Dave Sacerdote
  
  I've found the most common cause of a tough roast isn't the cut of
  meat or how you cook it, it's how you SLICE it.
  
  When you carve, make sure you're cutting across the grain of the
  meat. With a tied roast, this usually means that you have to change
  the angle of your cuts as you go along.
  
  As for the dryness:  I like to slightly undercook a roast when I do
  it on the grill's rotisserie.  The meat continues to cook for a few
  minutes after coming off the heat, as you know. Letting the roast
  rest for that time, like you did, usually gives it enough time to
  "finish off" without drying too much.  Remember that when you're
  rotisserie cooking, the fat side of the roast doesn't baste the meat
  nearly as much as a standing roast where the fat side stays on top
  throughout the whole time.

      Title: ABOUT CANNING
 Categories: Info, Canned, Jw
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Great care must be taken in canning to avoid spoilage. Non-acid foods
  require special care to avoid deadly botulism and require pressure
  cooking not just a boiling water bath.
  
  Check the elasticity of the sealing rubbers and discard cracked ones.
  Do not re-use old ones. Wash them in soap and hot water, rinse and
  place in a pan covering them with boiling water. Leave them soaking
  in the hot water until used.
  
  Check the jars for cracks and chips. Test the jars by filling with
  water and inverting; watch for leaks. Sterilize for 15 minutes in
  boiling water.
  
  Can only fresh, unblemished produce. Wash well to remove all dirt.
  Many foods require blanching to partially cook them and kill enzymes.
  Immerse in boiling water for 5 minutes, then plunge into cold water
  to arrest cooking. Tomatoes, berries and soft fruit do not need
  blanching. Meats should be 2/3 cooked by simmering or roasting.
  
  Add salt in the ratio of 1 tsp per quart for meats and vegetables Use
  a sugar syrup for fruits and add lemon juice or ascorbic acid to avoid
  discoloration. See "About Jams, jellies and preserves"
  
  Pack jars tightly to 1/2" from the top but do not crush the contents.
  Exception: peas, lima beans and corn need more room to expand; fill
  to 1" from the top and add boiling water to the 1/2" mark.
  
  Stir the contents to release trapped air bubbles before sealing the
  jars. Wet the rubber before using.
  
  Follow the manufacture's instructions that come with the pressure
  canner and add 1/2 lb pressure per 1000' in high altitudes. Use a
  boiling water bath only for tomatoes, acid fruits and brined
  vegetables. Use a rack to keep the jars off the bottom where they can
  overheat and crack. The water should be at least an inch over the
  jars at all times. Add 1 minute per 1000' feet for high altitudes.
  
  Store the finished product in a cool dark pantry or cellar. Berries,
  cherries and currants: Pack jars with washed, stemmed fruit and fill
  the jars with boiling medium syrup [3 cups sugar to 4 cups water
  brought slowly to a boil while stirring]. Process 15 minutes in a
  boiling water bath. [Cherries should either be pitted OR have their
  skins pierced with a pin if canned whole].
  
  Peaches: Scald to loosen skins. Peel and half, removing pits. Use
  medium syrup and process 20 min. in boiling water bath.
  
  Tomatoes: Scald and dip in cold water before skinning. Cut out cores
  but leave whole. Pack and fill jars with boiling water. Process 45

  Start with a thoroughly clean coffee maker. Wash after each use with
  hot, soapy water and rinse well with hot water; never scour with an
  abrasive pad. When cleaning an automatic coffee maker, follow the
  manufacturer's directions.
  
  Always use fresh coffee and freshly drawn cold water. Never use hot
  water, especially in automatic coffee makers; it changes percolating
  time.
  
  Serve steaming-hot coffee as soon as possible after brewing. If
  coffee must stand any length of time, remove grounds and hold coffee
  at serving temperature over very low heat.
  
  Keep ground coffee tightly covered.
  
  PREPARATION METHODS Automatic: Follow manufacturer's directions for
  selecting grind of coffee (special ones are available), measuring and
  brewing the coffee and holding the coffee at serving temperature.
  
  Drip: Measure cold water and heat to boiling. Preheat coffeepot by
  rinsing with very hot water. Measure drip-grind coffee into filter
  paper in cone or into filter section of coffee-pot depending on the
  type of drip pot used. Pour measured fresh boiling water into upper

  Blueberries freeze very well.  Simply sort the fruit, don't wash, and
  pack in freezer bags or boxes. When you use the frozen fruit, simply
  wash in running water and use. Don't thaw. This is especially nice
  when adding blueberries to fruit salad or muffins where you don't
  want the rest of the product to turn purple. If you've already washed
  the berries, let them dry before freezing. My favorite way to eat
  blueberries is "straight up." For breakfast try the berries in rice
  (brown, white, what ever) with a little cinnamon and/or clove.

      Title: ABOUT JAMS  JELLIES & PRESERVES
 Categories: Jam, Jelly, Fruits, Preserves
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  The less sugar you use the greater the flavor impact of the fruit. If
  honey is used there will be a flavor change and the jellies/jams must
  be cooked longer. If you use artificial sweeteners use only the
  Cyclamate type to avoid bitterness and follow the manufacturer's
  instructions. Cooked down jellies in which the juice is extracted by
  the open kettle method contain 60% fruit versus commercial products
  [pressure cooked to extract more juice but pectin destroying] with
  only 45%
  
  Jelly: has great clarity from dripping the cooked fruit through a
  cloth before adding sugar and finishing.
  
  Jams, Butter and Pastes: are whole fruit purees of increasing density.
  
  Marmalades, Preserves and Conserves: are bits of fruit in a heavy
  syrup.
  
  High Pectin Fruits: Apples, Crabapples, Quinces, Red Currants,
  Gooseberries, Plums and Cranberries. These need no additional pectin.
  If you get syrupy jelly you used too much sugar or did not cook the
  juice long enough after adding the sugar.
  
  Low Pectin Fruits: Strawberries, Blueberries, Peaches, Apricots,
  Cherries, Pears, Blackberries, Raspberries, Grapes, Pineapple and
  Rhubarb. These require combining with high pectin fruits or adding a
  commercial pectin.
  
  To Test Pectin Content: Put 1 tbl cooled fruit juice in a glass. Add
  an equal amount of grain alcohol and shake gently. The alcohol will
  bring the pectin together in a gel. If a large amount of pectin is
  present it will appear in a single mass or clot when poured from the
  glass. Use equal amounts of juice and sugar. If the pectin collects
  in several small particles use have as much sugar as juice.
  
  To sterilize jelly glasses: fill jars 3/4 full of water and place
  them in a shallow pan partly filled with water. Simmer 15 min and
  then keep hot until filled. If the lids are placed on the steaming
  jars they will be sterilized simultaneously.
  
  Tips: -Use enamel or stainless steel pots not aluminum or copper.
        -On average, use 3/4 c sugar to 1 c fruit or juice depending on
         pectin content[see above].
        -Very acid fruits can tolerate a whole c of sugar.
        -Sterilize jars and seal tightly.
        -For fruit that tends to discolor add lemon juice or Ascorbic
  acid.
        -Keep in a cool dark place but do not refrigerate.
  
  Making Jam: is easiest and most economical as it needs only one
  cooking step and uses the pulp. Measure the fruit. In putting it in
  the pan, crush the lower layers to provide moisture until more is
  drawn out by cooking or add a little water. Simmer the fruit until it
  is soft. Add sugar and stir until dissolved. Bring to a boil,
  stirring to avoid sticking. Reduce heat and cook until thickened- up
  to 1/2 hr.
  
  Making Preserves and Conserves: Place fruit in a pot with an equal
  amount of sugar in layers ending with sugar on top and allow to rest
  overnight. Bring slowly to a boil and simmer until fruit is
  translucent. Drain fruit and put in sterile jars. Simmer syrup longer
  if necessary to thicken it and pour over fruit. Seal and store.
  
  Making juice for jelly: Wash and drain fruit. Prick or crush the
  fruit. Add water if fruit is not juicy enough eg. apples. Add enough
  to the kettle that you can see it through the fruit but the fruit is
  not floating. Cook uncovered until the fruit is soft and loosing its
  color. Have ready a jelly bag [several layers of cheese cloth] . Wet
  it, wring it out and line a strainer with it. Let the juice drip
  through without squeezing it as this muddies and flavors the jelly.
  This juice can be kept up to 6 months before proceeding by freezing
  or canning it.
  
  Making jelly: Measure the strained juice and put it in an enamel or
  stainless steel pan. Simmer 5 min. Skim off froth. Measure and warm
  sugar in a pan in the oven and add it. Stir until dissolved. Cook at
  a gentle simmer until the point of jelling. To test, place a small
  amount of jelly on a spoon, cool it slightly and let it drop back
  into the pot from the side of the spoon. As the syrup thickens, 2
  large drops will form along the edge of the spoon. when these two
  drops run together and fall as a single drop the "sheeting" stage has
  been reached- 220 to 222 deg F and the jelly will be firm when
  cooled. It can take anywhere from 10 to 30 min for jelly to reach
  this stage depending on the fruit and the amount of sugar. Take the
  jars from the sterilizing bath and invert on a cake cooler. They
  should be hot but dry when filled. Fill to 1/4" from the top. Cover
  with melted paraffin 1/8" deep.

           Milkweed buds
           ;Boiling water
           Butter; to taste
 
  Unopened buds are delicious when cooked but must be treated first to

  one minute, drain, and pour on more boiling water. Repeat this
  process three times or until no bitterness remains when you taste
  them. Cook them a little longer until just tender and serve with
  butter.
  
  Reader Jean McLain of Peoria, IL wrote "The Herb Companion" and
  asked: "Any ideas what can be done to use milkweed blossoms? The
  fragrance is musky but not unpleasant. Could they be used in
  moth-repellant bags?" HC responded with the above recipe and said
  they could find no mention of any use of the blossoms as a moth
  repellent.

      Title: ABOUT MISO
 Categories: Text file, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Text file
 
  The best resource on Miso that I know of is Shurtleff and Aoyagi's
  book _The Book of Miso_.  It's quite a complex subject. The
  differences is miso can be attributed to a variet of factors, from
  the proportion of ingredients, cooking techniques, and duration and
  temperature of fermentation.  The redish color comes from long
  fermentation times (or in cheap imitations, from dyes). The whiter
  misos are generally fermented for short times, and often made with
  rice in addition to soybeans. Reds are generally saltier and whites
  sweeter.
  
  Misos vary widely in fat content (like most soy products) and
  generally range from .25 to 1.5 gram of fat per tablespoon (and from
  about 6%CFF to over 30%CFF). Some varieties, like peanut miso,
  obviously have even more fat.  Since it is rare that a dish has more
  than 1 T miso per serving, miso does not generally add appreciable
  fat to a dish. Many of the white sweet misos clock in at the low end
  (.25 grams per T, 6-10%CFF) so if you do want to use more miso, these
  kinds can be added liberally to a dish (and since their taste isn't
  as strong or salty, they do become many dishes in greater quantity).
  
  I find the dark, hearty misos make great gravy starters. Add a bit of
  water/stock, some nutritional yeast, spices and a thickener to some
  miso and voila, instant delicious gravy. A favorite miso-potato
  recipe follows.
  
  ~- Michelle Dick artemis@rahul.net
  
  On miso, you just have to try different kinds & brands. There are
  numerous styles of miso.  Red misos tend to be more "savory" and
  white ones are usually more "sweet". Country-style (Inaka) is made
  grainier on purpose. If served as a sauce on veggies, probably it's
  not straight miso but mixed w/sugar and some rice vinegar. BTW a
  warning to vegetarians, some misos come "dashi-iri" which includes
  fish-based stock.  I think the ingredients label in English will
  mention fish, but not sure (since I can read the Japanese, I don't
  usually check the English), so check the ingredients carefully.
  There is kombu-dashi (I even found some granulated packets) which is
  vegetarian, but most dashi is from bonito flakes (I guess it must be
  cheaper).

      Title: ABOUT MOLE
 Categories: Info, Mexican
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Mole (pron. mole-a) is a series of Mexican sauces that contain ground
  chiles, spices, nuts, often chocolate, sometimes raisins, ground
  seeds, etc.
  
  There are three basic types of moles:
  
  1.  Mole Poblano (the most famous type, and the one that ALWAYS
  contains chocolate) was originated in Pueblo during Colonial times
  (Mexican colonial, not ours) by the nuns who wanted to make a special
  dish for a visiting Archbishop.  The sauce contains ground dried
  chile peppers, ground nuts, ground raisins, broth, chocolate,
  sometimes ground corn tortillas, a small amount of sugar, and various
  spices. It is traditionally served over turkey, with a side dish of
  unfilled tamales (just the cornmeal masa steamed in corn shucks.)
  It's one of those dishes that rarely finds its way out of the country
  of origin, and you either passionately love or passionately hate. I'd
  post a recipe if I could find one (Have recipes for all three
  versions floating around SOMEWHERE, but never got the time to enter
  'em into the computer, so they're a little tough to find). It may
  also be purchased pre-made (something I recommend, as the bottled
  version is excellent, and this is NOT something you'd want to attack
  from scratch on even a semi-regular basis). If Shirley is interested,
  I'll pick up a jar and ship it your way.
  
  2.  Mole Verde (green mole) contains green chiles, broth, ground
  pumpkin seeds, various herbs and spices. It's usually served over
  chicken or pork. Nice stuff, and much easier for the beginner to like
  than the Mole Poblano.
  
  3.  Mole Roja (red mole) is a sauce that contains red chiles, herbs
  and spices, ground nuts or seeds, ground corn tortillas, usually no
  chocolate. I THINK it comes from the region around Oxaca. Again, it's
  marginally easier to like than the more well-known version. It's
  usually served over chicken or pork.
  
  All of these dishes are virtual throwbacks to the complex (and to our
  palates unusual) combinations of ingredients that were common in that
  part of the country before the arrival of the Spaniards. None of the
  dishes is particularly hot, they have a complex, haunting flavor that
  speaks of cultures long gone, but not entirely forgotten.
  
  Don't know if you'd like 'em or not, Unka Burt (I do), but if you
  want just a hint of what I'm talking about, throw a square of
  unsweetened chocolate in your next batch of Left-Handed Chili, and
  let us know what you think.

      Title: ABOUT PICKLING
 Categories: Info, Pickles, Joy, Jw
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Although many vitamins and minerals are leached away in the process,
  pickles remain popular as piquant side dishes and relishes long after
  more efficient food preservation techniques such as refrigeration,
  freezing and canning surplanted this pioneer mainstay as a primary
  food storage method.
  
  Short Brine Pickling:
  
  In this process the vegetables are soaked in brine 24 hours to draw
  out moisture but they are not fermented. To keep, they must have
  boiling hot vinegar poured over them which penetrates and preserves
  as well as crisping them. The final step after jarring and sealing is
  a 15 minute boiling water bath to kill any enzymes. If pickles show
  evidence of fermentation after being stored away [bubbles or leakage]
  either discard or immediately re-pickle.
  
  Because of the acids involved use stoneware, pottery, glass and
  enamel or stainless steel kettles. For stirring and transferring use
  a long handled stainless or wooden slotted spoon. Make sure all
  equipment is clean and grease free. Pickles should be stored in
  sterilized glass jars with glass lids. For sterilizing techniques,
  refer to "About Jams, Jellies and Preserves". [Posted by me last week]
  
  Fruits and vegetables should be very fresh, in prime condition without
  blemishes or bruises and scrubbed dirt free.
  
  Garlic should be blanched 2 minutes before adding or removed before
  jarring.
  
  Spices should be whole not ground and in a removable spice bag.
  
  Water should be low iron, low sulphur and soft. It can be softened
  with up to 1 tablespoon calcium oxide [lime] per quart. If your water
  supply is inadequate buy distilled water or collect rain water.
  
  Salt should be additive free Pickling salt. Regular table salt will
  cloud the liquid.
  
  Vinegar should be 6% acetic acid. Use white distilled vinegar not
  cider, wine or flavored vinegars.
  
  Lime water or cherry and grape leaves in the liquid will make pickles
  crisp. Use alum sparingly if at all and do not use the Copper Sulfate
  called for in old fashioned recipes as it is mildly poisonous in
  excessive amounts.
  
  Pickles should be stored at least 6 weeks to achieve maximum flavor
  and although they will keep for years should be consumed within one
  year as the flavor will deteriorate over time.
  
  This is based on extracts from the Joy of Cooking with amendments and
  additions by Jim Weller.

      Title: ABOUT PORK CHOPS
 Categories: Pork, Info
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  SS> But I don't even bother buying pork chops any more, I don't want
  SS> to put leather on the table.  :(
  
  Don't know if you caught my post to Marlon or not, Sylvia, but the
  problem is not with you, it's with the pork. Now that pork producers
  are looking for a leaner, lighter product, pork requires much less
  cooking than is recommended in most cookbooks.  Most cookbook authors
  recommend cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160-175 to
  eliminate any possible danger of trichinosis (a problem that's been
  eliminated in commercially produced pork anyway). These temperatures
  are WAY too high for the leaner version, which tends to resemble shoe
  leather if treated this way. Try cooking your chops to an internal
  temperature of 140 or so instead (still well done, but not
  overcooked), and you'll have MUCH better results.
  
  My favorite thing to do with pork chops is to stuff 'em. Allow one
  double-thick pork chop or two thinner chops for each person you're
  feeding.
  
  Make a stuffing with cornbread (or one of the cornbread stuffing
  mixes), chopped onion, chopped celery, a small can of whole kernal
  corn, a bit of chicken broth.  Simmer the onion and celery in the
  broth until tender, and add the remaining ingredients. Season to
  taste with salt, black pepper, a generous amount of either sage or
  thyme.
  
  If using double-thick chops, cut a deep pocket in the chop, and
  insert the stuffing.  If using thinner chops, don't stuff yet. Either
  way, melt a small amount of shortening in a frying pan, and quickly
  brown the chops (brown thinner chops on one side only).
  
  Place the chops in an oven-proof baking dish.  (If using thin chops,
  place one chop, browned side down in the dish, top with a scoop of
  stuffing, and top with another chop, browned side up).
  
  Place just enough liquid in the pan to cover the pan bottom, cover
  the pan, and bake in a 350 degree oven until the chops reach an
  internal temperature of 140 (35-60 minutes, depending on the
  thickness of the meat).
  
  Any leftover stuffing can be baked separately.
  
  I usually make a pan gravy with the drippings from browning the
  chops, plus some flour and chicken broth (pork stock would be better,
  but I never seem to have any
  :-).  If you don't want gravy, just deglaze the baking dish with more
  chicken stock, and spoon this liquid over the chops.
  
  Sorry not to offer an official recipe here, but this is one of those
  home-style dishes that I just throw together. Have never measured
  anything for it, and I suspect it's never QUITE the same any time I
  make it. Good stuff, though.  At least it's one of Mooseface's
  favorites :-)

 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Info/tips
 
 
  "Some of the most common kinds of pulses used in Indian cooking are as
  follows:
  
  Chana dal (or gram dal) are hulled and split chick-peas. Deep yellow
  in color, these pulses do not need soaking before cooking."
  
  "Kabli chana are yellow chick-peas. Unhulled and beige in color, they
  need overnight soaking before cooking.
  
  "Kala chana are small brown or black chick-peas. Like kabli chana,
  they require long presoaking and cooking to become tender.
  
  "Continental masoor are whole greenish-brown lentils. Flat and
  oval-shaped, they originated in the West and were adopted by India,
  so they should already be fairly familiar to you. They do not need
  presoaking."
  
  "Masoor are brown Indian lentils. Whole but smaller than continental
  masoor, they do not require presoaking.
  
  "Masoor dal are split masoor which are tiny and salmon-pink because
  they have also been hulled. They do not need presoaking and turn
  yellow when they cook.
  
  "Moong beans (or hari dal) are dark green, small, and slightly
  cylindrical in shape. They need 2-4 hours' soaking before cooking,
  but if oversoaked they will sprout and become moong bean sprouts so
  familiar in the West."
  
  "Moong dal chilka are split moong beans, green on one side and pale
  on the other. They do not need presoaking.
  
  "Moong dal are split, light yellow, and rectangular in shape because
  they are hulled. They do not need to be soaked before cooking.
  
  "Toor dal (or arhar dal) are a hulled, split pulse, a little larger
  than chana dal. Dull and yellow-colored, they do need presoaking."
  
  "Urid (or black matpe) are small, dull, and black, similar in size and
  shape to moong beans. They must be presoaked.
  
  "Urid dal are split urid that do not need to be soaked before cooking.
  
  "Washed urid dal are off-white because they have been hulled and
  washed as well as split. They do not require presoaking."

      Title: ABOUT QUICK BREADS
 Categories: Breads, Crocker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See Below
 
  As their name suggests, quick breads are just that-fast and very easy
  to make. Quick breads range from pancakes to tender, flaky biscuits
  to moist, rich nut breads.
  
  Quick-acting baking powder rather than slower-acting yeast is the
  leavening agent for quick breads. It consists of an acid, such as
  cream of tartar, and an alkali, such as baking soda, which react with
  one another in the presence of moisture to form a gas. In batter or
  dough this gas forms tiny bubbles that expand quickly, creating the
  structure of the quick bread. To be sure it is always fresh, purchase
  only a small quantity of baking powder at a time.
  
  BAKING TIPS
  
  Use shiny pans and cookie sheets, which reflect heat, for golden,
  delicate and tender crusts on muffins, coffee cakes and nut breads.
  
  Grease only the bottoms of muffin cups; muffins will then be nicely
  shaped and have no rim around the top edge.
  
  Grease only the bottoms of loafpans for fruit or nut breads. The
  ungreased sides provide a surface for the batter to cling to while
  rising during baking, which helps form a gently rounded top.
  
  Cool nut breads completely before slicing to prevent crumbling. Cut
  with a sharp, thin-bladed knife, using a light sawing motion.

      Title: ABOUT RED MULBERRY
 Categories: Info, Fruits, Jw
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  How to Recognize: The only mulberry native to Canada, it is a short-
  trunked deciduous tree under 30 feet in height. The bark is reddish
  brown, separating in long, flaky plates. The yellowish green leaf
  blades are large, up to 5" long, widest below the middle and have
  hairy undersides. They are simple with pointed tips and the stems are
  long with 3 prominent veins at the base of each leaf. Male and female
  flowers are borne in separate clusters appearing with or before the
  first leaves. The fruits are dark red to black compact aggregates
  which resemble blackberries.
  
  White mulberry is an Asian tree whose foliage is used for silkworm
  feed and has been introduced as an ornamental and is an escapee
  throughout eastern North America. It has lustrous smooth leaves and
  whitish or reddish fruit.
  
  Where to Find: Southernmost Ontario in moist, rich soils often mixed
  with other hardwoods.
  
  How to Use: Harvest easily by spreading sheets under the tree and
  shaking the branches gently. Juicy and sweet when ripe; delicious
  raw, in fruit beverages, or in baked desserts. Alone or in
  combination with acid fruits such as gooseberries or cherries. Can be
  frozen or dried like raisins. Use as in blackberry and raspberry
  recipes.
  
  WARNING: Be careful not to eat raw fruit before it is ripe. Unripe
  fruit and the milky sap in the leaves and stems are toxic and can
  cause gastric upsets. The leaves and stems may also cause dermatitis
  if touched by susceptible individuals. From: Edible Wild Fruits and

      Title: ABOUT SHRIMP
 Categories: Shellfish, Info
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  If I may, I'd like to give you some unsolicited advice on handling
  your shrimp.  The better it's treated, the better it's going to taste
  in the end.
  
  1.  Only defrost the quantity you're going to use at any one time (I'm
  hoping here that the shrimp arrived frozen in manageable blocks. If
  not, place it in your refrigerator until it's thawed enough to
  portion, but still icy and essentially frozen.  Portion and re-freeze
  what you're not going to use immediately).
  
  2.  Thaw the shrimp in the refrigerator or in a bucket, by running
  COLD running water over it. If you use the cold water method, allow
  the water to run over the top of the bucket and into the sink, to
  ensure a constant supply of fresh water (the temperature of the
  thawing water should never exceed 70 degrees, and the temperature of
  the thawed shrimp should never exceed 40 degrees.) If your tap water
  is hotter, add ice to the thawing shrimp.  If the shrimp exceeds 40
  degrees, place it in a bath of half ice and half COLD water, and
  refrigerate until it comes down to below 40. Store thawed shrimp
  under refrigeration in a mixture of half shrimp, half ice.
  
  3.  To peel, devein your shrimp, go to your local seafood market or
  gadget center, and pick up a nifty little gadget called a
  "shrimptool". It will cost a couple of dollars, and for the quantity
  of shrimp we're talking about here, it's worth it.
  
  4.  If you want to peel/devein the shrimp for a recipe, keep the
  unpeeled shrimp on ice as you work with it. Do not let the
  temperature exceed 40 degrees.  Drop your peeled, deveined shrimp
  into an ice water bath until you're ready to use it.  Peeled deveined
  shrimp may be held this way for up to 24 hours without much loss in
  flavor/texture.
  
  This seems like a lot of trouble, but shrimp begins to lose
  flavor/texture almost immediately once it gets the least bit warm.
  Health/safety questions aside, the ice method, while troublesome,
  results in a MUCH better tasting end product.
  
  One other tip -- the iodine in the shrimp will be irritating to your
  hands, if you handle a large quantity at a time. To avoid this, soak
  your hands in a strong solution of baking soda and water after
  working with large amounts.
  
  Finally, a quick recipe for fried shrimp that we enjoy:
  
  Go to the store and purchase a package of tempura batter mix. Make
  the mix according to package directions, substituting cold beer (or
  cold club soda, if you prefer to avoid alcohol) for the water called
  for in the recipe.
  
  Dip butterflied peeled, deveined shrimp in the batter, and fry in hot
  deep fat until light gold (it won't and shouldn't get deep brown).
  
  The leftover batter makes unbelievable onion rings.

      Title: ABOUT TEA
 Categories: Beverages, Crocker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See Below
 
  The tea you buy is a delicate blend of some 20 to 30 varieties.
  Quality varies according to the soil, climate and altitude in which
  it is grown and the age and size of the leaves when they are picked.
  
  Broadly classified, there are three types: black, oolong and green.
  
  Black tea derives its color from a special processing treatment in
  which the leaves are allowed to oxidize. This turns the leaves black
  and produces a rich brew.
  
  Oolong tea is semioxidized. Its leaves are brown and green. It brews
  light in color.
  
  Green tea is not oxidized, thus the leaves remain green. The brew is
  pale green in color.
  
  PREPARATION METHOD Whether you use loose tea or tea bags, the
  preparation method is the same:
  
  Start with a spotlessly clean teapot made of glass, china or
  earthenware. Add rapidly boiling water; allow to stand a few minutes,
  then pour out.
  
  Heat cold water to a full rolling boil.
  
  Add tea or bags to the warm pot, allowing 1 teaspoon of loose tea or
  1 tea bag for each cup of tea desired. Pour boiling water over tea
  (3/4 cup for each cup of tea); let stand 3 to 5 minutes to bring out
  the full flavor. Stir the tea once to ensure uniform strength.
  
  Do not judge the strength of tea by its color; You must taste it.
  
  Strain the tea or remove tea bags. Serve with sugar and milk or lemon
  if desired.
  
  Prepare instant tea, a concentrate, according to the directions on
  the jar.

      Title: ABOUT VANILLA BEANS
 Categories: Information, Vanilla
      Yield: 1 Info file
 
           Information only
 
  Information from the 1996 Old Farmer's Almanac, "What You Can Eat To
  Achieve True Peace of Mind", by Ken Haedrich
  
  The vanilla orchid is a member of the plant family known as
  Orchidaceae and is the only orchid that produces edible fruit. The
  beans grow on a thick vine that flourishes in warm, moist climates
  within 25 degrees of the equator.  The vanilla plant begins to bear
  fruit when it is three or four years old.  Eight to nine months after
  pollination, the beans are golden yellow and ready for harvest and
  curing.
  
  It takes about five to six pounds of green, freshly picked vanilla
  beans to make one pound of properly cured beans. There are basically
  two ways to cure the beans: in the sun or over a fire. Using the
  solar method, beans are spread in the hot sun by day and wrapped in
  blankets and placed in wooden boxes by night. The sweating process is
  repeated over and over for six months, until the beans have lost up
  to 80 percent of their moisture content.  This method produces
  superior results and is used in Madascar, Mexico, the former Bourbon
  Islands, Tonga, and Tahiti.
  
  The wood-fire curing method, used in Indonesia and Bali, takes only
  two or three weeks, but produces a dry, brittle bean with a smoky
  flavor, generally considered inferior.
  
  When you buy a vanilla bean at your market, the black, oily, smooth
  pod you're buying is a cured bean.  When you purchase a bottle of
  pure vanilla extract, you're buying beans whose flavor components
  have been dissolved in a solution of water and alcohol.  By law, pure
  vanilla extract must contain at least 35 percent alcohol by volume.
  Anything less is labeled a flavor. Pure vanilla extracts come in a
  variety of folds, or strengths. The Food and Drug Administration has
  established that a fold of vanilla is the extractive matter of 13.35
  ounces of vanilla beans to a gallon of liquid. Strong, pure extracts,
  such as four-fold, are primarily used in mass food production.
  
  What about imitation vanilla? ~----------------------------
  
  Not only is pure vanilla expensive, but demand also far exceeds the
  world's supply of the real thing. Stepping in to fill the void is the
  chemist, who has come up with a variety of imitations made from
  synthetic vanillin, the organic component that gives vanilla its
  distinctive flavor and fragrance. Most synthetic vanillin is a
  byproduct of the paper industry, made by cooking and treating
  wood-pulp effluent. But since vanillin is only one of more than 150
  flavor and fragrance compounds found in pure vanilla, the chemist has
  yet to match the subtlety with which Mother Nature has endowed the
  real thing.
  
  How to tell a good bean when you see one.
  ~----------------------------------------
  
  Quality is key.  To truly experience all the flavor and fragrance
  vanilla has to offer, you have to seek out quality beans and
  extracts. Generally speaking, look for beans that are supple and
  aromatic. Tahitian beans are moister and relatively short and plump,
  with thin skins and a floral aroma. Bourbon beans (so called because
  they originate in Madagascar, Reunion, and the Comoros, formerly
  known as the Bourbon Islands) are slightly dryer, contain more
  natural vanillin, and have thick skins (the flavor has nothing to do
  with bourbon whiskey.) Stay away from dry, brittle, or smoky-smelling
  beans.  Depending upon quality and variety, single vanilla beans
  retail from about $1.50 to $10 apiece. Vanilla beans should be kept
  at room temperature in an airtight container. Don't refrigerate them
  or they may develop mold. Vanilla beans last up to two years.
  
  Especially if you cook with it often, it is more economical to buy
  pure vanilla extract by the pint, or even the quart, and share it
  with a friend. The best pure extracts contain no caramel and
  artificial color and little or no sugar.  Store extract at room
  temperature, tightly closed. It will keep up to five years.

      Title: ABOUT YEAST BREADS - BAKING TIPS
 Categories: Info, Crocker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See Below
 
  Use loaf pans of anodized aluminum, darkened metal glass for bread
  with well-browned crusts.
  
  Shiny cookie sheets or muffin cups produce sweet rolls u tender,
  golden brown crusts.
  
  Stagger loaf pans on a lower shelf of the oven so they do not touch
  sides of the oven or each other.
  
  The top of each pan should be level with, or slightly above, the
  middle of the oven.
  
  If baking round loaves on a cookie sheet, place the sheet on the
  center rack.
  
  Doneness is determined by tapping the crust. The loaf will have a
  hollow sound when done.
  
  Remove loaves from pans immediately and place on wire racks away from
  draft. to cool.
  
  For a shiny, soft crust, brush just-baked loaf with margarine, butter
  or shortening.
  
  STORING Bread and rolls can be stored in airtight containers in a
  cool dry place for 5 to 7 days. Refrigerate only in hot, humid
  weather. Breads can be stored, tightly wrapped in moistureproof or
  vaporproof material, labeled and dated, in the freezer for 2 to 3
  months. To thaw, let stand wrapped at room temperature for 2 to 3
  hours.

 Categories: Crocker, Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        1 x  See Below
  
  Flour: All-purpose flour is the most widely used flour. It contains a
  special protein called gluten the structure builder of bread. When
  mixed with liquid and kneaded or beaten, the gluten stretches and
  gives elasticity to the dough by trapping bubbles of gas formed by
  the yeast. Some flours, such as rye and whole wheat, lack sufficient
  gluten and usually are used in combination with all-purpose flour.
  Self rising flour, which already contains leavening and salt, is not
  often recommended for yeast breads. However, all recipes were tested
  with self rising flour; adjustments are indicated when necessary.
  
  Yeast: Yeast is a live plant that gives off a gas that makes dough
  rise: It is very sensitive-too much heat will kill it, but cold will
  stunt its growth. Yeast is available in several forms: regular active
  dry yeast, quick-acting active dry yeast and compressed yeast. All of
  our recipes have been tested with dry yeast. Most of the recipes
  follow the traditional method of dissolving the yeast in warm water
  (105 to 115F). However, some recipes yield better results by mixing
  the yeast with the flour, then beating in very warm water (120 to
  130F).
  
  Liquids: Water or milk are the most commonly used liquids. Water gives
  bread a crisper crust; milk, a velvety texture and added nutrients.
  
  Sweeteners: Sugar, honey or molasses provide "food" for the yeast,
  enhance flavor and help brown the crust.
  
  Salt: A flavor agent that is needed to control the growth of the
  yeast and prevent overrising, which can cause the bread to collapse.
  
  Fat: Added to contribute to tenderness and flavor.
  
  Eggs: For flavor, richness and color, eggs are sometimes added.

      Title: ABOUT YEAST BREADS - YEAST DOUGHS
 Categories: Crocker, Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        1 x  See Below
  
  There are basically two kinds of yeast doughs-kneaded and batter. Both
  doughs need to rise before shaping and baking. To let dough rise,
  cover and keep in a warm, draft-free place. If necessary, place
  covered bowl of dough on wire rack over a bowl of warm water.
  
  Kneaded dough: Kneading develops the gluten and results in bread with
  an even texture and a smooth, nicely rounded top.
  
  After first addition of flour has been beaten in, dough will be very
  soft and will fall in "sheets" off rubber spatula.
  
  The second addition of flour makes the dough stiff enough to knead.
  Mix in only enough flour so dough leaves side of the bowl.
  
  To knead, fold dough toward you. With heels of hands, push dough away
  with short rocking motions. Give dough a quarter turn; repeat.
  
  When dough is properly kneaded, it will feel elastic and the top will
  be smooth with some blisters appearing on the surface.
  
  Dough should rise until double. Test by pressing fingertips 1/2 inch
  into dough. If impression remains, dough has risen enough.
  
  Punch down center of dough with your fist. Fold dough over and form
  into a ball. This releases large air bubbles to produce a finer
  texture.
  
  If dough is not sufficiently kneaded, the bread will be coarse, heavy,
  crumbly and dry.
  
  Batter dough: Batter breads are really shortcut no-knead yeast breads.
  Because less flour is used, the dough is stickier; instead of being
  kneaded, it is beaten with a mixer with the first addition of flour.
  The batter is generally not shaped but spread in the pan. The bread
  has a coarser texture and pebbled surface.
  
  REFRIGERATING YEAST DOUGH Yeast dough made with water (except. plain
  bread dough) can be refrigerated up to 5 days. However, if milk and
  at least 1/4 cup sugar are used, refrigerate no longer than 3 days.
  After mixing dough, grease top well. Cover with moistureproof wrap,
  then a damp cloth. Keep cloth damp during storage. When ready to
  bake, shape dough; let rise until double, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Bake as
  directed. Source: Betty Crocker's Cookbook, 6th Edition

      Title: ABRAYSHAM KABAUB ( SILK KEBAB)
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Water
      1 ts Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Saffron threads (optional)

MMMMM---------------------------OMELET--------------------------------
      8    Eggs
      1 pn Salt

MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
      2 c  Oil
    3/4 c  Finely chopped pistachios *
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
 
  *Note: Instead of pistachio nuts, walnuts may be used if desired.
  Dissolve sugar in water in heavy pan over medium heat. Bring to the
  boil, add lemon juice and saffron and boil for 10 minutes. Cool and
  strain into a 25 cm (10 inch) pie plate.  Keep aside. Break eggs into
  a casserole dish about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter. The size and
  flat base are important. Add salt and mix eggs with fork until yolks
  and whites are thoroughly combined - do not beat as eggs must not be
  foamy. Heat oil in an electric frypan to 190 C (375 F) or in a 25 cm
  (10 inch) frypan placed on a thermostatically controlled hot plate or
  burner. Have ready nearby a long skewer, the plate of syrup, a baking
  sheet and the nuts mixed with the cardamom. A bowl of water and a
  cloth for drying hands are also necessary. Hold dish with eggs in one
  hand next to the pan of oil and slightly above it. Put hand into egg,
  palm down, so that egg covers back of hand. Lift out hand, curling
  fingers slightly inwards, then open out over hot oil, fingers
  pointing down.  Move hand across surface of oil so that egg falls in
  streams from fingertips.  Dip hand in egg again and make more strands
  across those already in pan.  Repeat 3 to 4 times until about an
  eighth of the egg is used.  There should be a closely meshed layer of
  egg strands about 20 cm (8 inches) across.  Work quickly so that the
  last lot of egg is added not long after the first lot. Rinse hands
  quickly and dry. Take skewer and slide under bubbling omelet, lift up
  and turn over to lightly brown other side. The first side will be
  bubbly, the underside somewhat smoother. When golden brown lift out
  with skewer and drain over pan. Place omelet flat in the syrup, spoon
  syrup over the top and lift out with skewer onto baking sheet. Roll
  up with bubbly side inwards. Finish roll should be about 3 cm (1 1/4
  inches) in diameter.  Put to one side and sprinkle with nuts. Repeat
  with remaining egg, making 7 to 8 rolls in all. Though depth of egg
  diminishes, you will become so adept that somehow you will get it in
  the pan in fine strands. When cool, cut kabaubs into 4-5 cm (1 1/2 to
  2 inch pieces and serve. These keep well in a sealed container in a
  cool place.

      Title: ABSOLUTELY APRICOT
 Categories: Abm, Fruits, Misc
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      3 ts Yeast; (active dry)
      3 c  Bread Flour
      2 tb Dry milk
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Apricot Jam
    3/4 c  Dried Apricots; chopped
  1 1/4 c  -Water
 
  If your machine offers the option, use the "light crust" setting as
  the crust browns more due to the sugar content of the jam. Try to use
  a jam with a high fruit content & few additives. This recipe can be
  baked on the regular, rapid bake, or timed settings. I have a DAK
  Turbo II & baked it on the reg setting.  It was one of the few loaves
  that have turned out really well lately...think my DAK is dying; just
  today ordered a ZOJI from Irwin. The bread kept VERY well in a
  Rubbermaid container...was nice & fresh for a whole week (I forgot
  about the last couple of slices!). I even made it when MY
  mother-in-law came to visit & she LOVED it! Hope it turns out good
  for you.

 Categories: Cookies, Chocolate, Low-fat/low
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
  7 1/2 oz All-purpose flour
      2 oz Cocoa Powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
      8 oz Chocolate -- broken in 16
           Pcs
      4 oz Unsweetened Chocolate --
           Broken in 8 pcs
     12 oz Light Brown Sugar
      6 oz Unsalted Butter
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 lb Chocolate Chips
 
  [Note: Instead of the unsweetened chocolate, I just used an extra
  4ozs of plain chocolate, and got perfect results. I think as long as
  you're using *really* good plain chocolate, say at least 55% cocoa
  solids, it doesn't really matter!]
  
  Preheat the oven to 325F / 170C / Gas 3.
  
  Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt.
  Set aside.
  
  Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
  heat. Place the plain and the unsweetened chocolates in the top half
  of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with cling film and allow
  to heat for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until
  smooth. Keep at room temperature until needed.
  
  Place the soft light brown sugar and butter in the bowl of an electric
  mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium for 1 minute. Scrape down
  the bowl and beat on high for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down
  the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, while beating on medium, and
  stopping to scrape down the bowl after incorporating each addition.
  Add the vanilla essence and beat on medium for 30 seconds. Add the
  melted chocolate and beat on low for 10 seconds more. Scrape down the
  bowl and beat for an additional 30 seconds. Add the sifted flour,
  cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt, and the chocolate chips,
  and beat on low until thoroughly combined - about 20 to 30 seconds.
  Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix thoroughly with a rubber
  spatula.
  
  Portion 6 to 8 biscuits per baking sheet by dropping 2 level
  tablespoons of batter per biscuit onto each of 2 non-stick baking
  sheets. Place the biscuits on the top and middle shelves of the
  preheated oven and bake for 18 to 22 minutes, rotating the sheets
  from top to bottom about halfway through the baking time. Allow the
  biscuits to cool for 5 to 6 minutes on the baking sheets. Transfer
  the biscuits to a cooling rack to thoroughly cool before storing in a
  sealed plastic container. Repeat this
  
  procedure until all the biscuits have been baked.
  
  Makes 3 to 3.  5 dozen biscuits

           -Japanese chile
      1    Bay leaves

MMMMM--------------------HEAT SCALE - MEDIUM-------------------------
 
    Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive heavy saucepan, allow to
  steep for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Bring mixture to a low
  and gentle boil while stirring continuously. Remove saucepan from
  heat and allow to cool thoroughly. Strain through a very fine sieve
  and pour the strained oil into a bottle and cap tightly. This oil
  will remain up to 6 months if it is refrigerated and capped tightly.
  This is a MEDIUM HOT condiment.
    This oil is used both to color and to flavor dishes. Use it in
  place of vegetable oil for South American recipes. Use only annatto
  (achiote) seeds that are bright-reddish in color; seeds that are
  brownish are old and have probably lost much of their flavor.

    1/2 c  Annatto seeds
 
    Heat the oil in a small saucepan, add the seeds and cook over low
  heat for about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time, until a rich
  orange color is obtained. Cool, strain and store in a covered jar in
  the refrigerator. It will keep for several months.
    If the seeds are cooked too long, the orange color will change to a
  golden color and much of the flavor is lost. Very stale seeds will
  give off all their color in one minute of cooking. Watch the saucepan
  carefully and remove it from the heat immediately the color begins to
  lighten.

      Title: ACORN SQUASH & WILD RICE
 Categories: Squash, Rice
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Acorn squash, ~1-1/2 lb ea
    1/2 lb Small Brussels sprouts
      2 ts Olive oil
      1 c  Diced onion
      1 ts Fennel seeds
      1 ts Dried marjoram
    1/4 c  Minced fresh sage
    1/4 c  Fresh orange juice
      2 ts Fresh lemon juice
    1/8 ts Freshly grated pepper
      2 c  Cooked wild rice
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).
  
  2.  Cut each squash in half and remove the seeds and pulp. In a large
  baking dish, place the squash, cut side down, with about 1 inch of
  water. Bake until tender, about 45 minutes.
  
  3.  Pour about 2 inches of water into a large stockpot. Place a
  collapsible steamer in the pot, cover, and bring to a boil. Place the
  Brussels sprouts in the steamer, cover, and steam for 5 to 7 minutes,
  or until tender. Set aside.
  
  4.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over low heat. Add the
  onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the
  fennel, marjoram, sage, orange juice, lemon juice, and pepper, and
  simmer for 3 minutes.  Stir in the cooked wild rice and the Brussels
  sprouts and heat through.
  
  5.  Spoon the wild rice and Brussels sprout mixture into the squash
  cavities.  Serve immediately.
  
  I often microwave the acorn squash by placing in a shallow glass pan
  with about 1/2-inch of water, covering with saran wrap and nuking for
  about 10 minutes or until tender.

  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the squash in half lengthwise,
  scrape out the seeds, place cut side down on a baking sheet and bake
  until soft, about 1 hour.
  
  When cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh into a mixing bowl
  and mash well. Add the tofu and blend thoroughly. In another bowl
  beat the egg and egg whites lightly, then add the squash mixture,
  spices, honey pepper, and butter. Mix well.
  
  Turn the puree into a shallow 1 quart baking dish. If preparing ahead
  to this point, cover the dish with wax paper.
  
  Bake for 30 minutes. Serve hot, sprinkled with additional cinnamon,
  allspice or nutmeg (or all three) if desired.

      Title: ACORN SQUASH SEEDS
 Categories: Snacks, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Acorn squash
      1 ts Margarine
           Salt to taste
 
  NOTE:  Acorn squash seeds taste similar to pumpkin seeds except that
  the hulls on the squash seed are smaller. Therefore they are less dry
  tasting than pumpkin seeds and don't get caught in your throat as
  easily.
  
  Cut uncooked squash in half and scoop out seeds. Clean pulp and
  strings off the seeds in a collander under running water. Set the
  seeds on a towel to dry. Preheat oven to 350 deg. The seeds in a
  small bowl. Either melt margarine and pour onto seeds or put solid
  margarine into bowl and mix with you hands (my preferred method).
  Spread seeds evenly on a cookie sheet. Place in oven and cook 10 min.
  or until just starts to turn brown.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
    3/4 lb Sweet butter
      8    Egg yolks
      1 c  Brown sugar
    1/3 c  White sugar
    1/3 c  Ground almonds
      1 tb All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
      8    Egg whites
      1 tb Cream of tartar
 
  In a large saucepan over very low heat, melt chocolate. Add butter,
  stir until melted and remove from heat (the mixture should be body
  temperature, not too hot to touch with a finger). In a large bowl,
  combine egg yolks, brown and white sugar, and stir until well mixed.
  Add the chocolate, and stir well until combined. In a small bowl,
  combine almonds, flour and cornmeal, stir until well mixed. Pour this
  into the chocolate and stir until combined. In a large bowl with an
  electric mixer, beat the egg whites with cream of tartar until they
  form stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the chocolate in three
  batches.  Chef Dale Nichols warns that folding egg whites into
  chocolate takes a real knack and suggests using your hand as the
  paddle.  To do this by hand, use your hand as a paddle and push your
  palm down to the centre of the bowl, and slide up the side of the
  bowl and turn your hand over. Do not over-mix or you will knock the
  air out of the egg whites causing a much denser texture. Bake in a
  buttered, floured 10 inch spring form pan for 5 minutes at 400F.
  Reduce heat to 350F and bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, or until
  cake tests done in the centre. Let cool completely before removing
  from pan.

      Title: ADAI
 Categories: Vegetarian, Indian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Rice
    1/3 c  Urad dal
    1/3 c  Chana dal
    1/3 c  Yellow split peas
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Red chili powder
      1 lg Onion (opt)
      1    Carrot (opt)
    1/4 c  Coconut, grated (opt)
 
  Mix rice, chana dal, urad dal, and yellow split peas in a large
  vessel. Soak in a lot of water for about 2 hours.
  
  Grind the soaked mixture with chili powder and salt coarsely, without
  adding much water.
  
  Ferment for about 3 - 4 hours, then refrigerate or freeze. In cold
  weather, the fermenting process might take longer, and it might be a
  good idea to ferment in an oven (the pilot light will keep the
  mixture warm).
  
  Add either onions (finely cut), carrot (grated) or coconut before
  preparing.
  
  Freezing Notes
  
  If freezing, only ferment for about an hour.  The mixture will have
  to be left out for a while before being ready to use.

      Title: ADAI(SAVORY INDIAN PANCAKES)
 Categories: Digest, Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Mixture of dhals*
      2 c  Long grained rice
           Salt to taste.
 
  *(use any combination of tur dhal, chana dal or even split yellow
  peas)
  
  Wash and rinse the dhals and rice thoroughly. When the rinse water
  runs clear, soak the dhals and rice together in a bowl with fresh
  water for a couple of hours. Drain the dhal-rice mixture and grind
  into a somewhat coarse mixture in a blender using water when
  necessary. Empty the batter into a bowl, add some salt and let it
  rest for at least an hour. You could also let it ferment overnight if
  you like a sourdough tang in your pancakes.
  
  To make the pancakes, heat a non-stick/well-seasoned cast iron
  skillet on a moderate stove. If a few drops of water bounce off the
  pan, the pan is hot enough and you can proceed to make the pancakes.
  
  Drop a ladleful of the pre-prepared batter in the center of the pan
  and with the back of the ladle, swirl the batter from inside to
  outside to form a thin round pancake. Wait till the top looks dry,
  wait another minute if you like them crisp and flip to cook the other
  side. Remove onto a plate and eat immediately with a nice coriander
  chutney. (Continue preparing pancakes in the same way, till you run
  out of batter and/or chutney. The batter will also keep in the fridge
  for almost a week and you can prepare the pancakes when the mood
  strikes you.)
  
  Variation: Can add finely chopped onions/jalapenos/spinach/ginger/a
  few cumin seeds, anything you fancy, to the batter before making the
  pancakes. You will however not be able to make neat circular
  pancakes. Instead, you will end up with (tasty) irregular shaped ones.

      1    Info/help
 
  REDUCE CHOLESTEROL ~ Use vegetable oil or margarine instead of butter
  ~ Substitute 2 egg whites for 1 egg, or use egg substitute ~ Use more
  vegetables and grains and less meat in recipe ~ Use soy-based product
  to replace part of meat eg. tofu ~ Use nonfat milk products instead
  of whole milk
  
  REDUCE FAT CONTENT ~ Use reduced calorie mayonnaise and salad
  dressing ~ Blend cottage cheese or yogurt with milk for sour cream
  topping ~ Replace regular whipping cream with low-cal topping or
  yogurt ~ Remove visible fat from meat and skin from poultry before
  cooking ~ Decrease oil in marinades and salad dressing; increase
  vinegar, water and seasonings ~ Use foods canned in their own juice
  or water ~ De-fat meat drippings by refrigerating and skimming fat
  off the top ~ Decrease the amount of fat used in baked goods by 1/3
  to 1/2 and increase fluids called for to reach desired consistency. ~
  Cheese that is finely grated or thinly sliced goes further ~ Pour
  some of the fat off the top of "natural" peanut butters
  
  REDUCE SODIUM CONTENT ~ Use low-salt or no-salt-added products ~
  Increase your use of herbs and spices in place of salt in recipes ~
  Use fresh foods whenever possible in place of canned or processed
  (soup mixes, cured meats etc) or rinse canned foods (tuna) with water
  ~ Do not add salt to water when cooking pasta or other foods
  
  REDUCE SUGAR CONTENT ~ Decrease the amount of sugar called for in
  traditional recipes by at least 1/3; substitute fruit juices, nectars
  or pureed fruits. ~ Use fruit canned in water or fruit juice ~ Use
  non caloric sweeteners if needed to increase the sweetness of a
  recipe without added calories.  (Most baked desserts require at least
  3/4 tsp. sugar per serving to achieve a desirable flavor.)

      Title: ADDICTIVE CREAM OF BROCCOLI SOUP
 Categories: Broccoli, Dairy, Cheese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
  2 fresh broccoli (each about 3-in. bottom diameter) 1/2 lb butter 2
  to 6 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tb Chervil (fresh/dried chopped) 1 ts
  salt 1 ts white pepper 3 c milk (full-cream milk) 1 md egg yolk,
  beaten 1/4 c flour 1/8 ts cardamom 1/8 ts mace 1 c heavy cream
  (whipping) 1/3 c Gruyere cheese (fresh,
      grate fine) 1/3 c parmesan cheese (grate to
      powder)
  
  (1)  Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces.  Discard the hard stem
  pieces, but
     keep tender leaves and stem parts.
  
  (2)  Steam the cut broccoli for about 5-8 minutes, until just bright
  green
     in color.  Do not over- cook.
  
  (3)  In a 10-inch enameled (non-metal) skillet, heat 6 oz of butter
  until
     melted.  Add chopped garlic and wait until butter is hot enough to
     cook in. Add steamed broccoli, then chervil to the skillet. Lightly
     salt the broccoli.
  
  (4)  Cover, and cook over medium low heat, stirring occasionally with
  a
     wooden spoon, for another 5-10 minutes or until the broccoli turns
  a
     darker green color and becomes very soft.
  
  (5)  Mash the broccoli right in the skillet until no large pieces
  remain.
     Use a potato masher or a strong wooden spoon.  Mash until there
  are no
     pieces remaining that are too big to fit in a soup spoon.
  
  (6)  While broccoli is cooking, add beaten egg yolk to
        2    cups of milk.
  
  (7)  Put 3 Tbsp butter into a 2-3 quart saucepan.  Use enamel or
  glass for
     best soup flavor.  Metal pans will make this soup bitter. Melt
  butter
     and add flour.  When the flour bubbles and starts to cook, add the
     egg/milk mixture into the saucepan.  Add the cardamom, mace, and
  white
     pepper.  Stir con- tents of saucepan constantly with wooden spoon
     until thick. Lower the cooking heat.
  
  (8)  Empty the mashed broccoli mixture into the sau- cepan. Stir until
     well-mixed. Slowly stir in the remaining milk and the cream. As
  soon
     as the soup becomes hot enough to cook again, add the grated
  cheeses.
  
  (9)  Turn the heat down lower and simmer for about 5 more minutes,
  stirring
     to allow the cheeses to melt and mix while the table is being set.
     Serve immediately and retire quickly so as not to be trampled by
  those
     who smelled it cooking.
  
  NOTES This recipe may be doubled, halved or whatever without penalty.
  Vary
     the amount of milk added the second time to change the soup
  thickness
     to your own tastes.  You also may use any fresh green vegetable as
  a
     substitute for the broc- coli. Asparagus tips, artichoke hearts,
  and
     corn are espe- cially nice.  Cook them in the same way as you did
  the
     broc- coli.  Use any leftover butter on the hard French finger
  rolls.

 Categories: Bakery, Breads
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast (1/4 oz)
    1/4 c  Lukewarm water
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Vegetable shortening, melted
      1 c  Cold water
  4 1/2 c  All purpose flour
 
  In a large bowl, soften the yeast in the lukewarm water. Mix the
  salt, 2 tablespoons of the shortening, and the cold water together
  and add to the yeast mixture. Sift in the flour gradually, beating
  well after each addition for a smooth consistency.  You will probably
  have to knead in the final cup of flour. Shape the dough into a ball,
  brish lightly with the remaining shortening, and cover with a dry
  cloth.  Set the bowl in a warm place until doubled in bulk, anout 1
  hour. Punch the dough down and, on a floured board, knead about 5
  minutes. Shape into 2 round loaves on a well greased baking sheet.
  Cover with a dry cloth and set to rise another 45 minutes. Preheat
  the oven to 400F. Bake the loaves on a cookie sheet 50 minutes, until
  they are light brown and sound hollow when tapped.

      Title: ADOBO
 Categories: Mexican, Marinades
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
      8    Cloves of Garlic, unpeeled
      4    Dried chiles Anchos
           -stemmed,seeded,deveined
           -about 2 ounces
      6    Dried chiles Guajillos
           -stemmed,seeded,deveined
           -about 1 1/2 ounces
    1/2    Inch stick cinnamon
           -about 1/2 t ground
      1    Clove, or a pinch ground
     10    Black peppercorns
           -scant 1/4 t ground
      2 lg Bay Leaves broken up
    1/8 ts Cumin seed, or 1/8 t ground
    1/2 ts Dried Oregano
    1/2 ts Dried Thyme
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
 
   Toasting the chiles and garlic. Roast the garlic cloves on a griddle
  or heavy skillet over medium heat, turning frequently, until
  blackened in spots and VERY soft, about 15 minutes. Remove, cool,
  skin and roughly chop.
   While the garlic is roasting, tear the chiles into flat pieces and
  toast them a few at a time: Use a metal spatula to press them firmly
  against the hot surface for a few seconds, until they blister,
  crackle and change color, then flip them over and press them flat to
  toast the other side.
   Soaking the dried chiles. Break the chiles into a small bowl, cover
  with boiling water, weight with a plate to keep submerged and soak 30
  minutes. Drain, tear into smaller pieces, place in a blender jar and
  add the garlic.
   Finishing the Adobo. In a mortar or spice grinder, pulverize the
  cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cumin. Add the chiles
  along with the oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 3 Tb water. With a
  long series of blender pulses, reduce the mixture to a paste. Run the
  blender for a few seconds until the mixture clogs, then scrape down
  the sides with a spatula and stir; repeat a dozen times or more until
  the mixture is smooth. Don't add water unless absolutely necessary or
  this marinating paste won't do its job well. Strain the paste through
  a medium-mesh sieve into a noncorrosive container with a
  tight-fitting lid. Cover and refrigerate.
   Considerations: After soaking the chiles, they can be put through a
  foley food mill to remove the skins and the seeds. Add this puree
  along with the garlic to the small blender jar and proceed. If this
  is done, and the mixture is put together in a small blender jar, and
  pulsed, scraped down, and mixed very well the final sieving can be
  eliminated.
   All of the chiles can be Ancho or Guajillo. You can substitute 3 1/2
  ounces of California or New Mexican chiles for the above chiles but
  the flavor will be light.
   Adobo with powdered chiles: For a darker, stronger tasting adobo made
  without the tedious series of blender runs, roast the chiles and
  garlic as directed above, then pulverize the chiles with the
  cinnamon,cloves,pepper, bay leaves and cumin in several batches in a
  spice grinder; sift through a medium-mesh sieve. Skin the garlic and
  mash it to a smooth paste. Mix with the powdered chile mixture,

      Title: ADOBO (MEXICAN SMOKED CHILE MARINADE)
 Categories: Condiments, Spices, Mexican, Marinades
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Oranges
      1    Lime
      2    To 3 canned chipotle chilies
           -or to taste
      3    Cloves garlic (1 T)
      2 ts Dried oregano
    1/2 ts Cumin seed
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      2 tb Wine vinegar
    1/2 ts Salt

  This spicy marinade owes its unusual flavor to the chipotle, a smoked
  jalapeno chile.  Chipotles are usually sold canned in tomato paste.
  Look for them at Mexican and Latin American markets. Adobo marinade
  goes particularly well with pork.
  
  Juice the oranges and lime.  Finely chop chilies and garlic. Place
  citrus juices, chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, black pepper, vinegar
  and salt in blender and puree until smooth.
  
  Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 to 2 pounds meat or chicken.

      Title: ADOBO (SMOKED CHILE MARINADE) #1
 Categories: Marinades
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
      8    Cloves of Garlic, unpeeled
      4    Dried chiles Anchos
           -stemmed,seeded,deveined
           -about 2 ounces
      6    Dried chiles Guajillos
           -stemmed,seeded,deveined
           -about 1 1/2 ounces
    1/2    Inch stick cinnamon
           -about 1/2 t ground
      1    Clove, or a pinch ground
     10    Black peppercorns
           -scant 1/4 t ground
      2 lg Bay Leaves broken up
    1/8 ts Cumin seed, or 1/8 t ground
    1/2 ts Dried Oregano
    1/2 ts Dried Thyme
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
 
   Toasting the chiles and garlic. Roast the garlic cloves on a griddle
  or heavy skillet over medium heat, turning frequently, until
  blackened in spots and VERY soft, about 15 minutes. Remove, cool,
  skin and roughly chop.
   While the garlic is roasting, tear the chiles into flat pieces and
  toast them a few at a time: Use a metal spatula to press them firmly
  against the hot surface for a few seconds, until they blister,
  crackle and change color, then flip them over and press them flat to
  toast the other side.
   Soaking the dried chiles. Break the chiles into a small bowl, cover
  with boiling water, weight with a plate to keep submerged and soak 30
  minutes. Drain, tear into smaller pieces, place in a blender jar and
  add the garlic.
   Finishing the Adobo. In a mortar or spice grinder, pulverize the
  cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cumin. Add the chiles
  along with the oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 3 Tb water. With a
  long series of blender pulses, reduce the mixture to a paste. Run the
  blender for a few seconds until the mixture clogs, then scrape down
  the sides with a spatula and stir; repeat a dozen times or more until
  the mixture is smooth. Don't add water unless absolutely necessary or
  this marinating paste won't do its job well. Strain the paste through
  a medium-mesh sieve into a noncorrosive container with a
  tight-fitting lid. Cover and refrigerate.
   Considerations: After soaking the chiles, they can be put through a
  foley food mill to remove the skins and the seeds. Add this puree
  along with the garlic to the small blender jar and proceed. If this
  is done, and the mixture is put together in a small blender jar, and
  pulsed, scraped down, and mixed very well the final sieving can be
  eliminated.
   All of the chiles can be Ancho or Guajillo. You can substitute 3 1/2
  ounces of California or New Mexican chiles for the above chiles but
  the flavor will be light.
   Adobo with powdered chiles: For a darker, stronger tasting adobo made
  without the tedious series of blender runs, roast the chiles and
  garlic as directed above, then pulverize the chiles with the
  cinnamon,cloves,pepper, bay leaves and cumin in several batches in a
  spice grinder; sift through a medium-mesh sieve. Skin the garlic and
  mash it to a smooth paste. Mix with the powdered chile mixture,
  oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 6 Tb water. Store as directed above.

      Title: ADOBO CHICKEN WINGS
 Categories: Chicken, Phillipines
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
    3/4 c  Vinegar
      1 ea Whole head of garlic, peel
           -and crush cloves
           1-2 bay leaves
      5 ea Peppercorns
      2 tb Brown sugar
      3 lb Of chicken wings
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix everything but the wings together.
  Place wings in large pan, layering is okay, but make sure that the
  pan is large enough to hold the wings and sauce. Pour sauce over the
  wings, and bake until wings are done and golden brown.  Stir
  occasionally. Typically, Adobo is done with a whole chicken, and
  simmered stove top and served with white rice.  It's fairly flexible,
  some folks will broil the chicken after simmering to crisp it up a
  little, and reduce the sauce a bit. Others will add a cup or two of
  water during the simmering process. Some add brown sugar for a little
  sweetness, and/or cayenne to spice it up a bit. Adobo Chicken Wings

      Title: ADOBONG PUSIT (SQUID WITH GARLIC & TOMATO)
 Categories: Ethnic, Seafood
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 kg Small fresh squids
    1/2 c  Native vinegar
     10    Cloves garlic
           Salt and pepper to taste

  Got down my single Filipino cook book and found this little gem. My
  grasp of Tagalog is non-existent but I'd guess that the name
  translates as "Squid Adobo". At any rate, it's squid stewed in
  vinegar. I assume that the reference to "native vinegar" refers to
  nipa sap vinegar (sukang paombong). The bottle I have is a milky
  looking vinegar that tastes pretty much like any vinegar so I imagine
  that you have some latitude on what type you can use.
  
  For those of you who have never tried it, Filipino food is an
  intriguing cuisine that has elements of Southeast Asian, Chinese and
  Mexican or Spanish influences. It has everything from spring rolls
  (lumpias) to rellenos dishes.
  
  Wash the squids very well.  Remove the long thin membrane in the head
  and slit the eyes to bring out the ink. Place the squids in a
  saucepan with vinegar, 6 cloves garlic crushed, salt and pepper.
  Cover and cook slowly until the squids are tender.  Cut cooked squids
  into 1/2 inch slices crosswise.
  
  Crush remaining garlic and saute in a little lard in another pan. Add
  the onion and tomatoes and cook until tomatoes are very soft. Add the
  squids and the liquid in which they were boiled. Simmer for 7

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Pike, skinned & boned
  1 1/4 c  ;Water
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Butter, unsalted
           ;Salt & fresh ground pepper
      4    Eggs yolks

MMMMM------------------------WHITE SAUCE-----------------------------
      1 qt Chicken stock, hmmade or can
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
           ;Salt & fresh ground pepper
    1/2 c  Shredded Parmesan cheese
 
  Author's note: Adolph Frey owns one of the few Michelin-rated 2-star
  restaurants in Germany. He made this dish at the lodge for Carl's
  birthday celebration 1 year. Quenelles are poached fish-&-egg mounds
  traditionally made w/pike.
  
  To make quenelles, grind pike in food processor, or use a tamis if
  you have one. Set aside.
  
  Bring water to a boil. Sift in flour & stir until water is absorbed.
  Keep stirring so that mixture doesn't stick to pan. Remove from heat
  & beat in 1 egg. Cool mixture, then refrigerate until cold. Remove
  mixture from refrigerator & blend it in food processor until smooth.
  This is the panade.
  
  Cream butter in small bowl. Put ground pike in bowl that is set inside
  another bowl of ice. Season w/salt & pepper, mix in panade, &
  gradually add other whole egg & all egg yolks. When blended well, add
  butter. This can be done in food processor if all ingreds are kept
  cold. Chill mixture for 30 mins.
  
  To make white sauce, place chicken stock in heavy saucepan over medium
  heat. Bring to simmer, then reduce heat & continue to simmer on low
  until stock is reduced down to 1 cup liquid, abt. 45 mins.
  
  In large saucepan over med. heat, reduce cream until it begins to
  thicken, whisking occasionally.
  
  whisk thickened cream into stock, adding more or less cream,
  deepending on desired consistency. Season w/salt & pepper to taste.
  Strain sauce through a fine-mesh sieve, if desired. Makes 2 cups.
  
  To assemble dish, shape quenelles by mounding mixture between 2 warmed
  spoons. Set each quenelle on floured surface.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F. Butter baking dish large enough to hold
  quenelles. In wide saucepan, bring 3 qts water to a boil & poach
  quenelles for 15 mins w/o letting water boil. Drain thoroughly.
  arrange quenelles in prepared baking dish.
  
  Nap quenelles w/enough white sauce to cover. Sprinkle w/Parmesan.
  Bake for 15-20 mins, unti cheese browns. Serve 2-3 quenelles per
  diner.

  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute'
  the red pepper, mushrooms, and garlic until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
  Remove the pan from the heat.
  
  Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a large, heavy saucepan
  over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, and let it cook for a minute or
  two. Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly until thickened,
  about 3 to 5 minutes.
  
  Add the salt, paprika, mustard, basil, Romano cheese, and pepper to
  taste stirring until the cheese is melted. Reduce the heat to very
  low, and stir in the sauteed vegetables.
  
  When the ravioli is tender and begins to float , after about 10 to 12
  minutes, drain it well, and transfer it to a large serving bowl.
  
  Pour on the sauce, and toss gently.  Garnish with paprika, and serve
  with Parmesan on the side.
  
  Tender ravioli, asparagus, and mushrooms tossed with a Dijon and basil
  cheese sauce make for this elegant entree, named for Italy's beautiful
  Adriatic coast. 4 servings

      Title: ADVENT COOKIES
 Categories: Gifts, Cookies
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1    -teacup molasses or black
           -treacle
      7 oz Light brown sugar
      9 tb Cocoa powder
     10 oz Butter or margarine;
           -softened
        pn Cinnamon
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 lb Plain flour (approximately)
 
  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Mix all of the ingredients together,
  except for the flour.  Add the flour slowly to the rest of the
  mixture until it reaches the right consistency to roll out. The dough
  should be quite soft. (You may find it easier to knead it with your
  hands.) Roll out on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4
  inch and cut into decorative shapes with small cookie cutters, a
  sharp knife or the rim of a glass. Place on a greased baking sheet
  and bake in the oven for about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven while
  they are still soft and cool on a rack, then pack into crocks or jars.
  
  The authors note that the Pennsylvania Dutch settlers made these at
  Thanksgiving and stored them in a stoneware crock until Christmas. The
  cookies can be made at any time, but allowed to age for 4-6 weeks.
  They can be used as a substitute for graham crackers for a pie crust.

      Title: ADVOCAAT  (DUTCH EGGNOG)
 Categories: Ethnic, Beverages, Alcohol
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     10    Eggs
    1/2    Level teaspoon salt
    275 g  Sugar
      4 dl Cognac
      1    1/2 level teaspoons vanilla
           -essence (extract, I think)
 
  Separate the eggs and beat the yolks with the salt and the sugar,
  until the mixture is thick and creamy. Beat in the cognac, very
  slowly and put the mixture into a double saucepan. Heat gently,
  whisking all the time until the advocaat is warm (not hot) and thick.
  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla essence. Pour
  into a jug. Advocaat is served in a glass and eaten with a teaspoon.
  It can also be topped with whipped cream.
  
  Also, might I add, that advocaat is nothing like the eggnog here in
  America...it is thick and creamy---not foamy at all. Boy, is Advocaat
  delicious!
  
  (I usually get a bottle of it from the Dutch-America store and skip
  the above...:)
  
  This delicious Dutch drink is actually eaten with a spoon!

 Categories: Cakes, Pies, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     80 g  Butter or Margarine
     80 g  Sugar
      1    Vanilla Sugar
      6    Egg Yolks

    100 g  Chocolate Crumbs
 
  Cream butter or margarine. Add sugar and vanilla sugar little at a
  time. Mix in egg-yolks. Mix almonds with baking powder and stir
  together with the chocolate into the dough. Add rum and brandy. Beat
  the egg-whites until stiff and stir carefully into the dough.
  
  Fill the dough into a round baking-form covered with baking-paper
  (paper that prevents sticking). Bake it in a preheated oven for about
  60 minutes at 175C
  
  Let it cool down (or out?).
  
  Whip cream until stiff and put onto the cooled cake. Pour egg liquer
  over it.

      Title: ADVOKAAT
 Categories: Drinks, Alcohol
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Vanilla sugar
      2 c  Milk
      9    Egg yolks
  1 1/2 c  Grain alcohol
           -(95-percent)
 
  Mix sugars.  Boil milk with half of sugars for two minutes. Let it
  cool down. (For the milk it is easiest to use a pot which can later
  be used with a mixer.)
  
  Mix well (mixer at high speed) the yolks with the other half of the
  sugars. Using mixer add to milk. Then (still using mixer) add alcohol
  slowly. (The result is quite fluid, sweet and strong.)  Bottle and
  let rest for two weeks to let the mixture thicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Egg-cognac:  a potent sweet alcoholic beverage -- Advokaat is the
  Dutch word for egg cognac.  It is highly recommended for A. I.
  (Alcohol Imbibing) meetings. This recipe is my modification of a
  recipe I obtained in Poland. It makes a potent, superb advokaat (or
  egg-cognac). The milk and eggs are healthy, the sugar and alcohol are
  not. Yield: Serves 4-8.
  
  *  This advokaat can be drunk or, better yet, eaten with a spoon; it
  is quite thick.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2 weeks aging.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

      Title: AEBLESKIVER NO APPLES
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Milk
      3    Eggs, separated
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      4 ts Baking power
      1 tb Sugar
           Vegetable oil
 
  Combine milk and egg yolks.  Sift together dry ingredients and add to
  milk/egg mixutre.  Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into mixture.
  Heat aebleskiver pan and put about 1 tsp oil in each cup of the pan.
  when very hot, pour enough batter in each cup to almost fill it. Use
  knitting needle (or any pointed tool) to turn aebleskivers. Keep
  turning them until golden brown.  Add shortening as needed for each
  new batch. Makes about 3 dozen.
  
  This recipe was a huge hit at my summer beach house -- we had it every
  Saturday!  We top them with powdered sugar, fresh berries, and whipped
  cream.
  
  Good luck finding the pans -- mine was a gift.  I later found one
  more at a discount cooking store at the shore. However, this year I
  searched the shore and the Washington area and have yet to find
  another. The store managers of the discount places say they never
  know what they are going to get.   Since my first one came from some
  catalogue (they don't even sell them anymore!) you might try calling
  a very high end cookware store and seeing if they can order you one.
  The pans are cast-iron, so you'd need a distributor of cast-iron
  cookware. (Hmm -- you could also check the manufacturer of whatever
  is in the stores and call the company directly.) Let me know if you
  have any success.
  
  By the way -- I started making these because my husband is Dutch, and
  Holland considers aebleskivers ~- which they call "Poffritches" -- a
  great delicacy!

      2 c  Buttermilk
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Flour
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Cardamom
 
  Beat yolks of eggs with buttermilk.

  Beat egg whites until stiff.
  
  Mix egg yolk-buttermilk mixture with dry ingredients. Add egg whites,
  carefully folding them in so that they don't break down.
  
  Heat aebleskive pan. Put 1 tsp salad oil in each hole and fill
  completely with batter. Let bake until slightly crusty on bottom.
  Turn slightly with a knitting needle or skewer. Continue cooking,
  turning the ball to keep it from burning, until the knitting needle
  comes out clean when stuck in the center.
  
  Serve aebleskive hot with powdered sugar, jam, and jelly.
  
  Notes included with recipe: For those of you who are unfamiliar with
  aebleskive, it is a baked delight made with a pancake-like batter,
  cooked in a special pan that turns the aebleskive into a crusty ball,
  and is known as the "Danish Doughnut." As you can tell, it is a
  little difficult to give aebleskive an easy definition other than to
  tell you that it is good enough to go ahead and order the pans if you
  are likely to serve breakfasts and brunches to family and friends.
  
  Aebleskive pans are available through most gourmet cookware shops or
  can be ordered from Pea Soup Andersen's Santa Ynez Valley Wine Center,
  (805)-688-5581.

      Title: AFGHAN CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 lg Cloves garlic
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Plain, whole-milk yogurt
           Juice and pulp of 1 large
           -lemon, 3 to 4 tablespoons
    1/2 ts Cracked black pepper
      2 lg Whole chicken breasts, about
           -2 pounds
 
  Long, slow marinating in garlicky yogurt tenderizes, moistens and
  adds deep flavor, so you end up with skinless grilled chicken that's
  as delicious as it is nutritionally correct. Serve with soft pita or
  Arab flatbread and fresh yogurt.
  
  Put the salt in a wide, shallow non-reactive bowl with the garlic and
  mash them together until you have paste. Add yogurt, lemon and pepper.
  
  Skin the chicken breasts, remove all visible fat and separate the
  halves. Bend each backward to break the bones so the pieces win lie
  flat. Add to the yogurt and turn so all surfaces are well-coated.
  
  Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate. Allow to marinate at least
  overnight, up to a day and a half. Turn when you think of it.
  
  To cook, remove breasts from marinade and wipe off all but a thin
  film. Broil or grill about 6 inches from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes
  a side, or until thoroughly cooked. Meat will brown somewhat but
  should not char. Serve at once.

  heavy influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa. Curry powders
  are made from different proportions of spices, dried and ground.
  Spices can be dried in the sun for two to three days, in a low
  temperature oven, or on top of the stove in a dry skillet. If using a
  skillet be sure to shake the spices constantly so they don't burn.
  Grinding is usually done with a mortar and pestle.  Curry powders are
  not necessarily hot, they are made that way by the addition of chili
  peppers.
  
  Brown the spices in a hot oven until crisp.  Grind and seal in an
  airtight container until used.  Add 1 teas. powdered turmeric, and
  chili powder to taste for every teas. of your special curry powder.

      2 tb Ghee -=OR=- vegetable oil
      3 ea Whole cloves
      1 lg Onion, chopped

           Salt & pepper
           Cilantro, chopped
 
  Heat ghee or vegetable oil with the whole cloves over low heat. When
  hot, add the onions & garlic & saute, stirring occasionally, for a
  few moments. Add the carrots & potatoes & continue to saute for 5
  minutes, stir to prevent sticking.  Add the green beans & saute for
  just a few more minutes. Slowly stir in the coconut milk.  Use only
  as much as you need to create a thick sauce: the vegetables should
  not be swimming in milk. Carefully bring to a boil, reduce heat &
  simmer until the vegetables are cooked, 15 to 20 minutes.  Stir
  occasionally otherwise the milk & vegetables will burn. Garnish with
  cilantro. Serve with an Ethiopian Lentil stew or with an Indian dal
  to mix cuisines, & bread. If you prefer the vegetables to be hotter,
  add more berbere. It is best if this dish is made ahead of time &
  then left to let the flavours marry. In place of cilantro, use fresh
  parsley.

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Onion (very large),
           -chopped
      1    Swiss chard bunch
      1 cn Garbanzo beans
           -(known also as chick
           -peas, ceci, etc.)
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Rice, raw
      2    Yams
           Several fresh tomatoes
           -(or large can)
      1    Garlic clove
           -(or more to taste)
           Salt and pepper,
           -to taste
           Tabasco sauce,
           -to taste
 
  Fry onion, garlic and white stems of chard until barely limp. Add
  chopped greens and fry a bit.
  
  Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a vegetable brush, then
  slice them into thick slices. Add garbanzos, raisins, yams, tomatoes,
  salt and pepper.  Cook a couple of minutes.
  
  Make a well in the center of the mixture in the pot. Put the rice in
  the well and pat it down until it's wet. Cover and cook until rice is
  done, about 25 minutes. Add Tabasco sauce to taste.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy vegetable stew -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got
  it from a friend. It's very easy to make.
  
  *  I find that the flavors of the vegetables don't stand out unless
  you put in a lot of tabasco. But then, I've got a cast-iron tongue.
  You should add enough to make the stew seem spicy to you.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Hot water
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      3 tb Unsalted butter, melted
    1/3 c  Shredded coconut
      1 lg Egg
    1/2 c  Sour cream
           Glaze:
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Sifted confectioner's sugar
      2 tb Water
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  The light and moist cupcakes have a delicate cinnamon-scented
  chocolate glaze that's spread over them while they are still warm.
  
  1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375
  degrees F. Line twelve 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with paper liners.
  
  2. Place cocoa in a small bowl and stir in 1/2 cup very hot tap water
  to dissolve.
  
  3. In a large bowl combine the melted butter and sugar; beat with an
  electric mixer until blended. Add the egg and beat until light, 1 to 2
  minutes. Add the cocoa mixture and beat until smooth. In a small bowl
  stir together the sour cream and baking soda. Stir this mixture into
  the butter-sugar mixture. Add the flour and vanilla; beat quickly,
  just until evenly blended. With a spoon stir in the coconut.
  
  Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, dividing it evenly among them;
  they will be about three-quarters full. Bake about 20 minutes, until
  the tops spring back when lightly touched and a toothpick inserted in
  the center comes out clean. Remove the tea cakes from the pan and
  cool slightly on a rack while you prepare the glaze.
  
  4. Spread about 2 teaspoons of the chocolate glaze on each of the
  warm tea cakes and let cool thoroughly.
  
  Chocolate Glaze:
  
  Makes 1/2 cup
  
  Drizzle this simple and tasty glaze over the afternoon tea cakes or
  over any cake that's been frosted with seven-minute caramel frosting.
  
  1. In a small saucepan combine the butter with 2 tablespoons water.
  Place over low heat, add the chocolate, and stir until the chocolate
  melts and the mixture thickens slightly; remove from the heat.
  
  2. In a small bowl combine the confectioner's sugar and cinnamon;
  stir in the chocolate mixture and the vanilla to make a smooth glaze.

  *  The sandwiches should be small enough to be eaten in two or three
  bites.
  
  *  Use fresh, close-textured white or brown bread, thinly sliced.
  
  *  Whipped butter at room temperature is easy to spread without
  tearing the bread.  Spread it thinly right to edges of bread.
  
  *  Sandwiches with fillings like ham, chopped egg, smoked salmon or
  anchovy paste can be made early in the day. Trim crusts within an
  hour or two of serving.
  
  *  Hold the sandwich firmly and trim crusts with a sharp knife. Cut
  into four triangles or three rectangles; cover with dampened tea
  towel and refrigerate.
  
  *  To serve a dozen or fewer guests, three varieties are sufficient.
  For larger occasions, provide about five varieties.

  The tangy tingling sensation it causes after being splashed on is one
  way to describe an aftershave. Most aftershaves act as astringents;
  they help firm skin tone and close skin pores when applied
  immediately after shaving. Many aftershaves contain alcohol, which
  possesses antibacterial abilities, helping to prevent infections of
  knicks or shaving cuts. It also should contain glycerine and/or other
  ingredients known to be beneficial to skin care. Glycerine will help
  counter the drying effects on the skin, and the chafing and
  irritation that can develop with dry skin. *Most drug stores contain
  all of the above tinctures and oils. Herb and health food shops carry
  the essential oils.

  lightly. Heat vegetable oil to medium hot (350 to 375 degrees). Add
  the tofu, a few at a time.  Fry until golden and remove to drain on
  paper towels. Prepare sauce by placing the water, soy or tamari
  sauce, sweetener and stock in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil and mix
  well, making sure sugar (if using) is dissolved.  To serve, place a
  small amount of the sauce on four warmed plates. Divide the tofu
  evenly among the plates, placing them on the sauce. Garnish with
  grated ginger and chopped scallions.

      Title: AGGIE'S IRISH SODA BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached white flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
     12 tb (1 1/2 sticks) cold, sweet
           -butter
      2 c  Raisins
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Honey
      1 c  Buttermilk
 
  Makes 1 large loaf.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Sift the flour, baking powder, soda and salt into a large mixing
  bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add. Cut it into the flour
  with a pastry blender until the mixture is the size of peas. Add the
  raisins and toss to distribute evenly, using two forks.
  
  Beat the egg in another bowl until very frothy.  Beat in the honey.
  When it is well blended, beat in the buttermilk.
  
  Gradually pour the liquids into the flour, tossing all the while with
  a fork so the mixture gets evenly moistened. Continue tossing lightly
  with two forks until the batter comes together; it doesn't have to be
  completely mixed and should be very rough and lumpy.
  
  Butter a heavy skillet or casserole, 10 to 11 inches in diameter and
  2 to 3 inches deep.  Round is the traditional shape. Spoon batter out
  into the pan and push it gently to fill the pan. It can mound up
  somewhat in the middle. Bake at 350 F about an hour or until the
  middle is set. Cut out a piece to test if necessary.
  
  Cut into wedges and serve warm from the pan.

 Categories: Greek, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  The classic Greek sauce, avgolemono, is a great low-fat alternative
  to the melted butter, mayonnaise or vinaigrette dipping sauces
  usually served with artichokes.
  
  Snap the stems off four large artichokes and trim the bases so that
  they will sit upright on a plate.  Boil a potful of water to which
  you have added the juice of a lemon and a pinch of salt. Drop the
  artichokes in and boil for 30 minutes or until they are tender. Test
  by pulling off an outer leaf and trying the flesh at the base for
  tenderness.
  
  Meanwhile, in another saucepan, bring a cup of chicken stock to the
  boil. In a cup, mix about two-thirds of a tablespoon of cornflour
  with a little water until it is smooth and add to the boiling stock,
  stirring until it thickens.
  
  Separate 3 eggs, beat the whites until they hold stiff peaks, then
  add the yolks and continue beating tin the whole mass is fluffy.
  Still beating, add the juice of a lemon and pour in the boiling
  stock. Pour this mixture back into the stock saucepan, and stir it
  over a low heat for a couple of minutes.  It must not boil.
  
  Place the artichokes in the centre of warmed plates and pour the
  avgolemono over them.  Serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  1. Prepare the pasta.  Place dry ingredients and butter in food
  processor fitted with a pastry blade and run machine for 1 minute, or
  until butter is cut up and mixture feels sandy.  Add eggs and run
  machine in quick spurts for 2 minutes, or until dough forms a compact
  ball. 2. Cut dough into 4-5 small pieces.  Lightly flour each and
  roll it through pasta machine (set rollers at widest gap). When dough
  is smooth, reduce gap between rollers and roll the dough again.
  Continue in this fashion until rollers are at their narrowest
  setting.  As dough sheets come out, dust them lightly with flour and
  spread them out on the table. 3. Prepare filling. Steam spinach for
  30 seconds or until tender, rinse it under cold water, and squeeze it
  tightly to extract all the water. Place the spinach and remaining
  ingredients for filling in food processor and grind until smooth.

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      8 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 lb Mascarpone
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Salt & black pepper to taste
      1 pn Freshly grated nutmeg

MMMMM--------------------------TO SERVE-------------------------------
      8 tb Parmesan cheese; grated
 
  Cut the prosciutto and pancetta into small pieces and remove the
  casing from the sausages. Using a meat grinder, grind together the
  prosciutto, pancetta, and sausages. Place the ground meat in a
  crockery or glass bowl, add the butter and eggs, and mix very well
  with a wooden spoon until the butter is completely incorporated. Add
  the bread crumbs and Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper. Cover
  the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.
  
  When ready, bring the broth to a boil in a large pot over medium heat.
  Meanwhile, place a large skillet with the butter over low heat. When
  the broth reaches a boil, start shaping the meat mixture into tiny
  meat balls; a heaping tablespoon of mixture will be enough to prepare
  several. Make sure the meat balls are solid with no holes inside.
  Drop the balls into the boiling broth a few at a time, and as they
  rise to the top, tansfer them with a slotted spoon to the skillet
  containing the butter. When all the meat balls are cooked and in the
  skillet, add the mascarpone and heavy cream. Mix very well and simmer
  for 1 or 2 minutes, or until the mascarpone is completely dissolved.
  Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix very well, then transfer to
  a warmed serving platter. Serve immediately, with some Parmesan on
  the side.

      3 c  Margarine
      6 c  Oatmeal
      3 c  Flour
      1 tb Baking soda

  Put the ingredients in large bowl. Mash, squeeze, knead, etc until it
  is completely blended. Form into small balls about 1 to 1 1/2 inches
  in size. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a
  small glass and dip into white sugar, then pound the cookies flat.
  Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes. This is a good recipe
  to use when you need to get rid of some agressions because the dough
  is too heavy for most mixers. So you have to use your hands and beat
  it!! You can also use peanut butter or butterscotch chips or a
  mixture of them.

  According to NBC sportscaster Ahmad Rashad, men and women behave very
  differently in the kitchen. "When men cook, it usually looks like a
  disaster area," says the former Minnesota Viking. "And there's no
  rhyme or reason to what they make. My father sometimes cooked chicken
  for breakfast. And when he cooked, everything came out six times
  bigger than when Mom cooked."
  
  Rashad's father prepared banana pancakes for him when he was a little
  boy, back in Tacoma, Washington. Washad, in turn, makes them for his
  5-year-old daughter, Condola Phylea. On Super Bowl Sunday, he
  promises, she'll be starting off her day with a short stack.
  
  1. In a mixing bowl, using a hand or electric mixer, beat eggs for 2
  minutes until frothy. Add flour, baking powder, milk and oil. Stir in
  bananas.
  
  2. On a hot griddle, pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until
  edges become dry, about 2 minues per side. Top with banana slices.
  Drizzle with honey or maple syrup and sprinkle with pecans.

    1/2    Bay leav
      4    Sprigs parsley
      3 tb Olive oil
 
  This isn't cream of garlic soup, but it has a creamy texture. I've
  done this one and it's great.  As Julia says, "Because the garlic is
  boiled, its after-effects are at a minimum, and its flavor becomes
  exquisite, aromatic and almot undefinable."
  
  From Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. I":
  
  Drop garlic cloves in boiling water and boil for 30 seconds. Drain,
  run cold water over them and peel. Place the garlic and the rest of
  the ingredients in a 3-quart saucepan and boil slowly for 30 minutes.
  Correct seasoning.
  
  3 egg yolks 3 to 4 T. olive oil
  
  Beat the egg yolks with a wire whip in a soup tureen for a minute or
  until they are thick and sticky.  Drop by drop beat in the olive oil
  for making a mayonnaise.
  
  Rounds of hard-toasted French bread 1 cup of grated Swiss or Parmesan
  cheese
  
  Just before serving, beat a ladleful of hot soup into the egg mixture
  by droplets.  Gradually strain in the rest, beating and pressing the
  juice out of the garlic. Serve immediately, accompanied by the bread

  Pepper to taste
  
  Make a batter of the cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, shortening
  (the oil from the baking fowl is generally used) and milk. Bake in a
  hot oven (400) until done, about half an hour. Then crumble the
  bread, add one medium sized onion, chopped fine, pepper and a little
  more salt. Break in the two eggs and wet with the juice from the
  baking chicken or turkey. The liver chopped fine and added to the
  dressing improves it, as does the addition of hard cooked egg. After
  mixing thoroughly, put the mixture on one side of the baking dish and
  roast with the fowl until brown. When basting the fowl, baste the
  dressing also to keep it moist and to improve the flavor. This amount
  will serve 12 persons.

     Combine the garlic and nuts in a blender or food processor and
  puree. Add the potatoes, and puree. Pour potato mixture into a bowl
  and, using a whisk, beat in the lemon juice, a bit at a time.
  Gradually add the olive oil in a thin stream while continuing to beat
  so oil combines with potato mixture. When oil has been absorbed, add
  the egg and beat well. Giovanni de Bourbon-Sicily, French Vogue Note:
  If you omit the raw egg, you still get a nice sauce. According to an
  ancient proverb, "Garlic is as good as 10 mothers." If the latest flu
  bug has hit your house--and whose has escaped--you may be ready to
  test claims for garlic's medicinal powers.
     Since 1983, the National Library of Medicine has gathered 125
  scientific papers on the therapeutic potential of garlic. They've
  found some interesting material. It's clear that allicin, the smelly
  compound in garlic, is an antibiotic--but only if taken raw. Heat
  destroys the elements that have antibiotic properties. Raw or cooked,
  garlic can also work as a decongestant and expectorant for common
  colds and bronchitis. Regularly eating raw garlic seems to act as a
  deterrent for these ailments, according to Dr Irwin Ziment. A Dr
  Abdullah, who eats a couple of raw garlic cloves a day, claims he has
  not had a cold since 1973. Admittedly, eating raw garlic won't help
  your social life but Kyolic, a deodorized garlic compound from Japan,
  may allow you to have good health and good friends. I've also heard
  of fresh garlic imported from Japan that supposedly is deodorized. If
  any of you have found it in local stores, let us know. It would be
  interesting to hear if it lives up to the claims made for it.
     Since having the flu is no fun, this may be a good time to take
  your chances and share some pungent garlic dishes with friends and
  family--for health's sake. It's easy to add minced fresh garlic to
  hummus or tabbouleh, Mid-Eastern dishes you can buy in many deli's
  and natural food stores. If you're brave, you can try my
  grandmother's cold cure. Spread a slice of black bread with butter,
  then layer thin slivers of raw garlic all over the bread. Eat this
  and it'll cure what ails you...or keep everyone so far away that no
  germs will reach you! Aioli is a milder way to enjoy raw garlic. This
  French condiment, a sort of mayonnaise, is a puree of garlic, boiled
  potatoes, olive oil and egg. Serve it with chicken, grilled fish,
  dolloped into soup and on vegetables.

 Categories: Sauces, Condiments
      Yield: 1 Cups
 
      5    Garlic cloves
      1    Egg, at room temperature
      1 c  Olive oil, at room temp.
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Crush the garlic in a food blender. Add the egg, and blend for 15
  seconds. Very slowly add the oil through the top of the blender so
  that an emulsion can take place. Stir in the lemon juice by hand.
  Hint: To get the smell of garlic off your hands, simply rub your
  hands in used coffee grinds. End of odor. In Italy, it is common to
  eat a whole coffee bean after a big meal so that your lover will not
  be bothered by garlic.

 Categories: Household, Better
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------
      1 c  Baking soda
    1/4 c  Ammonia
      1 tb SCENT OF YOUR CHOICE:
           -perfume, lemon extract or
           -juice, VANILLA BEAN EXTRACT
           -or pine oil
     16 c  Water
 
  ** For a quick fix for a stubborn odor, here's a traditional solution
  that you can customize to your taste.
  
  Into a clean gallon size plastic jug pour baking soda, ammonia, and
  the scent of your choice. Slowly fill with warm water. Label and cap
  jug. Keep out of the reach of children. Pour small quantities of the
  solution into pretty containers with spray tops--old perfune
  containers or atomizers are ideal. Then you can leave the refresher
  on the counter in rooms where you need it frequently.
  
  To Use: Simply mist the air where unpleasant odors abound. Avoid
  spraying on or near furniture or pets. Wipe up any reside if you
  overdo, but the mist will not harm anything if you don't soak an item
  with the mist. Especially AVOID spraying directly on FINE WOOD
  FURNITURE--The ammonia, scent, or water could harm the finish. 1 gal.

      3 lb Broiler chicken
      1 c  Kecap (or ketjap) manis*
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and mashed

           Cornstarch to thicken
           -- marinade for sauce
 
  *Sweet soy sauce.
  
  **Hot pepper sauce.
  
  ***Shrimp puffs.
  
  Note:  Ingredients from Indonesia are available at many Dutch,
  Chinese, Vietnamese and Indonesian specialty stores. This...dish is
  good with Nasi Goreng (fried rice).
  
  Cut chicken into 8 pieces.  Combine remaining ingredients, except
  shrimp puffs, in large bowl.  Add chicken pieces; toss to coat.
  Marinate 2 hours at room temperature, stirring occasionally. Remove
  chicken pieces from marinade (reserving some of the marinade for
  basting and the rest for sauce).
  
  Roast, uncovered, at 400 F. for 35 to 40 minutes or until done,
  basting as needed.  If browning too quickly, cover with foil. (In
  summer, barbecue over charcoal fire.)
  
  Heat reserved marinade with cornstarch until thickened and serve as
  sauce, if desired.  Serve with shrimp puffs on the side. For these,
  simply deep-fry in hot fat or oil (375 F. on fat thermometer),
  draining at once on paper towels.  The chips will puff up as soon as
  they hit the fat.
  
  Yield: 4 servings on its own, 6 as part of an Indonesian rice table.

      Title: AJIACO
 Categories: Ethnic, Soups/stews, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 c  Unsalted chicken stock
      4    Ears yellow corn, shucked,
           Sliced into 1-inch thick
           Wheels
      3 lb Chicken, cut into bite size
           Pieces.
      2 ts Sweet paprika
      1 c  Onions finely diced
      3 c  Milk
      2 lg Yucca peeled and cut into
           Inch thick dice.
           Juice of one lime.
 
  This recipe is for a Cuban stew/soup that I used to enjoy con mucho
  gusto. This version of Ajiaco was prepared by Senora Garcia in her
  little store front restaurant on Collins Ave. in Miami Beach.
  Although this is not her exact recipe, it's the closest I could get
  to it. Ajico del Restaurant Garcia ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Melt
  the butter in a 6 qt. pot over medium heat.  Cook chicken pieces in
  the butter until no longer pink. Remove chicken with slotted spoon
  and place in in a bowl. Put onion, garlic, cayenne, and paprika in
  pot and cook while stirring, until onion is translucent and colored
  with the paprika. Add stock, milk, yuca, corn, and chicken to the
  pot. Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer,
  stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yucca is
  tender.  Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve with Cuban or
  French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden.
  
  As an alternative frozen corn on the cob will work, as well as fresh
  frozen kernels.  The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to
  this dish.
  
  If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em
  up with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims.
  
  This dish recieved rave reviews at the 1991 Blind Pass Marina Xmas
  Party.

  pot and cook while stirring, until onion is translucent and colored
  with the paprika. Add stock, milk, yucca, corn, and chicken to the
  pot. Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer,
  stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yucca is
  tender. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve with Cuban or
  French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden.
  
  As an alternative frozen corn on the cob will work, as well as fresh
  frozen kernels. The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to
  this dish.
  
  If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em
  up with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims.

      6 c  Ichiban dashi (recipe)
    1/2 c  Aka miso (red soybean paste)
           Aji-no-moto (msg)
 
    Place the ichiban dashi in a 2 quart saucepan and set a sieve over
  the pan. With the back of a large spoon, rub the miso through the
  sieve, moistening it from time to time with some of the dashi to help
  force it through more easily.
    Bring the soup to a simmer over moderate heat. Then remove from the
  heat and stir in a small pinch of MSG.
    Pour the soup into bowls, add misoshiru no-me (miso soup garnish -
  see recipes) and serve at once. If the soup seems to be seperating,
  stir to recombine it.
    Miso soups are sweeter than other Japanese soups and usually are
  served toward the end of a formal Japanese meal.

      2 lb Crab meat
 
  [I think this recipe assumes raw crabmeat to start; refer to
  instructions below about boiling crab meat and alter technique if
  using pre-cooked crab meat, perhaps by just boiling some ginger and
  cloves in small amount of water and adding a bit to flavor crab. --
  cmt]
  
  Put crab meat in boiling salted water along with ginger piece and
  cloves. Cook about 15 minutes, until meat is tender enough to flake
  with a fork. Drain, flake and set aside.
  
  In a heavy pot, heat oil to a moderate temperature and add other
  ingredients in the following sequence, stirring for a minute or so
  between each: onions, ground ginger, tomatoes, tomato paste, green
  pepper, paprika, cayenne, and dried shrimp.  Reduce heat and simmer
  for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly, until vegetables are cooked.
  Add crab meat and stir another couple of minutes to heat it through.
  Then spoon the mixture into clean crab shells or ramekins (small
  individual baking dishes).
  
  Sprinkle bread crumbs on top of each crab and toast under an oven
  broiler, being careful not to let the crumbs scorch. Garnish with egg

      Title: AKPITH (CORN/MAIZE & BEAN FLOUR SNACK)
 Categories: Snacks, Breads, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Corn/maize meal
    1/2 c  Soy flour
  1 1/2 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts Chili powder (optional)
           Sugar to taste
      1 c  Water
           Oil
           Salt and pepper
 
  Corn/maize was introduced to Africa from Latin America by the
  Portuguese, mainly to provision their slave ships. The grain was
  quickly accepted because it grew rapidly and undemanding in
  cultivation. The name 'maize' comes from 'mahiz', the word used by
  the Caribbean Taino Indians from whom the Europeans probably first
  learned about the crop. in North American the English settlers were
  shown it by local Indians. 'Corn' was a general name given to any
  grain, so they called it simply 'Indian corn'.
  
  Columbus noted that maize was "most tasty boiled, roasted or ground
  into flour".  And in southern Ghana today a common food is 'kenkey',
  fermented corn/maize flour balls, wrapped in corn/maize leaves and
  steamed. Akpith, this recipe, is more straightforward.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== In a large saucepan, boil the water and then
  in half of the corn/maize meal and all the soy flour to make a thick
  porridge. Add the baking powder, chili powder if using and sugar;
  season.
  
  Cook this for 10 minutes over a low heat, stirring constantly. Then
  remove the pan and set aside to cool for 10 minutes or so.
  
  At this point, mix in the remaining corn/maize meal and combine
  thoroughly, adding water to produce a stiff dough.
  
  Now pour enough oil into a pan or wok to give a depth of around 2
  inches (5 cms), and heat up.  While it is warming mould the dough
  into balls about 1 inch (2.5 cms) in diameter.
  
  With the oil sizzling hot, slide 4 or 5 balls carefully into the pan
  and cook for 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown.

      1 kg Chicken Breasts
      4 lg Eggs
      2 c  Flour
      2 c  Bread Crumbs(Krummies etc)
 
  All MEASUREMENTS and CURRENCY mentioned below in in METRIC and
  Australian currency. In 1 kg you usually get 3 breasts so cut them in
  half as described below and 2 halfs usually make a filling meal.Costs
  about $10 to serve a family since adult can have 2 halfs with mashed
  potato and mini carrots etc and children can have 1. This is my first
  Recipe so here goes.
  
  Cut Chicken Breasts down the middle into 2 parts. Use Spiked Mallet
  to beat chicken till its a mit thinner so it cooks better.Also trim
  any skin or get skinless breasts to reduce amount of calories.
  
  Get 3 plates.On the first plate sift flour on to plate. On second
  plate,beat eggs and pour onto a deep plate. On third put the bread
  crumbs on it.
  
  Dip or cover breasts in flour.Shake off excess.Coat breast with egg
  either by brushing on or dipping on plate.Then cover in bread crumbs
  and put on plate.
  
  On this is done you are ready to cook them.Now I usually cook mine so
  that the bread crumbs brown but dont get burnt so the schnitzel is
  very soft.Since I'm not an experienced cook but have to do the
  cooking for the family (Im 15) I dont know if Im undercooking them or
  what but they taste best that way.Just cook them and when the look
  cooked cut in half and if the meat is white(like chicken sould look
  not the colour of an uncooked fillet) they are cooked.I cook on
  medium heat in a frypan with some oil. Serving Suggestions: In the
  Colder months this meal is best served with Mashed potato and gravy
  as well as carrots and any other vegetables you like.
  
  In the Warm months my very favourite is a Schnitzel Burger. I put the
  lettuce on the bottom,Beetroot next,then the scnitzel,then a thin
  pineapple ring,and mayo.Excellent in summer months.2 of these make a
  filling and tasty meal.
  
  Well there you go.And comments and critisism would be appreciated.

      2 tb Plus 2 teaspoons sugar
    1/2    Vanilla bean, split
      3    Coriander seeds
      1    Whole clove
    1/4 ts Five-spice powder
           Zest of 1 lime
           Zest of 1/2 lemon
    1/2 ts Chopped fresh ginger
      1    Sprig of fresh mint (OPT)
      1 tb Fresh lime juice
      1    Pineapple
      1    Mango
      2    Large kiwis
      2    Passion fruits
 
  And ideal fruit salad or dessert for Winter, because the tropical
  fruits are available year-round and ripen naturally. The riper and
  more fragrant the fruit, the better the salad. 
  In a small saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups water with the sugar, vanilla
  bean, coriander seeds, clove, five-spice powder, lime and lemon
  zests, ginger, and mint, if using. Simmer over moderate heat for 10
  minutes. Set aside to cook.  Then stir in the lime juice. (The syrup
  can be made up and refrigerated for up to a week before serving the
  salad.) 
  Slice off the top and the rind from the pineapple; quarter it
  lengthwise. Reserve 3 of the quarters for another use. Slice 1 of the
  quarters crosswise 1/8-inch thick. Using a sharp paring knife, peel
  the mango and slice lengthwise, parallel to the pit on both sides,
  into disks 1/8-inch thick.  Slice each mango disk in half lengthwise.
  Peel the kiwis and halve lengthwise.  Cut each half lengthwise into
  thin wedges. 
  Divide the fruit evenly and arrange in each of 4 shallow soup bowls,
  overlapping the slices to form a decorative pattern. Strain the
  reserved syrup and divide equally among the 4 servings. Cover with
  plastic wrap and refirgerate for at least 1 or up to 4 hours. Just
  before serving, halve the passion fruits crosswise. Using a teaspoon,
  scoop the pulk out of each half onto the fruit in each bowl. 

      2 lb Stew meat
      1 md Onion
      1 cn Tomato sauce
      2    Cloves garlic
      2 tb Of chili powder
      2    Jalapeno chili's
      2 c  Pinto beans
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
   Trim the fat from the stew meat, cut into bite sized chunks and
  brown it. Chop the onion and the jalapeno chili. Smash the garlic.
  Throw every thing but the beans into a pot, add water and simmer
  until meat is tender.
   Put the beans into a pot with water and bring to a boil, turn the
  heat down and simmer till the beans are done.
   Eat the chili and stomp the hell out of the beans.
   Don't confuse this with "Rebel Chile" which also has the beans
  stomped out of it.
   I brought this recipe back from Mexico and it was said to be the one
  that Mexico used when they taught Texans how to make chili at the
  Alamo. I understand that to this day Texans do not put beans in chili.
  
  TL: If it hasn't got a bean it must be Texas.

  until creamy and measure out what is called for in the
  recipe.Replenish starter with equal amounts of flour and water. Store
  in the fridge and bring to room temp before using. It says to allow

    1/2 ts Alum
      2 qt Water
  3 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 pt White vinegar
    1/2 ts Oil of cloves
    1/2 ts Oil of cinnamon
 
  Cut kelp in 12 inch lengths and split bulbs.  Remove dark surface
  layer with a vegetable parer.  Soak 2 hours in brine solution
  prepared by dissolving 1 cup salt in 2 gallons water. Care must be
  taken to keep kelp covered with brine.  Remove kelp from brine and
  wash thoroughly with cold water.
  
  Cut kelp into 1 inch cubes and soak in alum solution (1/2 teaspoon
  alum to 2 quarts water) for 15 minutes. Drain and wash in cold water;
  drain again. Place in enamel kettle and cover with boiling water.
  Cook only until kelp can be pierced with a fork.  Drain.
  
  Combine sugar, vinegar and oils; boil 2 minutes; pour over cooked
  kelp. Let stand ovenight in an enamel kettle or crock. In the morning
  drain off syrup and reheat to boiling point. Pour back over kelp and
  allow to stand 24 hours.  The third morning, heat both kelp and syrup
  to boiling point. Pack in hot sterilized jars and seal while hot.
  
  NOTE:  The giant kelp is easily recognized by the floating bulb
  attached to a long, hollow stem rooted to the bottom of a shallow bay
  or channel. Gather during June, July and August when the kelp is in
  its prime. Use only the ones rooted to the bottom.  The kelp is
  washed, peeled and used the same as green tomatoes or cucumbers for
  pickles and relishes.

  oven preheated to 300 with a pan of water on floor of oven and rack
  as near as possible in middle of oven. Bake about 2-1/2 hours for
  medium-sized loaves watching carefully to see that they do not brown
  to quickly. Test with toothpick. Remove from oven, turn pans on sides
  and allow to set for a few minutes before taking from pans. When cold
  drip 2 tbsp. of wine over each cake. As soon as it is absorbed, wrap
  tightly in cellophane freezer paper and store in refrigerator or
  freezer. They improve with age.

 Categories: Game, Native, Canadian, Sauces, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Licorice fern root
      2 tb Gewurztraminer icewine
    3/4 c  Water
      3 c  Dried alder cones
      2    Wild grouse breasts, bone in
           -and skinless
           Juniper & Salal Berry Sauce:
  1 1/3 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  B.C. Pinot Blanc wine
  3 1/2 c  Salal Berries
  1 1/2 tb Maple syrup
  1 1/2 tb Black peppercorns
      8    Juniper berries
  1 1/2 tb Balsamic vinegar
 
  Recipe from Northern Bounty: A Celebration of Canadian Cuisine. The
  ISBN is 0-394-22431-0. Recipe by Sinclair Philip, owner of the Sooke
  Harbour House on Vancouver Island.  Sinclair believes in local
  ingredients, freshness and learning about and using wild ingredients
  from the native peoples. His restaurant has vegetable and herb
  gardens full of plants transplanted from the bush for use in the
  kitchen. At Sooke, chefs prepare this dish with a salad of foraged
  wild greens and flowers: amaranth, chicory, chickweed, lamb's
  quarters, orache, shepherd's purse, and sorrel.
  
  Alder: a deciduous tree, member of the birch family with woody cone
  like fruits. Common in swamps and mountainous areas. [ I am going to
  try black spruce cones- our commonest local tree. (Update: this was a
  terrible idea- bitter tarry smoked taste) If that doesn't work I can
  fall back on store bought fruit wood chips or do a Chinese Tea
  Smoke.- JW]
  
  Licorice Fern: I have no idea what it's geographic range is or what
  flavor it's root would impart. Based on it's name I am going to try
  diced Fennel bulb, Fennel seed or a _wee_ bit of Star Anise stewed in
  Port instead.-JW
  
  Salal Berries: Salal is a low [up to 2 meter] evergreen shrub of the
  Heath family native to California, B.C. and Alaska with white to pink
  urn shaped flowers and round purple berries which turn black. [There
   are none locally so I will be experimenting with cranberries or
  black currants.- JW]
  
  Directions:
  
  In a small covered sauce pan, gently simmer fern root in icewine and
  water for 20 min. Pour into a glass jar, seal and let stand at room
  temp for 12 hours. Strain into a small saucepan and boil, uncovered,
  on high until reduced to a thick syrup. Set aside.
  
  Heat alder cones in a large aluminum foil lined sauce pan over high
  heat until they smoulder. Reduce heat to low; place grouse breasts
  directly on top of the smouldering cones. Lightly brush the breasts
  with the fern root glaze; cover pan tightly. Smoke breasts for 3
  hours or until cooked but not dry. Remove the meat from the bone and
  serve with Juniper-Salal Berry Sauce.
  
  For the sauce: Pour 1 cup water and the wine into the bottom of a per-
  forated double boiler. Place the salal berries in the top section.
  Cover; simmer gently for two hours. Gently press berries with a
  rubber spatula to extract remaining juice. Discard berries; reserving
  syrup in the bottom of the double boiler.
  
  To the salal syrup, add the maple syrup, peppercorns, juniper berries,
  remaining water and balsamic vinegar. Bring to the boil and
  immediately remove from the heat; let stand an hour before returning
  to the heat. Cook, uncovered, until slightly thickened. Refrigerate
  until needed.

      Title: ALEECHA
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Onion; sliced
     10 cl Garlic; sliced thin
      2 c  Carrots; sliced thin
      1 c  Water
      3 tb Corn oil
      1 ts Tumeric; ground
      1 ea Fresh hot green peppers
           -halved, to 3 peppers
      1 lb Cabbage; coarsely sliced
      1 ts Queman; see note
      1 tb Tomato paste
      1 ts Salt; to taste
      1 lb Potatoes; cut like french
           -fries
 
  Aleecha is a mixed vegetable stew. Quemam contains an ingredient not
  found in the US. I'd substitute dry berebere. In dry pan over
  moderate low heat, stir fry onion, garlic, and carrots for 2 mins.
  Add 1/2c of the water and cook  5 mins longer. Add the oil and
  continue to simmer.
  
  Add the tumeric, chilies, and cabbage.  Cover the pan and steam to
  reduce the bulk for 2 mins.  Stir well and add the quemam, tomato
  paste, salt and the potatoes.
  
  Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins.  Add the remaining water and
  simmer for 5 minutes more to soften the potatoes and thicken the
  sauce somewhat.
  
  Serve at room temperature with Injeera.

      Title: ALEKSANDER TORTE / RASPBERRY-FILLED PASTRY ST
 Categories: Cakes, Cookies
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter, chilled and
           Cut into bits
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      3 tb Sugar
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 c  Raspberry preserves (12 oz)
      2 tb Soft butter
      2 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/4 c  Cold water
      2 ts Lemon juice
 
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the chilled butter, 3 cups of the
  flour and the sugar and, with your fingertips, rub until the mixture
  resembles flakes of coarse meal. Beat in the egg and continue to mix
  until the pastry is smooth.  Shape it into a ball, wrap it in wax
  paper, and refrigerate 1 hour, or until the dough is form.
  
  With the back of a spoon, rub the preserves through a fine sieve set
  over a 1-quart saucepan, then cook over moderate heat, stirring
  constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they thicken into a thin
  puree. Set aside off the heat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 250F.  Cut the chilled pastry in half and shape
  each half into a rectangle.  One half at a time, roll the pastry
  between two sheets of lightly floured wax paper into a rectangle
  approximately 10 inches wide and 15 inches long.  With a pastry
  brush, coat each of 2 cookie sheets with 1 tablespoon of butter and
  sprinkle them with flour, tipping the sheets from side to side to
  coat them evenly. Then invert the sheets and tap them against a hard
  surface to dislodge any excess flour. Peel off the top sheets of wax
  paper and use the bottom ones to lift the 2 rectangles of pastry onto
  the 2 cookie sheets. Peel off the remaining sheets of wax paper. Bake
  40 minutes, or until the pastry begins to turn a pale gold.  Watch
  carefully for any sign of burning and regulate the heat accordingly.
  
  With a metal spatula, spread the raspberry puree evenly over one
  sheet of the pastry, covering it completely and smoothly. Slide the
  second sheet of pastry gently onto the first.
  
  With a spoon stir the sugar, water and lemon juice together in a large
  mixing bowl to form a thin paste. Spread the icing over the top layer
  of pastry with the spatula, and set the cake aside to cool to room
  temperature.  With a small, sharp knife or pastry wheel, slice the
  Aleksander Torte into strips 1 inch wide and 2 inches long, cutting
  the ends on the diagonal.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
      1 pk Dried yeast
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Cumin seed, ground
      1 c  Plus 3 oz. lukewarm water
 
     1) Place the flour, yeast, salt, and ground cumin in a large mixing
  bowl.  Blend well.  Add the water and mix the dough for 2-3 minutes,
  until all the water is absorbed and evenly distributed. The dough
  will be damp and very sticky, but no internal dry areas should appear
  by the end of the mixing.  If they do, mix a few minutes more, or add
  a little more water and mix again.
  
     2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsps. flour
  over the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured
  surface for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and
  only slightly sticky.  Add more flour if needed (e.g. in humid
  weather). Let the dough rest for 2 minutes more.
  
     3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30
  seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
  towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
  hours; the dough should almost triple in size.
  
     4) Flour the top of the dough lightly, punch it down, and remove
  the dough from the mixing bowl.  Form the dough into a rectangular
  loaf and place in a well greasad loaf pan, 9-1/4 in. by 5-1/4 in. by
  2-3/4 in. Cover with a towel and let rise 1 hr., until nicely risen.
  
     5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until
  browned on top; the bottom of the bread should sound hollow when
  tapped with the finger.  Let the bread cool, then serve.

 Categories: Stew chili, Beans
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
 
        1 lb (2 cups) small navy beans --
  :          soaked
      1/4 c  olive oil
        1 lg onion -- finely diced
        3 sm dried red chilies -- seeded
       15    garlic cloves -- minced
        1 TB sweet paprika
      1/4 ts freshly ground black pepper
        4 ts ground cumin
        6 oz tomato paste -- canned
        2    tomatoes -- coarsely
  :          chopped
        7 c  water -- or
  :          vegetable broth
        2    bay leaves
      1/8 ts cayenne -- or to taste
       20    sprigs fresh flat-leaf
  :          parsley -- chopped
    2 1/2 ts salt
       10    sprigs fresh cilantro --
  :          chopped
  :          Cider vinegar -- or
  :          red wine vinegar --
  :          optional
  
  LOUBIA is an Algerian speciality that gets its flavor from DERSA, a
  spicy blend of ground dried red chilies (use New Mexican in the US),
  garlic, and ground cumin. Dersa is a predominant season ing in the
  cuisine. A dash of vinegar is traditionally added to each bowl of
  Loubia on serving.
  
  Soak and drain the beans. Set aside. SOAKING BEANS: Rinse and pick
  over the beans and soak them overnight in a bowl of water to cover.
  Drain and proceed with the recipe. For the quick-soak method, place
  the beans in a large soup pot and add 10 cups of hot water. Bring
  them to a rolling boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and let
  the beans stand in the cooking water for at least 1 hour, and
  preferable longer. Drain the beans and proceed with the recipe. The
  older the beans, the longer they will take to cook. (She recommends
  adding salt to the cooking water: up to 2 teaspoons per pound of
  dried beans.)
  
  In a large soup pop over medium high heat, heat the oil, and cook the
  onion, stirring occasionally, until tender; 6 to 8 minutes. Add the
  chilies, garlic, paprika, pepper, and cumin. Cook, stirring, for 2 to
  3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until the mixture
  thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and 1 cup of the water
  or broth and bring to a boil. Add the beans, the remaining 6 cups
  water or broth, the bay leaves, cayenne, and
       10    of the parsley sprigs tied together with cotton string.
  Mince the remaining parsley and set aside. Lower the heat to medium
  low, cover, and cook the beans until tender, 1 to 2 hours.
  
  Before serving, discard the chilies, bay leaves, and tied parsley.
  Season with salt. Stir in the reserved minced parsley and cilantro.
  Serve hot with vinegar on the side, if you like.

      1    Can cooked chickpeas, drain
    3/4    To 1 lb. pkg couscous
      2 lg Onions chopped
      1    Carrot sliced
      1    Gr bell pepper, sliced
      1    Eggplant,sliced, salted &
           Rinsed
      1 lb Lamb, cut in 2 inch cubes
      1    Chicken cut up in 8 parts
      3 tb Oil
      1    Pimento
      4    Tomatoes, seeded, chopped
      2 ts Papriks
           Salt
      7 oz Fresh string beans or peas
      9 oz Can artichoke bottoms
           Drained
           Cayenne pepper
      4 oz Butter
 
  Place couscous in shallow pan with 4 cups water. Swirl and pour off
  water immediately in a sieve. Rub couscous well between hands and
  drop back into pan, making sure couscous is lump free. Let this dry
  while preparing remainders. Fry onions garlic, pepper, carrot and
  eggplant with chicken and lamb in oil. Then add chickpeas( if using
  dried ones ) and enough water to cover. Add pimento and salt and
  pepper to taste,Bring to a boil and fasten colander over kettle to
  fit snugly. Spoon couscous into colander and let steam for 45
  minutes, then dump couscous back into pan to let dry again. Add
  tomatoes, beans or peas and cook another 1/2 hour. Now attach
  colander and let couscous steam another 15 minutes. Add artichoke,
  canned chickpeas to the stew.  Cook a few minutes longer. Add some
  butter to the couscous and place couscous shaped into a cone on a
  serving platter. surround by meat and vegetables. Note: this is only
  one version of many different types of couscous preparation. It is
  thought that the name of this grain comes from the soft rumbling
  noise that the couscous makes in a steamer. There is a special
  couscous pot but a colander can suffice.

      Title: ALHEIRAS DE MIRANDELA
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 15 Units
 
      3 lb Lean beef*
  1 1/2 lb Calf meat
    1/2 lb Chicken
    1/2 lb Turkey
    1/2 lb Rabbit
  1 1/2 lb Day old wheat bread
    1/4 lb Ham (optional)
      4    Garlic cloves
      4 ts Olive oil
      2 oz Pork drippings**
           Paprika, salt and
           -piripiri to taste
     10    Feet tripe casing
 
  *    Or lean pork, or a mixture of both, for cost reasons. **
  Probably a modern addition, or replacement for suet. You may change
  the proportions of chicken/turkey/rabbit - it may be all chicken,
  etc., provided the total amount remains the same. You can use
  partridge, quail, duck, and so on... Boil the meats together long
  enough to make the bones separate from the meat by themselves.
  Reserve the resulting broth and set meats aside. In a large bowl
  place the thinly sliced bread and add the reserved broth. Cover with
  a towel and, as soon as the bread is soft enough, mash it with an
  wooden spoon. Add the mashed garlic and ground piripiri, paprika and
  a little salt. Add the meats cut in very little pieces. Mix
  thoroughly. When everything is completely mixed add the olive oil and
  the pork drippings, hot. Fill the casing using a suitable funnel. Tie
  each 'alheira' so that it's about 8" long, with the filling
  concentrated in the middle section, leaving the ends almost empty.
  Smoke for 2 or 3 hours a day, for a week. Tie both ends together
  before selling or using - the 'alheira' should be U shaped. A typical
  way of serving 'alheiras' is frying them in hot oil, and presenting
  them with fried eggs and potato chips. Some add broccoli as a side
  dish.

      1 c  Butter flavored Crisco or 2
           Sticks (1/4 lb
    2/3 c  Milk
      1 tb Vanilla
 
  Mix sugar and Crisco together.  Heat milk until hot on finger. (Do not
  boil.)  Add half of the milk to sugar ~ Crisco mixture and beat 2
  minutes. Add rest of milk and beat 8 minutes longer (a total of 10
  minutes all together). The beating breaks up the sugar granules to a
  whipped cream consistency, but is a butter type.
  
  To make a whipped cream frosting, use white Crisco instead of
  butter-flavored. (This is Audrey's (my sister-in-laws recipe.) (I use
  these often as I don't always have confectioners sugar on hand.)

      1 ea Parsley to taste
      1 ea Italian seasoning to taste
      1 pn Black pepper
 
  It was good, but much more of a stew than a sauce. Next time I make
  it, I'll use real onions, and two cans of tomatoes, and have
  containers ready to freeze most of it... my freezer is full these
  days. In summer, fresh tomatoes (and probably zucchini) would be
  good...

 Categories: Buckwheat, Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  The many forms of Buckwheat!:
  
  Buckwheat Seed:  It's a fruit, not a grain.  Planted around the world.
  Triangular hard hull.  Fresh seeds can be sprouted; ready-to-eat in
  about 5 days.
  
  Kasha:  Hulled and roasted to bring out distinctive, nutlike flavor.
  Packaged four ways; whole, coarse, medium, fine.
  
  Whole Buckwheat Groats:  Hulled and unroasted. Mild-flavored. Better
  than barley or rice!
  
  Cream of Buckwheat:  100% pure groats milled to the size of sesame
  seeds. Look like corn grits and other "cream of..." cereals, but
  taste better.
  
  Buckwheat Flour:  Both light and whole buckwheat flour are 100%
  buckwheat. Gluten-free.  For fiber and flavor, each contains very
  finely milled particles of buckwheat hulls (more in whole flour).

MMMMM-------------------HOW TO STORE CHOCOLATE------------------------
 
     Store chocolate tightly wrapped or covered in a cool, dry place or
  in the refrigerator.  If refrigerated, let it warm to room
  temperature before using.
     Occaionally, there may be a slight graying or "bloom" on
  chocolate. This does not alter the quality or flavor and when used in
  a recipe, the chocolate will regain its color.

MMMMM-------------------HOW TO MELT CHOCOLATE------------------------
 
    Always melt chocolate with gentle heat because it scorches easily.
  If chocolate is to be melted alone, make certain that the container
  and utensils are absolutely dry; a tiny drop of moisture will cause
  the chocolate to become lumpy and stiff.  If this should happen, stir
  in one teaspoon of vegetable shortening for each ounce of chocolate.
  Remember that unsweetened chocolate liquifies when melted, but
  semisweet and baking chocolate will hold their shapes until stirred.
  For faster melting, cut or chop chocolate into smaller pieces. To
  melt chocolate, place it in a heavy saucepan over low heat and stir
  until melted. Or, place chocolate in top of a double boiler and melt
  over hot water, stirring until smooth.
    To melt chocolate in a microwave oven, place a 1-ounce square in a
  1-cup glass measure.  Microwave, uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for
  1 to 2 minutes or until chocolate is almost melted. Stir until
  completely melted and smooth.  Add 10 seconds for each additional
  ounce of chocolate. To melt chocolate morsels in a microwave oven,
  place 1 cup chocolate morsels in a 2-cup measure.  Microwave,
  uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for 2 to 4 minutes or until morsels
  are glossy. Stir until smooth. Formatted by Rose Capoccia drnd29a

MMMMM--------------------CHOCOLATE GARNISHES-------------------------
 
  CHOCOLATE LEAVES:  Select non-poisonous leaves such as mint or rose
  leaves. Wash the leaves and pat dry with paper towels. Melt 1 or 2
  (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot water in a double
  boiler; let cool slightly.  Using a small spatula, spread a thin
  layer of chocolate on the back of each leaf.  Place leaves on a wax
  paper-lined cookie sheet, chocolate side up; freeze until chocolate
  is firm, about 10 minutes. Grasp leaf at stem end and carefully peel
  away from chocolate. Chill leaves until ready to use.
  
  CHOCOLATE CURLS:  Melt 4 (1-ouce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot
  water in a double bliler.  Pour chocolate out into a wax paper-lined
  cookie sheet. Spread chocolate with a spatula into a 3-inch-wide
  strip. Smooth top with a spatula.  Chill chocolate until it feels
  slightly tacky but not firm.  (If too hard, curls will break; if too
  soft, chocolate will not curl.)  Gently pull a vegetable peeler
  across chocolate until curls form. Transfer curls to a tray by
  inserting a wooden pick in end of curl. Chill curls until ready to
  use. CHOCOLATE-DIPPED FRUIT: Make sure fruit is completely dry before
  dipping. Melt 4 (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot vater
  in a double boiler; transfer to a small bowl, and let cool slightly.
  Grasp fruit by stem and dip in chocolate, turning to coat the bottom
  of the fruit. Allow excess to drip back into bowl. Lay fruit on side
  on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet. Allow fruit to stand at room
  temperature until chocolate hardens or place in refrigerator about 10
  minutes. Don't store coated fruit in refrigerator; the chocolate
  coating will sweat when returned to room temperature and will lose
  its sheen. CHOCOLATE CUTOUTS: Melt 6 (1-ounce) squares semisweet
  chocolate over hot water in a double boiler; cool slightly. Line a
  cookie sheet with aluminum foil; pour the chocolate onto the cookie
  sheet, and gently shake it until chocolate is smooth and level and
  about 1/8-inch thick. Let stand until partially set. Press a cookie
  cutter half-way through the chocolate to outline shapes. Remove the
  cutter, and let stand until chocolate is firm. When hard, reposition
  the cutter over the oulines, and press down to cut smoothly. Lift the
  cutter up, and remove the cutout by gently pressing through the
  cutter with a small wooden utensil (fingers will leave prints on
  chocolate). GRATED CHOCOLATE: You can grate unsweetened, semisweet,
  or milk chocolate to sprinkle on top of pies, etc. It's easiest done
  in a food processor, but you can grate it by hand. When grating by
  hand, hold chocolate with a paper towel or wax paper so heat from
  your hand will not soften or melt the chocolate.

 Categories: Chocolate, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
    MELTING CHOCOLATE
  
    Chocolate scorches easily, so always melt it over hot - not boiling
  ~ water.  It is best to use a double boiler, but you can improvise by
  using a c  or bowl in a small saucepan over very gentle heat. The
  water must be kept below simmering to prevent steam from curling up
  and hitting the chocolate. If steam gets into the melted chocolate it
  will immediately thicken the mixture to a stiff mass. If this does
  happen, however, you can rescue the chocolate by softening it again.
  To do this, add 1-2 tb of vegetable shortening (never use butter as
  it contains moisture which will cause the chocolate stiffen even
  more!) to the chocolate and stir vigorously.  You can also melt
  chocolate directly over very low heat in a heavy gauge saucepan, but
  you must watch the mixture carefully.
  
    HOW TO MAKE CHOCOLATE CURLS
  
    Use a vegetable peeler with a long narrow blade and a chunk or bar
  of chocolate.  Warm chocolate and blade slightly. Be sure your peeler
  is absolutely dry. Draw the peeler along the smooth surface of the
  chocolate.
  
  HOW TO GRATE CHOCOLATE
  
    Be sure that the block of chocolate is cool and firm. Grate on hand
  grater, cleaning the grater often so that the chocolate doesn't clog
  the surface of the blade. You cn use a blender, but be sure to cut the
  chocolate into sm pieces first.
  
  HOW TO STORE CHOCOLATE
  
    Chocolate should be stored in a cool, dry place at a temperature of
  about 60F. If the chocolate becomes too warm, the cocoa butter rises
  to the surface and forms a dusty gray film known as "bloom." This
  "bloom" is not harmful and, once the chocolate is melted, it returns
  to its natural rich brown color.  If you do store chocolate in the
  refrigerator or freezer, take in out and let it stand until it
  returns to room temperature before you use it in a recipe. Chocolate
  is very sensitive to sudden changes of temperature and you will not
  get the best results if you do not treat it with respect.

      Title: ALL SOUTH BARBEQUE RUB
 Categories: Sauces, Rubs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Salt
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Brown sugar
      2 tb Ground cumin
      2 tb Chile powder
      2 tb Freshly cracked black
           Pepper
      1 tb Cayenne pepper
      4 tb Paprika
 
  The rub is the second most important part of the BBQ process, next to
  the smoking technique. There are two main concepts to keep in mind
  when formulating your rub. The proportion of salt should be great
  enough to trigger osmosis and begin to draw the moisture from the
  surface of the meat, and (some may disagree with this) the proportion
  of sugar should not be excessive because it will caramelize and burn
  during smoking leaving a bitter taste.  However, since sugar
  contributes to osmosis, it is an important component and shouldn't be
  eliminated.
  
  Beyond that, your rub should only be limited by your imagination.
  Other ingredients to consider can include paprika, cumin, garlic
  powder, onion powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chile powder,
  oregano, sage or whatever sounds good to you.
  
  I like to keep my rub in a shaker for easy application. Rub should be
  applied at least the night before smoking. Anything longer, up to
  three days, is better. Shake the rub over the entire surface of the
  meat to be smoked.  Use a generous amount at first and then, as it
  starts to get moist and adhere, add more. I don't think it's
  necessary to "rub" it in. I find that that only results in uneven
  distribution, and besides, it stains your hands.  Wrap the meat
  loosely in butcher paper and leave in the fridge until a couple of
  hours before smoking.
  
  I find rubs to be far more useful than marinades especially for large
  pieces of meat such as briskets and pork butts. For cuts such as
  these, the internal and external fat melt through the meat during
  cooking to keep it moist.  I believe that the texture of the meat is
  improved by drawing out excess moisture, before cooking, through
  osmosis. The dry surface of the meat and the rub itself combine to
  produce a flavorful and attractive crust on the finished product.
  Unless it is thoroughly blotted dry on the surface, marinated meat
  won't color properly.

      Title: ALL-AMERICAN COLE SLAW
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Green cabbage; quartered,
           -   cored, and shredded fine
      3 tb Vinegar; cider, malt, distld
    2/3 c  Mayonnaise
      1    Onion, small; grated (optnl)
      2    Carrot, medium; grated
    1/4 ts Salt
 
     In a large mixing bowl, toss the cabbage with the vinegar and salt.
  Grate the carrots and optional onion directly into the bowl. Add the
  mayonnaise and toss well.
     The slaw can be served immediately, but it is much better -- more
  melded and tender -- if allowed to stand and tossed occasionally for
  30 minutes to 1 hour. For a very limp slaw, refrigerate several hours
  or overnight.
  
  ^^^^^^^^^^
     The law on cole slaw is cabbage and vinegar.  All the rest is
  interpretation.  Adjust the recipe to taste: Add more mayonnaise,
  substitute sour cream or yogurt for some (but not all) of the
  mayonnaise, or add a supplement of one or the other. Add diced green
  and/or red pepper if you have one, celery or caraway seeds if you
  like that kind of thing, or shredded celery for an extra fresh taste.

      Title: ALL-AMERICAN PIE PASTRY
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Frozen lard or shortening
           - cut into bits
      3 tb Ice water
 
  To ensure a tender crust, this recipe should not be doubled.
  Thoroughly freezing the lard or shortening will give you the flakiest
  crust.
  
  PLACE THE FLOUR AND SALT in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 2-3
  times. Scatter the lard or shortening over the flour mixture.
  Sprinkle with the water and process about 5 seconds or until dough
  just begins to form. Shape into a ball, then flatten it slightly.
  Dust lightly with flour and place in the center of a 2-gallon-size
  plastic storage bag. It may be refrigerated at this point up to 40
  minutes. With the storage bag open and the dough circle centered in
  the bag, roll the dough into a circle that almost touches the edges
  of the bag. Cut and discard the top sheet of the plastic bag so that
  the dough is lying on the bottom sheet. Flip onto the pie plate; peel
  the plastic off and discard. Cut the pastry so it hangs about an inch
  over the rim. Lightly press the overhanging pastry under (between the
  pastry and the pie tin). Pinch or crease the edges of the pastry in a
  zigzag or fluted pattern. This is not only decorative, it also acts
  as a wall to keep the filling in. Yield: 1 single-crust 8- to 10-inch
  pie shell.

      Title: ALL-DAY-LONG CROCKPOT BEEF
 Categories: Crockpot, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Beef roast; * see note
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
    1/2 pk Onion soup mix
      2 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Steak sauce
      3    Carrots; sliced
      2    Celery stalks; diced
      1    Green bell pepper; chopped
      1    Yellow onion
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Tomato juice
 
  Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 8:00 * Use any cut of
  beef roast desired.
  
       1. Cut beef roast into serving-sized portions. Use more beef if
  you need more than 6 servings. Brown beef in a bit of vegetable oil,
  although you can skip this step if rushed for time.
       2. Slice onion and separate into rings. Dice the peeled carrots,
  dice the celery and slice the peppers into thin strips or circles.
  Place these into bottom of crockpot. Sprinkle the beef pieces with
  fresh ground black pepper, minced garlic and the onion soup mix.
  Place on top of the vegetables.
       3. Mix the steak sauce and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl
  with about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup tomato juice. Pour this over the
  meat.
       4. Turn the crockpot to high for 30 minutes, or, if you're in a
  hurry, skip this step. Turn to low, cover and cook for 7-9 hours.
  
  * Keep the crockpot covered as much as possible throughout cooking
  time. A crockpot can be used to cook this type of meal for a varied
  amount of time, depending on your schedule. It is not important that
  you take the meat and vegetables out at a specific amount of time.
  One or two hours either way usually makes no difference.
  
       When ready to serve, dip meat and vegetables out of pot with a
  slotted spoon. Use the liquid as is or turn crockpot to high and
  thicken liquid with a little flour or cornstarch.

 Categories: Potatoes, Sauces, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 sm Or 1 lg potato
      1 c  Water
      1    Brown onion -- coursely
           Minced
           Coursely ground black
           Pepper
           Olive oil -- amt. opt

           (such as Vegex
           Or Organic Gourmet
           Vegetable
           Broth concentrate) -- to
           Taste
 
  (Optional: Any combination of stuff like poppy seeds, celery seeds,
  toasted sesame seeds, Lawry's Seasoned Salt) Microwave the potato(s)
  for about 8 minutes more or less, depending on your potato(s) and
  your microwave. Then, put them in a blender (do not peel) with the
  water and whirl until you have a puree. Set aside. In a hot skillet
  (I use my trusty electric wok), saute the onion in the olive oil
  until it's the way you like it. Pour in the potato puree, and moosh
  it around, cooking the hell out of it until it's also the way you
  like it (is there any other way?), adding seasonings to taste. That's
  it!  This is great over steamed veggies or grains or biscuits or
  toast  or eggs or corn on the cob or spinach even potatos! You could
  try it over ice cream or fruit salad but you'd be really weird.

      Title: ALLBRAN FRUIT LOAF
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Dried mixed fruit
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  All-bran
      1 c  Flour
 
  Soak first four ingredients together for at least 1 hour. Mix the
  flour in well, and put into a greased lined loaf tin and bake for
  approximately 1 hour at 180C (GM4 375F). The cake is delicious, and
  served in slices with a little margarine on. If you wrap it in foil
  and keep for a few days (if it lasts that long) the flavour gets even
  better. The all-bran is available in the UK as Kellogg's AllBran.
  It's sort of little sticks of high-fibre bran stuff. If you can't get
  it in the US, I don't know what the equivalent is (not having been to
  the US myself).

      Title: ALLIED RECIPES FOR CHAO TOM
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  ROASTED RICE POWDER (THINH) Roasted rice powder is used as a
  flavoring and binding agent in various recipes throughout this book.
  It is necessary to soak the rice first in order to obtain a deep
  golden color after roasting. Soaking also makes the rice easier to
  grind. 1/2 cup raw glutinous rice Soak the glutinous rice in warm
  water for 1 hour. Drain. Place the rice in a small skillet over
  moderate heat.  Toast the rice, stirring constantly with chopsticks
  or a wooden spoon, until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes.
  Transfer the roasted rice to a spice grinder or blender and process
  to a fine powder (the powder should resemble saw dust). Sift the
  ground rice through a very fine sieve into a bowl. Discard the grainy
  bits. Store the rice powder in a tightly covered jar in your
  refrigerator and use as needed. It will keep for up to 3 months.
  Yield: 1 cup. SCALLION OIL (HANH LA PHI): Many Vietnamese dishes
  require this delicate scallionflavored oil. Brushed over noodles,
  barbecued meats, vegetables or breads, it complements each item. 1/4
  cup peanut oil, 2 scallions, finely sliced Heat the oil in a small
  saucepan until hot but not smoking, about 300F. Remove the pan from
  the heat and add the sliced scallions. Let the mixture steep at room
  temperature until completely cooled. This oil mixture will keep
  stored in a tightly covered jar at room temperature for 1 week.
  Yield: 1/4 cup CRISP FRIED SHALLOTS (HANH KHO PHI): This is an
  important ingredient in his many dishes throughout this book. Use as
  specified in recipes. 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup thinly sliced
  shallots Heat the oil in a small saucepan until hot but not smoking,
  about 300F. Add the shallots and fry over moderate heat until crispy
  and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Do not overcook.  Immediately
  remove the shallots with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
  Reserve the oil for another use. Cooked this way, shallots can be
  stored in a tightly covered jar on the kitchen shelf for up to 1
  month.  Yield: about 1/3 cup. ROASTED PEANUTS (DAU PHONG RANG): Use
  shelled and skinned unsalted peanuts for this purpose. Cook a small
  amount at a time and use shortly after they are roasted to preserve
  their flavor. Amounts are specified in recipes using roasted peanuts.
  Place the peanuts in a skillet over moderate heat and cook, stirring
  constantly, until the nuts turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Allow
  to cool. Pound in a mortar with a pestle or process in a spice
  grinder until the peanuts are a bit chunky. Store-bought
  dry-roasted-roasted unsalted peanuts may be substituted in recipes
  calling for roasted peanuts. PEANUT SAUCE (NUOC LEO): This delicious
  sauce originated in the central region and is used as a dip for many
  dishes in this book. Usually, tuong, a fermented soybean sauce, and
  glutinous rice are used to produce this sauce. After several
  experiments, I ended up with this variation where tuong and glutinous
  rice are replaced by hoisin sauce and peanut butter, ingredients that
  are more readily available. 1/4 cup roasted peanuts, ground, 1
  tablespoon peanut oil, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 1 teaspoon chili
  paste (tuong ot tuoi), 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1/2 cup chicken
  broth or water, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, 1/4
  cup hoisin sauce, 1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
  Prepare the roasted peanuts. Set aside. Heat the oil in a small
  saucepan. When the oil is hot, add the garlic, chili paste and tomato
  paste, Fry until the garlic is golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add
  the broth, sugar, peanut butter and hoisin sauce and whisk to
  dissolve the peanut butter. Bring to a boil, Reduce the heat and
  simmer for 3 minutes. Divide the sauce among individual dipping bowls
  and garnish with the ground peanuts and sliced chile. Serve warm or
  at room temperature. Yield: About 1 cup. VEGETABLE PLATTER (DIA RAU
  SONG): Vietnamese meals include an abundance of fresh lettuce, herbs,
  unripe fruits and raw vegetables. These are arranged attractively on
  a platter and are used for wrapping cooked foods at the table,
  usually dipped in Nuoc Cham and eaten out of hand. The following
  herbs, both very important to the Vietnamese, would be authentic
  additions to the Vegetable Platter: One is the "saw leaf herb"
  (Eryngium foetidum, or ngo gai in Vietnamese), a coriander relative.
  The other is polygonum (P. pulchrum or rau ram in Vietnamese), with
  pinkish stems, pointed green leaves and purplish markings. They can
  be found occasionally at Southeast Asian markets. If you have access
  to unripe mango, banana, papaya or apple and star fruit (carambola),
  add them to the platter. You may select or substitute the ingredients
  according to availability and personal taste. 1 large head of Boston
  or other soft lettuce, separated into individual leaves, 1 bunch of
  scallions, cut into 2 inch lengths, 1 cup coriander leaves, 1 cup
  mint leaves, 1 cup fresh Asian or regular basil leaves, 1 cucumber,
  peeled in alternating strips, halved lengthwise and sliced thinly
  crosswise, 4 ounces fresh bean sprouts On a large platter,
  decoratively arrange all of the ingredients in separate groups. Use
  in recipes where required. Yield: 4 to 6 servings

        1 c  Olive oil
        3 c  Flour -- All-purpose
        5 c  Onion -- chopped

  :          Tabasco sauce to taste
        2 c  White wine -- dry
        6 c  Tomato sauce
  
  Make a dark roux with olive oil and flour.  When roux is dark brown,
  add onion, green onion, bell pepper, and celery; cover and cook until
  onions are clear, stirring occasionally. Add tomatoes and continue
  cooning for 10 min; stir often. Add water and stir to make a thick
  liquid. Add garlic, Worcestershire, lemon juice, salt, hot sauce,
  wine, and tomato sauce, making sure to mix well. Add alligator, and
  enough water to cover the ingredients by 2 inches; stir to mix. Bring
  to a boil, stirring frequently. After it comes to a boil, turn heat
  to low and cover, checking from time to time, and stir to prevent
  sauce from sticking. Continue cooking for 3 to 4 hrs. until meat is
  tender. Serve over cooked rice or spaghetti with Parmesan cheese.
  Freeze leftovers in serving size containers.
  
  This recipe is for a party--no one would go to this much trouble if
  the recipe only fed 4 peoples.

 Categories: Meats, Game, Southern
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Lime
      1 g  Water
      1 c  Salt
      1    Red pepper pod
 
  Put 1/2 cup lime in about 1 gallon of boiling water and scald
  quickly, and pull off hair while hot.  Scrape well--remove feet,
  tail, and entrails--like you would a pig.  Cut off ears, remove eyes
  and head if desired.  Pour hot water over it and clean thoroughly.
  
  Put one cup salt in sufficient cold water to cover possum, add 1 pod
  red pepper and let stand overnight.  In the morning remove salt water
  and pour boiling water over it.  Cook in enough boiling water to boil
  up over possum but not enough to cover.  Cook until skin can be
  pierced with a fork easily, and let stand in water until ready for
  baking.
  
  When ready to bake, place possum in pan with skin side up.  Bake in a
  moderate oven until crisp and brown.  If fire is too hot, skin will
  blister and burn.
  
  Carve possum and surround with potatoes (sliced or quartered) which
  have been previously baked.

      Title: ALMOND & HONEY CAKES
 Categories: Cakes, Candies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    250 g  Sweet flan pastry
           Butter; for the tart tin
           Flour; for the tart tin
     20 g  Apricot jelly; for glazing

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    125 g  Sugar
    125 g  Slivered almonds
     90 g  Unsalted butter
     35 g  Honey
      2 tb Double cream
     50 g  Crystallised fruits
           -- chopped
           Kirsch
 
  (Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350
  oF; 200 oC = 400 oF; 230 oC = 450 oF; 250 oC = 475 oF; 2.5 cm = 1
  inch)
  
  Preparation:
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 200 oC. Butter and flour a tart tin with a
  removable base 22 cm in diameter.
  
  Roll out the pastry to fit the tart tin. Line the tin with the pastry
  and prick the bottom all over with a fork. Bake it for 10 minutes at
  the bottom of the pre-heated oven. Leave the pastry shell in the tin.
  
  Cooking:
  
  Lightly brush a thin layer of apricot glaze over the bottom of the
  pastry shell.
  
  Put all the remaining ingredients for the filling into a saucepan and
  heat them gently, stirring to mix them well as they melt.
  
  Raise the oven to 210 oC. When the filling is melted, spread it in a
  thin layer on the glazed pastry shell.
  
  Cook it for about 15 minutes: it is ready when the filling begins to
  bubble.
  
  Leave the cake to cool in its tin, then take it out.
  
  Serving:
  
  Cut the cake into little triangles or rectangular pieces. Serve them
  with coffee, like 'petits fours'.

      Title: ALMOND & RICE FLOUR BREAD WITH POPPY SEEDS
 Categories: Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Whole almonds, with skins
  1 1/2 c  Brown rice flour
      4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      3 ts Poppy seeds
    1/2 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
    1/2 c  Water
      1 lg Whole egg
      1 lg Egg white white
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  This and the following two recipes are wheat free, utilizing brown
  rice flour.  They're from an article by Jacqueline Mallorca in the
  Chron. For those to whom it is important, she's working on a book
  about wheat-free baking.  No hint as to the release date though.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter an 8 x 4inch loaf pan.

      Title: ALMOND BISCOTTI
 Categories: Desserts, Cookies
      Yield: 30 Cookies
 
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter, sweet; melted
      3 tb Brandy
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Almond extract
      1 c  Almonds, unsalted; chopped
      3    Eggs
  2 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 tb Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 350~.  Mix sugar with butter, brandy, vanilla, almond
  extract, nuts and eggs.  Mix well. Stir in flour, baking powder and
  salt. Form into a long loaf (or loaves), place on a cookie sheet and
  bake for 20-30 minutes or until firm and softly cakelike. Remove from
  oven and let cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, slice into
  1/2 inch diagonal slices and return to cookie sheet. Bake for 15-25
  miutes, turning once, until both sides are brown-flecked and toasted.
  Cool thoroughly and store in an airtight jar. Makes 2-3 dozen.
  Variation 1 (Mandlebrot): increase sugar to 1-1/4 cups. Diced dried
  apricots may by added. Variation 2: for a clasic anise-flavored
  biscotto, substitute Pernod, Ouzo or Anisette for the brandy and omit
  the almond extract. Several tablespoons of anise seeds may be added
  for additional oomph. Variation 3 (Hazelnut biscotti): use hazelnuts
  in place of almonds. A hazelnut liqueur may be used instead of
  brandy.  Omit the almond extract. Variation 4 (Mediterranean
  biscotti): use rosewater instead of brandy. Substitute unsalted
  pistachio nuts for the almonds, and add 1/4 - 1/2 cup diced figs to
  the dough. Variation 5 (Ginger-flavored biscotti): to the basic
  dough, add 1 Tbsp powdered ginger, a generous dash of cloves and
  cinnamon, 1 or 2 Tbsp of candied ginger and 1/4 cup raisins, if
  desired.  Omit the almond extract. Variation 6 (Paximatha): this
  Greek rusk dates back to the 5th century, virtually unchanged.
  Substiture 1/2 to 3/4 cup toasted sesame seeds for the almonds. Omit
  the almond extact and flavor the dough with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2
  tsp cloves. Variation 7 (Fekkas):  a Moroccon twice-baked cookie.
  Substitute orange flower water for the brandy. Variation 8; Pine nuts
  may be used instead of almonds, though the richness may be less
  desirable than the crunch of the toasted almonds. Candied fruits,
  too, may be added, 1/4 to 1/2 cup assorted fruits blended into the
  dough before baking. Variation 9 (Chocolate Dipped): melt 1/2 pound
  semi-sweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just
  simmering water. If it "seizes" or "tightens", add 2 Tbsp of unsalted
  buter and it should smooth out again. Dip only one side of each
  cookie (the chocolate won't seal in the moisture that way).

  yeast in the pan first and incorporating the liquid ingredients last,
  pour the milk into the baking pan of your ABM and break in the egg.
  If the butter is not soft, cut it into small chunks to ensure its
  blending into the dough, then add it to the liquids.
  
   Next add the almond paste, slicced so it will blend better too.

  Use two cups of blanched whole almonds. If only unblanched almonds are
  available, blanch them this way: Place the almonds in a saucepan and
  cover with water. Bring to boiling, then drain. The skins should slip
  off easily when you press each almond between your thumb and
  forefinger. Dry on paper towels. Spread the dry almonds in a shallow
  baking pan and toast in a 300 degree oven for about 20 minutes or
  until golden. Cool for 5 minutes before processing or blending.
  
  To process: Place the steel blade in your food processor or blender.
  Add the nuts. Cover and process or blend until a butter forms,
  stopping occasionally to scrape the sides of the bowl or blender a
  few times. Keep processing for three to five minutes or until all of
  the mixture is evenly blended. Process about two minutes more or
  until the butter is the desired smoothness.Store in a covered
  container in your refrigerator for up to two weeks. Bring to room
  temperature for easier spreading. Makes about 1 1/4 cups.

  ingredients and add to dry mixture.  Mix until all ingredients are
  moistened.
  
  Press mixture into a rectangular shape 7 inches wide and nine inches
  long. (Wet hands or use one hand and a damp spoon.)
  
  Bake about 12 minutes.  Remove from oven and cut into 16 bars using a
  sharp knife.  Separate bars slightly and return to oven for 3 to 5
  minutes more. The browner the bottom of the bars, the crisper they

      Title: ALMOND KRUMKAKES
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Sifted powdered sugar
      3 ea Unbeaten egg whites
      2 tb Ground almonds
    1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Cream together butter and powdered sugar; beat well. Add by degrees
  egg whites, almonds, flour and vanilla. This version can also be used
  to make Chinese fortune cookies. COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:
    You will need a krumkake iron, which fits over a 7-inch burner
  surface (gas or electric).  Always use moderate heat.
    For each baking period, the iron should be lightly rubbed at the
  beginning with unsalted butter, but after this initial greasing,
  nothing more is required. The batter needs a preliminary testing, as
  it is quite variable, depending on the condition of the flour, so do
  NOT add at once all the flour called for in the recipe. Test the
  batter for consistency by baking 1 teaspoonful first. The iron is
  geared to use 1 tablespoon of batter for each wafer, and it should
  spread easily over the whole surface but should not run over when
  pressed down. If the batter is too thin, add more flour.  Should any
  batter drip over, lift the iron off its frame and cut off the excess
  batter with a knife run along the edge of the iron.
    Cook each wafer about 2 minutes on each side or until barely
  colored. As soon as you remove it from the iron, roll it on a wooden
  spoon handle or cone form, and, when cool, fill it.

      Title: ALMOND LACE ROLLS
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Unblanched almonds,*
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 tb (rounded) flour
      1 tb Heavy cream
      1 tb Milk
 
  * finely ground
  
   These cookies require precision timing and fast action but the
  results are worth the trouble. I make them for holidays and special
  occasions, but they are delicious anytime.
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø. Butter and flour baking sheet.
  
   In a small, heavy pan, place all ingredients. Cook over low heat,
  stirring constantly until butter melts. Drop by teaspoonful: onto
  baking sheet (do not bake more than six at one time).
  
   Bake at 350ø for 7-9 minutes. Cookies should be only slightly brown
  and still bubbling at the center. Let cool only for a minute or so
  until the edge is firm enough to lift with a thin spatula Then,
  working quickly, lift cookies and turn them top side down onto paper
  towels. Roll over the handle of a wooden spoon to get a cylinder
  shape and let cool until crisp.
  
   Use a fresh cookie sheet for each baking to avoid cookies sticking on
  sheet. If cookies get too firm to roll over the spoon handle, place
  back in the oven for a few moments.
  
   Store cookies in an airtight cookie jar or tin. They will keep for a
  long time, and can be made well ahead of the holiday season.
  
   Variations: These cookies also can be left flat-make them smaller if
  you do that; however, they don't have the flair of the rolled lacy
  effect. Or roll ends of cooled cookies in melted chocolate.

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Light corn syrup
      2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Water
      2    Egg whites
    1/2 ts Almond extract
           Red or green food coloring
    1/4 c  Soft butter or margarine
      1 c  Toasted chopped almonds
    1/4 c  Chopped candied cherries
 
  DIRECTIONS: Mix first 4 ingredients in heavy saucepan. Cook, stirring,
  until sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, until a small
  amount of the mixture dropped in cold water forms a hard ball
  (250-F). Beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry, in large bowl of
  electric mixer. Gradually beat in about one fourth (not more) of the
  syrup, and continue beating until mixture holds its shape. Cook
  remaining syrup until a small amount of mixture separates into hard
  and brittle threads when dropped in cold water (300-F). Gradually
  beat into first mixture, and continue beating until the mixture
  begins to hold its shape. Add flavoring and food coloring to tint a
  delicate shade. Beat in butter; continue beating until very thick and
  satiny. Stir in nuts and cherries. Press into a buttered 8x8x2" pan,
  smoothing top. Let stand until firm. Turn out of pan, and cut in 1
  1/2" by 1" pieces. Wrap each piece individually in waxed paper. For
  best flavor, store several days in a cool place before serving.

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Pecans, chopped (we use
           -chopped almonds on some
           -batches)
    3/4 c  Brown sugar (packed)
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine (butter
           -makes it richer)
    1/2 pk (6 oz size) semisweet
           -chocolate chips. (1/2 cup)
 
  Almond Rocca: This is not for Almond Roca, yet it is close enough and
  it is real easy. In fact my 14 year old daughter has been making it
  by herself at christmas for the past 4 years. Hope this will meet
  your needs. It comes from the Betty Crocker cookbook, so you may have
  it on hand already.
  
  Toffee: Butter square pan, 9x9x2 inches. Spread chopped nuts in pan.
  Heat sugar and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil over
  medium heat, stirring constantly, 7 minutes (watch it real close the
  last minute or two).  Immediately spread mixture evenly over nuts in
  pan. Sprinkle chocolate pieces over hot mixture; place a baking sheet
  over pan so contained heat will melt chocolate. Spread melted
  chocolate over canndy. While hot, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares. chill
  until firm.
  
  Now for the changes we use.
  
  When we are going to be giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2
  cup of chocolate in the microwave.  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than
  the 9x9x2). Spread the melted chocolate on top of the buttered pan
  that is covered with the nuts.  After the chocolate is spread on top,
  sprinkle more nuts on top, while chocolate is still warm. Then cut
  into small sizes. After the candy is set, remove from the pan and
  wrap individually with desert foil. I get mine at the bakery supply,
  or a craft shop.

      3    Hard-boiled egg yolks
      1 l  Chicken stock (2 pints)

           Salt
           White pepper
 
  F.&R.Dahl: "This delicate soup, popular 100 years ago, is now
  unusual. On no account should it be liquidized at any stage, as that
  ruins the texture"
  
  Mince the almonds and, using a pestle and mortar, reduce to a paste
  with the egg yolks and a little stock, to stop them oiling.
  
  Bring the stock up to simmering point in a saucepan and whisk in the
  beurre manie. When that has dissolved, whisk in the almond paste.
  
  Cook gently for 30 minutes.
  
  Strain through a sieve, add the cream, season with salt and pepper,
  heat gently and serve.

  baking soda and set aside.
  
   In a large bowl, cream the butter. Add the coffee, almond extract,
  granulated and brown sugars and beat well. Add the eggs one at a time

  sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and
  beating only until the mixture is smooth. Gently mix in the almonds.
  
   Spread out two pieces of wax paper. place large spoonfuls of the
  dough lengthwise on each piece of paper to form heavy strips about
  10-11 inches long. Fold the long sides of the paper p against the
  dough and, pressing against the paper with your hands, shape each
  strip of dough into a smooth oblong 12 inches long, 3 inches wide,
  and about 1 inch thick. Wrap the dough in the wax paper.

  to the freezer or refrigerator for several hours or overnight. This
  slices best when dough is frozen solid.
  
   Preheat oven to 375ø. Unwrap one roll of dough at a time. Place
  dough on a cutting board. With a very sharp knife cut the dough into
  1/4-inch slices and place them 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on an
  ungreased cookie sheet.
  
   Bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes at 375ø. The cookies are
  done when they are slightly colored and spring back when lightly
  pressed with a fingertip.

 Categories: Chinese, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 oz (1/2 cup) ground almonds
      2 tb (2 1/2 T) ground rice
    1/2 pt (1 1/4 cup) milk
      2 tb (2 1/2 T) sugar
      1 ts Gelatin
 
  Here are a couple of recipes for almond pudding. There are lots of
  variations of this dish some using dairy products, some using gelatin
  and some using agar agar and some combining them. It IS good! This
  first one is more "from scratch".  The second uses almond extract.
  
  Mix the almonds and rice in a bowl with 2 pints (5 cups) cold water,
  cover and leave for 2 hours.  Strain through a fine muslin into a
  large bowl. Add milk and mix well.
  
  Stand the bowl in a large saucepan with enough boiling water to come
  halfway up the sides of the bowl.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Add the sugar, stir well and leave to cool slightly. Mix the gelatin
  with 2 tablespoons (2 1/2 T) hot water until dissolved. Stir into the
  milk mixture when almost cold. Mix well and pour into a shallow
  serving dish. Leave until set.

      Title: ALMONNAISE
 Categories: Vegetarian, Try it
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Almonds, blanched
    1/4 c  Soy milk
      1 ts Nutritional yeast
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 ts Seasoned salt
    1/4 c  Soy milk
  1 1/4 c  Oil, sunflower
      3 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Cider vinegar
 
   Water can be substituted for soy milk.
   Process almonds to fine powder in blender or food processor. Add soy
  milk, yeast, garlic powder, and salt. Blend well, then add remaining
  soy milk to form smooth cream.
   With blender running on low, remove insert in top and drizzle in oil
  in thin stream until mixture is thick. Keep blender running and add
  lemon juice and vinegar. Blend on low for 1 minute longer, to allow
  mixture to thicken to desired consistency.
   Refrigerate tightly sealed; this will keep 10-14 days in
  refrigerator.
   Yields 1-1/2 to 2 cups Note: Do not be discouraged if, on occasion,
  your Almonnaise does not thicken to your expectations. Homemade
  mayonnaise products are among the most sensitive to prepare, and
  sometimes they just don't respond.  This recipe has been made
  successfully by many people, but once in a while it fails even for me
  [the author of The American Vegetarian Cookbook].  For every failure,
  however, I've had hundreds of successes that make it worth the small
  risk.

      2    To 3 mashed very ripe
           Bananas
      3 tb Soy milk
      2 ts White vinegar

      2 ts Wheat gluten
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 pn Salt
 
  Add dry ingredients to the batter, mixing well.  Stir in 1/4 C
  raisins or date pieces (found in the bulk bins at some health food
  stores). Fill cupcake size muffin tins 3/4 full. (Batter is very
  thick.) Bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees, until top is brown and has a
  hard crust. Cool slightly, then remove from tins. Makes 12. This is a
  great recipe to double or triple, depending on how many ripe bananas
  you have.
  
  These freeze beautifully and can be popped in the oven or toaster
  oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes to give them that fresh
  baked feel, if desired.
  
  I use a nonstick muffin pan but I just picked up some cushionaire
  muffin tins and find the breads came out lighter now. I do NOT spray
  the tins with any Pam.

      Title: ALMOST PERFECT CHEESECAKE
 Categories: Desserts, Dairy, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------

MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      1    Box vanilla wafers
      1    Stick butter

MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
 
  Crush  wafers in food processor or blender until finely ground. Melt
  butter and mix with wafers for crust. Press into a 10 inch springform
  pan with your fingers, take care to make the crust as thin as
  possible with special attention to the corners where the crust tends
  to be a bit thick. Filling: Ingredients: 3 large pkg. cream cheese
  3/4 cup sugar juice of one large lemon             3 grade A large
  eggs Directions: Blend thoroughly the cream cheese, sugar and lemon
  juice. Mix until smooth . Add eggs and blend well.  Pour mixture into
  crust and bake for 30 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees. When done the
  cake will be set (not solid), slightly golden, and perhaps split on
  top. It is better slightly over and not under done. Remove from the
  oven and cool on a rack. It will firm up more on cooling. This is an
  important step...cool for about 45 minutes. Topping: Ingredients: 3
  cups sour cream 3/4 cup sugar 2 tsp vanilla Directions: Mix sour
  cream, 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla.  Pour on top of cooled cake. Return
  to 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
  Refrigerate and cool thoroughly (overnight is fine) but at least 5-6
  hours). Freezes well. You may serve now if you do not care for a
  glaze or for a killer bodiller glaze.... Glaze: Ingredients: 1 can (1
  lb) sour pitted cherries (packed in water) 1/2 cup sugar 1 tbs
  cornstarch 1 tbs lemon juice 2 drops red food coloring Directions:
  Drain cherries, reserving 1/2 cup liquid. Put aside cherries. In a
  saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch. Add cherry liquid, stir until
  smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil 1 minute..until
  thick and clear. Remove from heat, let cool slightly. Add lemon
  juice, cherries, food coloring. Cool until still warm but pourable.
  Pour on top on chilled cheese cake. Refrigerate for an hour or
  so.....While the cake may be prepared a day before, do not glaze
  until the day that you plan to serve. I have also used commercially
  prepared pie fillings as a glaze with good results.

      Title: ALMOST-AS-GOOD-AS-BUTTERMILK WAFFLES
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Easy, Quick, Quick & eas
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb Cornmeal, optional
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Cream of tartar
      1 lg Egg, separated
    3/4 c  Milk, scant
      2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
 
  Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
  Whisk yolk with milk and butter. Beat egg white until it just holds a
  2-inch peak. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a thin
  steady stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be careful
  not to add liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward end of
  mixing, use a folding motion to incorporate ingredients; gently fold
  egg white into batter. Spread appropriate amount of batter onto
  waffle iron. Following manufacturer's instructions, cook waffle until
  golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately. (You can keep
  waffles warm on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven for up to 5
  minutes.) Makes 3 to 4 waffles. NOTES : "If you're out of buttermilk,
  try this sweet-milk variation. By making your own baking powder using
  baking soda and cream of tartar and by cutting back on the quantity
  of milk, you can make a thick, quite respectable batter. The result
  is a waffle with a crisp crust and a moist interior." -- Christopher

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Cherries, sour; fresh, ripe,
           ;pitted (about 2 pounds)
      6 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Olive oil
  2 1/2 lb Chicken
      1 ts Salt
      1 md Onion; peeled and cut into
           ;1/8 inch thick slices

      2 c  Rice, iranian; imported or
           ;other uncooked long, soaked
           ;and drained
      8 tb Butter; melted
    1/4 ts Saffron threads; pulverized
           ;with a mortar and pestle or
           ;the back of a spoon, and
           ;dissolved in 1 tablespoon
           ;warm water

MMMMM----------------SILVER XPRESS MAIL SYSTEM 5---------------------
 
    Combine the cherries and sugar in a 2 to 3 quart saucepan, and,
  stirring gently, bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to
  low and simmer uncovered for 2 or 3 minutes, or until the cherries
  have softened somewhat and given off most of their liquid. Remove
  from the heat.
    In a heavy 3 to 4 quart casserole, heat the olive oil over moderate
  heat until a light haze forms above it. Pat the chicken completely
  dry with paper towels and sprinkle it inside and out with salt. Brown
  the chicken in the hot oil, turning it frequently with a large spoon
  or tongs and regulating the heat so that the bird colors quickly and
  deeply without burning.
    Place the chicken on a plate and add the onion slices to the oil
  remaining in the casserole. Stirring frequently, cook for about 10
  minutes, or until the slices are richly browned. Return the chicken
  and all of the juices which have accumulated on the plate to the
  casserole, add the « cup of water and bring to a boil over high heat.
  Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and simmer for about 30
  minutes, or until the chicken is tender.
    Transfer the chicken to a plate, set aside 2 tablespoons of the
  cooking liquid and discard the onion slices. When the bird is cool
  enough to handle, cut it into 6 or 8 serving pieces.
    Meanwhile, bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a heavy 4 to 5 quart
  casserole with a tightly fitting lid. Pour in the rice in a slow, thin
  stream so the water does not stop boiling. Stir once or twice, boil
  briskly for 5 minutes, then drain the rice in a sieve.
    Pour the reserved chicken cooking liquid and 4 tablespoons of the
  melted butter into the casserole and stir them together. Add half of
  the rice and, with a spatula or spoon, smooth it to the edges of the
  casserole. Cook uncovered over moderate heat for 5 minutes, then
  remove the casserole from the heat and add the chicken and half of
  the reserved cherries. Spread the remaining rice on top and pour in
  all the remaining cherries and their cooking liquid.  Cover tightly
  and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rice is
  tender.
    To serve, spoon about a cup of the rice into a small bowl, add the
  remaining 4 tablespoons of melted butter and the dissolved saffron
  and stir until the mixture is bright yellow. Place a layer of rice on
  a heated platter.  Arrange the chicken on top of it, cover the
  chicken with the remaining rice and cherry mixture. Sprinkle the
  saffron rice on top. With a metal spatula, lift the rice crust from
  the bottom of the casserole and arrange small pieces of it around the
  edge of the platter.

  Comment: I wanted to share a recipe which I have been making this
  winter for my family.  It is a good cold weather dish. It makes
  enough for a crowd ~ my family (2 adults and 3 teens) only eat about
  half. This can be made ahead and chilled until ready to use.
