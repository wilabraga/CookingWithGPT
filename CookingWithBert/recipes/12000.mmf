      Title: CHEDDAR-ALE PUB SPREAD
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8 oz Old Cheddar Cheese, GRATED
      8 oz Cream Cheese, SOFTENED
    125 ml Ale or beer
      1 ts Dry mustard
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 c  Finely chopped toasted
           -pecans
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley (fresh)
 
  Place cheeses in food processor or blender, process until smooth. (I
  used a combination of by hand and an electric mixer) Gradually add
  ale, mustard and cayenne pepper. If mixture is soft, refrigerate
  until firm enough to hold shape.  Mould into a disc shape ( a sphere
  or ball!!). Combine pecans and parsley.  Pat the mixture onto the
  ball or roll the ball in the mixture until the cheese mixture is
  covered completely. Place on a serving plate or board and surround
  with crackers or flatbreads. Slices of apple are nice with this too.
  
  This is an easy thing to make and is very tasty.

      Title: CHEESE & CHILE SQUARES
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      2 oz Parmesan cheese, cut in
           -several pieces
      2    (4-ounce) cans mild or hot
           -green chiles
      4 oz Longhorn cheddar cheese,
           -chilled
     12 oz Monterey Jack cheese,
           -chilled
      1 ts Salt
           Several dashes Tabasco sauce
     10    Eggs, divided
    1/3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Melted butter
      2 c  Cottage cheese
 
  Using the metal blade, drop the Parmesan cheese pieces through the
  feed tube with the motor running and process until finely grated.
  Remove and set aside. Without washing the workbowl, use the metal
  blade to chop the chiles. Remove and set aside.
  
  Use the shredding disc to process the Cheddar and Monterey Jack
  cheeses separately. Remove and set aside.
  
  Using the metal blade, process to combine the salt, tabasco sauce, 2
  eggs, flour, baking powder and grated Parmesan cheese. With the
  machine running, add the hot melted butter through the feed tube.
  Remove the cover and add the cottage cheese and then process until
  smooth. With the machine running, add 3 eggs through the feed tube.
  Remove 2/3 of the mixture from the workbowl and combine with the
  Cheddar cheese and chiles. Add the remaining eggs and Monterey Jack
  cheese to the remaining mixture in the workbowl and process 20- 30
  seconds.
  
  Combine the 2 mixtures and spread in a buttered 17x10 inch jelly roll
  pan.
  
  Bake 15 minutes in a preheated 400^ oven, then reduce temperature to
  350^ and bake about 34-40 minutes more until the cheese is set and
  firm. Cut into squares and serve warm with your favorite salsa. Makes
  24 thin slices.
  
  Note: If you have a large capacity machine, all the eggs may be added
  at once and both cheeses may be added and combined in the processor
  bowl.
  
  This typical appetizer is usually baked in a rectangular pan and cut
  in squares. The presentation is further enhanced if accompanied by a
  tomato salsa of your choice. It should be served warm, but can be
  baked ahead and reheated.
  
  I have a cookbook that brings together several of my all time
  favorites: Anne Lindsay Greer--one of my favorite chefs, is the
  author Food processor adapted--a real joy in food preparation SW

  It's called Cuisine of the American Southwest, by Anne Lindsay Greer.

  rectangle. Roll out another 1/4 of the package into a rectangle,
  again being sure to seam pieces together, and place on top of cheese

  escape and bake for about 20 minutes. CUt in squares to serve, this
  is good warm or at room temperature. Repeat process with remaining
  crescent rolls and filling to make an additional borka.

      Title: CHEESE & POBLANO QUESADILLAS
 Categories: Mesamexican, Mexican, Main dish, Lnet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Grated manchego cheese
      1 c  Grated panela cheese
    1/2 c  Grated cotija cheese
      6 ea Flour tortillas
    1/2 c  Chipotle salsa (optional)
      4 ea Poblano chiles, roasted,
           -peeled, seeded & julienned
      2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
 
  In a bowl, mix together the cheeses.
  
  Lay the tortillas on a counter. Divide the cheese mix into 6 portions
  and spread over half of each tortilla. If desired, sprinkle about a
  tablespoon of salsa over each. Arrange the chile strips evenly over
  the cheese. Fold the tortillas over to enclose the filling and brush
  the tops with butter.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350øF.
  
  Place a dry griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place
  the tortillas buttered side down in the pan. Cook until very light
  golden,a bout 1 minute. Then brush the uncoated sides with butter and
  flip over. Cook until golden, and transfer to a baking sheet. When
  all the quesa- dillas are cooked, transfer the baking sheet to the
  oven and bake 10 min- utes, until the cheese begins to ooze.
  
  Serve hot, whole or cut into wedges.
  
  NOTE: Manchego Cheese: There are two kinds of manchego used in mexican
  cooking - and neither is the high-priced Spanish variety sold in
  upscale cheese shops. There is a hard variety (called viejo) and a
  soft, semifirm, golden one that is an excellent melter. The soft one
  is used most often for cooking. Monterey Jack or muenster can be
  substituted.
  
  Anejo Cheese: Also known as Cotija, is a salty, crumbly white cheese,
  similar to feta in appearance. Romano or washed and dried feta are
  good substitutes.
  
  Panela Cheese: is a mild, milky-tasting, fresh white cheese often
  sold in rounds. A ricotta, farmer's or dry cottage cheese can be
  substituted.
  
  The reason Mary Sue and Susan like to use one part manchego, one part
  panella and one-half part anejo is because they give a greater
  texture and flavor than just one cheese, but is not a hard-and-fast
  rule. They both say to go right ahead and use whatever you happen to
  have in the kitchen, or experiment and come up with you own cheese
  mix.

  In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.  Stir in flour and cook
  the roux, stirring, for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add the milk,
  scalded, in a stream, whisking vigorously, until the mixture is thick
  and smooth. Simmer the sauce for 3-4 minutes, and whisk in the tomato
  paste, Swiss and Parmesan cheeses, cayenne, and salt to taste. Whisk
  until the cheeses have melted.
  
  Remove from heat and whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time, beating
  well after each addition. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, and let it
  cool.
  
  In a bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with a pinch
  of salt until they hold soft peaks.  Add the Sherry and beat to stiff
  peaks. Fold the egg white mixture into the cheese mixture gently but
  thoroughly.
  
  Transfer the mixture to 6 buttered 2/3-cup ramekins, and bake the
  souffles on a jelly roll pan in the middle of a preheated 400foven
  for 25-30 minutes, or until they are cooked through.
  
  Serve immediately.

       Preheat oven to 375 F. In a 1 quart saucepan on a low flame,
       bring water, margarine, salt, and cayenne to a boil. When
       margarine melts, lower heat. Add flour. Dough will form a ball.
       Stir ball with a wooden spoon continually for 2 to 3 minutes.
       Scrape bottom of pan often to keep dough from sticking. Remove
       from heat and place dough in a large mixing bowl. Spread dough in
       the bowl and let cool for 10 minutes.
       Since your hands will soon become very sticky, place a large
       baking sheet near bowl before beginning next step.
       When dough is cool enough so that eggs do not cook in dough, add
       all of eggs to dough. Mash by hand until eggs are completely
       mixed. Add cheese and mix thoroughly.
       Place ball of dough in center of ungreased baking sheet. Spread
       dough from center to form a 5 x 8 inch oval ring.

  2 1/2 ts Yeast

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/3 c  Feta Cheese; grated
    1/3 c  Parmesan or Romano Cheese

MMMMM----------------------------MISC---------------------------------
      1 oz Vegetable oil; approx
 
  Grate all cheeses. (You may use parmesan or romano cheese or a
  mixture of both. Amounts are approximate.) Place some of the
  parmesan/romano cheese in a small bowl. Mix the remaining cheeses
  together. Make the dough using the "dough" cycle of the Breadmaker.
  When done; take the dough out of the pan and squeeze out gasses. Make
  12 balls of dough and place temporarily in a baking pan that is lined
  with vegetable oil. One at a time, take each ball and spread or roll
  (rolling pin is fine) into a six or seven inch circle. Place a
  generous strip of the cheese mixture along one side and roll up like
  a log. Gently make a coil out of each log. If necessary, seal the end
  with a little water. Dip the top in some additional parmesan on an
  ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat until all of the balls look like cute
  little buns, then bake at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes or until lightly
  browned. This recipe was adapted for the breadmaker from Mom's recipe
  for Spinach Bulemas. I leave out the spinach because my husband,
  Shelly, HATES spinach! As a part of our Sephardic (Jewish) family
  tradition, Bulemas and hard boiled eggs are served before the main
  meal on holidays and after returning from synagogue on Saturdays.

      Title: CHEESE CRACKERS
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese
    1/2 c  Flour, part for rolling
      2 tb Margarine or butter
    1/4 ts Salt
        pn Paprika
        pn Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Water
 
  Mix all together in a bowl.  Original directions suggested shaping
  into a roll 1 1/2 inch wide, chilling at least 2 hours wrapped in wax
  paper and cutting in thin slices to make 1 dozen or more crackers.
  This would produce neatly shaped crackers, possibly thicker than
  desired.
  
  By rolling very thin, this amount of dough will make small crackers
  about 1/2 inch apart to cover 1 1/2 small cookie sheets. They do puff
  up while baking. May be cut quickly in random small shapes with a
  plastic knife.
  
  Suggested toppings coarse salt (made them too salty), garlic salt,
  celery salt, curry powder, or freshly ground black pepper. If the
  dough is very dry after rolling, brush tops with water before
  salting. If it is soft, sprinkle lightly and press the salt into the
  crackers.
  
  Bake 5 minutes at 425 F or until browned.

 Categories: Cheese, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Qt
 
 
        3 c  mild cheddar cheese,
  :          shredded (you can also
  :          use sharp if you want)
        1 c  shredded swiss cheese
  :     1/2 c  beer (any kind will do)
  :       1 ts minced garlic
  :       1 ts dried mustard
  :       1 ts Worchestershire sauce
  :          salt and pepper to taste
  
  In a covered plastic bowl, mix cheeses and toss with a small handful
  of flour to coat (this helps the cheese to melt nicely without
  clumps). In a fondue pot (or sauce pan if you don't have one), bring
  the beer to steaming, but not boiling.
  
  Slowly mix in cheese, stirring constantly.  If you have too much
  cheese, and the sauce becomes too thick, you may need to add a little
  more beer to thin it to your taste. Add garlic, worc. sauce, mustard,
  and salt and pepper.  Mix very well.
  
  Turn your fondue pot or saucepan to low and dip away!
  
  Use this delicious cheese sauce to dip:
    Bread Chunks(rye, french, italian, pumpernickel, or any other kind)
    Apple pieces (MacIntosh and Granny Smith work really well)
    Carrot slices
    Cauliflower florets
    Any other raw vegetable you can think of!
  
  Be careful!  As you near the bottom of the pot, the cheese is VERY
  hot. Walt MM

      1 lb Cheddar cheese sharp, grated
      5 x  Cloves fresh garlic

      2 tb Kirsch or cherry brandy
           ****DIPPERS****
           FRENCH BREAD
           Ham
           Shrimp
           Smokie links
           Cocktail wieners
           ****DIPPERS****
           Hot dogs
           Smoked sausage
           Turkey, chicken breast
           Turkey ham
           Broccoli
           Cauliflower
           Carrots
           Mushrooms
           Brussel sprouts
           Cherry tomatoes
           Celery stalk
           Radishes
 
  Heat cheese soup in fondue pot or heavy skillet on low. Slowly add
  grated cheddar cheese, Kirsch, and garlic (for best results use
  freshly pressed) If mixture looks too thin, add 2 or 3 tb flour to a
  small amt. of cold milk, stir until smooth, and slowly add to pot
  while stirring. FRENCH BREAD: get the baguettes if available in your
  area, if not, any type will have to do. Be sure to heat it in oven at
  350 degrees for about 10 minutes, then cut it into bite sized pieces.
  It's best when crusty. MEAT DIPPERS: (heat and cut into bite sized
  pieces any or all of these). Ham, shrimp, smokie links, cocktail
  wieners, smoked sausage, turkey breast, chicken breast, turkey ham,
  hot dogs. VEGETABLE DIPPERS : (slightly cooked ...do not overcook, or
  else the pieces will slip off the fondue fork and get "lost" in the
  pot.... or raw), cut into bite sized pieces Broccoli, cauliflower,
  carrots, mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, cherry tomatoes, celery stalk,
  radishes. VARIATION: Instead of cheddar cheese soup use Campbell's
  Nacho cheese dip (soup) in cans, and substitute part or all of it for
  regular cheddar cheese soup, or add some finely chopped jalape¤o
  peppers to the cheese mixture for extra zest. SPECIAL HINTS: Serve to
  company (it's always a hit!) on a cold fall day for lunch, or a
  freezing winter's night, or warm their hearts during a gentle spring
  rain. Best if served accompanied by champagne or wine. Best mood is
  created if candles are lit and a fire is blazing in the fireplace.
  Sit fondue pot with fondue in the middle of the table, pot on low
  heat. Place dippers in individual bowls. Each guest gets a fondue
  fork and first spears a dipper with it, then dips it into the cheese
  sauce, twirl it around slowly and balance into mouth. Very addictive,
  so be careful. (Renate's own recipe developed and perfected over many
  years). Enjoy!

                         DEFINITIONS
                           Cheeses The most essential ingredient in any
  cheesecake is -- you guessed it -- Cheese. The cheeses that are most
  commonly used are cream cheese, Neufchatel, cottage cheese, and
  riccota, but there are some recipes that use such cheeses as gouda
  and Swiss.
   Cheese is made from milk, whether it be from cows, goats, or sheep.
   It has even been made from buffalo and reindeer milk. The milk is
  separated into curds (solids) and whey (liquids) and most of the
  cheeses are made from the curds, although riccota is made from the
  whey. The fresh or uncured cheeses are the ones you mostly will be
  using in your cheesecakes, and these include cream cheese, neufchatel
  and cottage cheese. Although these unripened cheeses all have roughly
  the same proportion of cheese solids (roughly 15 to 18 percent), they
  differ greatly in their butterfat content.  All other things being
  equal, the higher the butterfat content, the creamier the cheesecake.
   CREAM CHEESE: Cream cheese, made from milk, must contain at least 33
  percent butterfat and has one hundred calories per ounce. The water
  content is 50 percent, the texture is smooth and oft, the flavor
  delicate.
   Allow the cheese to come to room temperature before using it so that
  it will blend easily with other ingredients.
   Cream cheese is sold in three-ounce and eight-ounce packages in all
  supermarkets.  Packages are usually dated so be sure to check for
  freshness when you purchase it. Once purchased, the cheese is usable
  for at least three weeks, sometimes even longer.  The most widely
  distributed brand is Kraft's Philadelphia Brand Cream Cheese although
  store brands are also available. We've found that these store brands
  vary somewhat in quality; they aren't always as smooth and rich as
  we'd like. You may want to do some experimenting to see how well
  store brands available in your area compare in flavor and texture
  with the national brand. Imitation cream cheese is available in some
  places, but we don't recommend it for your cheesecakes.
   NEUFCHATEL: Neufchatel is made, in the United States, very similar to
  cream cheese.  It is made from whole or skim milk, or a combination
  of milk and cream.  Its butterfat content is a little lower -- about
  25 percent -- and it usually has 70 calories per ounce. The water
  content is 60 percent; the texture is a little lighter than cream
  cheese. The flavor is milder, but in most cases it can be substituted
  for cream cheese when a lower fat content is desired.
   But then again, who do you think you're kidding?  No matter how you
  slice it, cheesecake is fattening.  If you do decide to adapt a
  cream-cheese recipe for use with neufchatel, remember that the water
  content is a little higher than cream cheese; you may want to
  increase slightly the quantity of one of the moisture-holding
  ingredients (such as flour, cornstarch, gelatin, or egg whites)
  called for in the recipe.
   Neufchatel is sold much as is cream cheese and the usable life is
  about the same.  Do not confuse this with the French neufchatel,
  which is similar to a camembert.
   COTTAGE CHEESE: A wide variety of cottage cheeses are available on
  the market ranging in butterfat content from 1/2 percent to 4
  percent. The dry curd cottage cheeses have roughly twenty calories
  per ounce and those with 4 percent butterfat contain about thirty
  calories per ounce. The curds themselves are made from skim milk. The
  richer cottage cheeses, sometimes called creamed cottage cheese are
  made by adding the whole milk and cream to the curds.  Unless
  otherwise noted, the recipes calling for the use of Cottage cheese
  mean the creamed cottage cheese (at least 2 percent butterfat)
  carefully drained of excess moisture.
   FARMER CHEESE: This is skim-milk cottage cheese that has been
  pressed into small squares or rectangles.  It is usually sold in
  delicatessens or specialty shops as bricks. Dry-curd cottage cheese
  can be substituted for farmer cheese if necessary.
   RICOTTA: In the United States, ricotta is almost always made from
  whole milk or a combination of milk and whey. The fat content is from
  4 to 10 percent and there are about 50 calories per ounce. The water
  content is about 72 percent; the texture is slightly grainy, ranging
  to creamier if made from all milk.  It is sold in 15 or 32-oz
  containers which are usually dated.  Be sure to check for freshness,
  since this cheese keeps only for a few days.
   Skim-milk ricotta is also available, and this resembles the original
  ricotta made in Italy.  Most cheesecake recipes call for the whole
  milk ricotta.

                        CREAM Many of the recipes call for cream, either
  sweet or sour. Usually the cream is added to lighten the cake or
  provide a richer flavor. SWEET CREAM: Cream comes in several
  different grades, depending upon the fat content. Heavy cream
  contains about 40 percent butterfat, 5 percent milk solids, and over
  50 percent water. it has about 53 calories per Tablespoon. Light
  cream contains about 20 percent butterfat and 7 percent milk solids;
  the rest is water. It has about 32 calories per Tablespoon.  Half and
  half, a blending of heavy cream and milk has about 12 percent
  butterfat, 7 percent milk solids and 51 percent water. It has about
  20 calories per Tablespoon. Heavy cream is added to the ingredients
  of a cheesecake most often as whipped cream.  When whipped, heavy
  cream will double in volume; for best results, use a chilled bowl and
  chilled beaters. Often confectioners sugar is added as the cream
  begins to stiffen to help retain the volume.  Heavy cream is
  perishable, so buy only as much as you plan to use within the next
  few days. A new ultrapasteurized type of cream is now widely
  available which has a much longer life. Many people find that it does
  not whip up as high and that it lacks much of the flavor of the more
  traditional kind.  We leave the choice to you. Light cream is used
  less often in baking but is available in most supermarkets. It is
  also very perishable and should be purchased in small quantities. In
  most cheesecake recipes where light cream is indicated, half and half
  may be substituted. Half and half is also available in most
  supermarkets, but you can mix up your own from equal quantities of
  whole milk and heavy cream. SOUR CREAM: This is cream that has been
  processed commercially so as to be soured under ideal conditions.  It
  contains about 20 percent butterfat, about 7 percent milk solids and
  the remainder is water. There are about 30 calories per Tablespoon.
  Sour cream is sold in containers varying from one half pound to one
  pound. It is usually dated, so check for freshness when you purchase
  the container.  Sour cream will last up to two weeks in the
  refrigerator. Most brands seem to be uniformly good. SUGAR AND OTHER
  SWEETENERS Every desert cheesecake requires a sweetening of some
  kind. Most of the recipes use granulated sugar. However, it is
  possible to substitute brown sugar or honey in almost all of the
  recipes. HONEY: Remember that honey will make your cheesecakes
  darker, which you may find undesirable. And, since it is less soluble
  than granulated sugar, it is necessary to be especially careful that
  it is blended into the cheese mixture. Honey is used as the sweeter
  in such cheese cakes as Yogurt No-Bake Cheesecake and No Bake Honey
  Cheese Pie, but if you want to use it in other cakes, you must adjust
  the quantities. Since honey is sweeter and has a higher moisture
  content than granulated sugar, use one-third less honey by volume
  and, when possible, reduce the volume of other liquids by one-fourth
  cup for each cup of honey used.  This can be done by appropriately
  varying the proportions of dry (cream cheese) and moist (sour cream)
  dairy products. BROWN SUGAR: This is fine crystals of sugar coated
  with molasses, sold in either a dark or light form.  Brown sugar is
  used as an ingredient in the Praline Cheesecake, but could be
  substituted for granulated sugar in other cakes as well. As with the
  honey, brown sugar will make your cake darker, and you must blend it
  in well. Measurements will remain the same. We don't recommend using
  the granulated brown sugar or the liquid form of brown sugar.
  CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR: Also commonly available, this sugar has been
  crushed to a fine powder similarly in texture to cornstarch. It is
  used in cheesecakes primarily in beating egg whites as a means of
  stiffening them. Often it is also added to whipped cream as a
  sweetening. FLOUR AND OTHER THICKENING AGENTS Although eggs are
  generally best for holding together the ingredients of a successful
  cheesecake, there are several other ingredients that can be used in
  addition or in place of them. Flour and cornstarch also thicken the
  batter and stabilize the moisture content. FLOUR: In most recipes, we
  indicate either all purpose flour or self rising flour. The
  all-purpose flour can be either bleached or unbleached and today
  usually comes pre-sifted. If not, sift before measuring. Self-rising
  flour is bleached flour to which has been added a leavening agent
  such as baking powder. Whichever you use, remember to use it
  judiciously. Too much flour will make the cheesecake tough.
  CORNSTARCH: Finer than flour, cornstarch is more effective as a
  thickening agent. As with the flour, too much cornstarch will leave
  your cheesecake tough. GELATIN: Unflavored gelatin is commonly
  available in one-ounce envelopes. It is a thickening agent that works
  best when refrigerated, thus this is the basic ingredient in most of
  the no-bake cheesecakes.  It must be blended well with the
  ingredients and completely dissolved. Too much gelatin will make a
  rubbery cheesecake.

                     MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS Milk is used infrequently in
  cheesecakes.  Other milk products that appear more frequently in
  cheesecakes are buttermilk, sweetened condensed milk, and Yogurt.
  Buttermilk is made when special bacteria are added to lowfat milk;
  therefore, an average eight-ounce serving has about 100 calories. It
  is available in most supermarkets, in 1-quart containers.
   Sweetened condensed milk is evaporated milk to which sugar has been
  added. It is very high in calories -- about 980 calories in a cup.
   It is sold, unrefrigerated, in most supermarkets. Yogurt is milk
  that has been allowed to ferment to a semisolid consistency. It can
  be made from either whole or skim milk. It is often used as a
  substitute for sour cream, since it often achieves a similar result.
   If you do attempt to substitute yogurt for sour cream, use whole milk
  yogurt if possible and drain carefully of excess water. Yogurt has far
  fewer calories as well -- about 120 as opposed to sour cream's
  average of 475 per cup.  Yogurt is sold in all supermarkets in
  eight-ounce and larger containers. You can also make it at home quite
  easily.
                             EGGS Since the cheeses and creams used in
  cheesecakes have such a high moisture content, it is necessary to
  have an ingredient that can hold or absorb water.  The most popular
  and the most elegant solution to this problem is the egg. Also since
  egg yolks and whites harden as they bake, they add body and texture
  to the cheesecake. Egg yolks in particular contain lecithin, an
  emulsifier, which has the effect of congealing the fats in the
  cheese. Generally a cheesecake recipe with a high fat content will
  also call for relatively more eggs.
   EGG WHITES; Many recipes require you to separate the eggs and to
  beat the whites until they form stiff peaks with the beaters of your
  mixer. As egg whites are beaten, the albumen is spun out into a finer
  and finer web of protein, the finer the structure, the more moisture
  the batter can hold. If the whites are overbeaten or overheated,
  however, the delicate structure collapses and the result is a soggy
  cheesecake.
   Since air is also encapsulated, the egg whites also add lightness to
  the cake.  Oddly enough, the freshest eggs are not the best for
  cheesecakes; the whites of eggs that are a few days old can be beaten
  to a larger volume. Unless you have access to farm fresh eggs,
  though, this isn't likely to be a problem as most of the store bought
  eggs are already at least several days old.
   When beating the egg whites, add a dash of cream of tartar to make
  them more stable.  To make the whites stiffer 9 if this is desired)
  you can blend in some confectioners' sugar or a boiling sugar syrup
  once the whites have reached the soft peak stage.
                     BUTTER AND SHORTENING Except for a few special
  cheesecakes, butter is not found among the ingredients in the
  fillings. However, it is basic for most of the crusts. Please use
  sweet butter rather than the salted.
                        FRUITS AND NUTS Many of the cheesecake recipes
  use the grated rind of a lemon or orange. For the best results use
  the fresh peel rather than the dried because as the peels are dried
  they lose much of their aromatic oils.  The only part of the peel
  that is used is the outermost, colored layer, called the zest. The
  zest can be removed with a zester or with any ordinary grater.
   Many cheesecake recipes call for a small amount of lemon juice.
   Fresh is the best to use, but good results can be obtained using
  reconstituted lemon juice.  You may wish to experiment, varying the
  amount to suit your own taste and which kind to use.
   Many times ground nuts are called for and it has been found that
  lightly toasting them brings out a better flavor in almonds and
  hazelnuts (filberts).  They retain more of their crunch when used in
  the batter. To roast the nuts, spread them out on a baking pan and
  bake for 10 minutes or so in a 350 degree F. oven, stirring
  occasionally to ensure even browning. If you use hazel nuts
  (filberts) that still have their paperlike skins, the skins must be
  removed before use -- they acquire a burnt taste during the roasting.
   The cost of nuts, especially walnuts, in small quantities is
  outrageous, but you can save a bundle if you buy them in the bulk and
  in the shell. Shelled nuts turn rancid fairly quickly, though, store
  them in the refrigerator or freezer, well wrapped.
                      SPICES AND FLAVORINGS Spices such as cinnamon,
  cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and cardamom will appear frequently in
  cheesecake recipes because the contrast so well with the mildness of
  the cheeses. Spices do deteriorate as they sit on your rack, so be
  sure to always have fresh ones on hand for your baking day. Cinnamon
  and ginger can be used ground commercially, but you may want to grate
  your own nutmeg and grind your own cloves or cardamom from the whole
  spices. A coffee grinder is one of the best ways to do this.
   Certain flavorings such as vanilla extract or instant-coffee powder
  are used in cheesecakes. Rosewater is used in some and can be found in
  specialty stores as well as the drugstore.
   Chocolate is used in the mocha-flavored and chocolate-flavored
  cheesecakes.  Please use the real chocolate, baking or semi-sweet

      1    Egg white mixed with 1
           -tablespoon water.
 
  INSTRUCTIONS:PASTRY CRUST-/
  
  In a large mixing bowl,make a well in the center of two cups of
  flour.Drop into it the butter {or
     lard} ,egg yolks,sugar, Marsala, lemon peel and salt.With your
  fingertips mix the ingredients together,incorporating as much flour
  as you can.With the heels of your hands,work in the rest of the flour
  until the dough is smooth and can be gathered into a ball.Do not,
  however,knead the dough or work it any more than necessary.{If you
  have an electric mixer with a paddle attachment,all of the
  ingredients can be placed in the bowl at once and mixed at low speed
  until they are just combined.}The dough can be rolled out at once,
  but if it seems at all oily,refrigerate it for about 1 hour,or until
  it is firm but not hard.
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 350^.Break off about 1/4 of the dough,dust
  lightly with flour and cover with wax paper or plastic wrap ;set
  aside in the refrigerator.Reshape the rest of the dough into a ball
  and place on a lightly floured board or pastry cloth.With the heel of
  your hand,flatten the ball into a disc about 1 inch thick.Dust a
  little flour over both sides of the disc to prevent the dough from
  sticking,and begin rolling it out---starting from the center and
  rolling to within an inch of the far edge.Gently lift the dough,turn
  clockwise,and roll out again from the center to the far edge.Repeat
  lifting,turning and rolling until the disc is about 1/8 inch thick
  and at least 11 inches across.If the dough sticks to the board or
  cloth while you are rolling it out,lift it gently with a wide metal
  spatula and sprinkle a little flour under it.
  
  Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 9-by-11/2-inch spring-form or
  false-bottom cake pan.Then,starting at the nearest edge of the
  circle,lift the pastry and drape it over the rolling pin. Place the
  pin in the middle of the buttered pan,and unfold the pastry over
  it,leaving some slack in the center.Gently press the pastry into the
  bottom and around the sides of the pan,taking care not to stretch
  it.Roll the pin over the edge of the pan,pressing down hard to trim
  off the excess pastry around the top.
  
  Unwrap the remaining pastry,place it on a lightly floured board or
  cloth,flattenit with the heel of your hand and roll it into a
  rectangle about 12 inches long.With a pastry wheel or sharp knife,cut
  the rectangle into long,even strips about 12 inch wide.
  INSTRUCTIONS:RICOTTA FILLING -
  
  Combine the ricotta cheese with 1 2 cup of sugar,1 tablespoon flour,1
  2 teaspoon salt,the vanilla,grated orange peel and egg yolks,and beat
  until they are thoroughly mixed.Stir in the raisins and the candied
  orange peel and citron.Spoon this filling into the partially baked
  pastry shell,spreading it evenly with a rubber spatula.Sprinkle the
  top with slivered almonds or pine nuts,then weave or crisscross the
  pastry strips across the pie to make a lattice design.Brush the
  strips lightly with the egg-white -an d-water mixture.Bake on the
  middle shelf of the oven for 1 to 1&1/4 ho urs,or until the crust is
  golden and the filling is firm.
  
  Remove the pie from the oven and slide off the outside the outside
  rim of the pan.Cool the pie on a wire rack,leaving the bottom disc in
  place.If you would prefer to remove the disc before serving the
  pie,wait until the pie is cool,loosen the bottom crust with a wide
  metal spatula, and carefully slide the pie off the disc onto a round
  serving plate.
  
  Fresh fruits like white grapes,served with crostata di ricotta,make a
  tangy, sweet contrast to the richness of the pie. Crostata di ricotta
  is one of the oldest Roman dishes.

    3/4 c  Flour -- unsifted
    3/4 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Dry mustard
    1/8 ts Paprika
  1 1/4 qt Hot milk
  2 1/2 lb Processed cheddar cheese --
           Shredded
 
  Line four 8x8-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap. Allow
  enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six servings
  or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be served
  without freezing.
  
  Melt butter in a large sauce pan.  Stir in flour and seasonings. Add
  hot milk slowly.  Cook until thickened, stirring constantly. Add
  cheese; stir until cheese is melted.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Serve over hot toast.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Pour each part to be frozen into a baking pan. Cool for 30
  minutes at room temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up
  over top of food. Put edges of wrap together and fold several times
  so paper lies directly on top of food.  Fold ends of freezer wrap
  over the top and seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food,
  date of freezing, and last date the food should be used for best
  eating quality (about 6 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12
  hours before removing packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN SAUCE:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
  freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Heat 45 minutes or until
  bubbly at edges. Stir occasionally during heating. After heating,
  stir until rarebit is smooth.  If rarebit is too thick, thin with hot
  milk. Serve over hot toast.

 Categories: Bread

      1 ts Garlic salt or powder
      1 ts Italian seasonings
     44 oz Cold water
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
      1 tb Parsley flakes
      5 lb Bisquick
      1 lb Cheddar cheese,grated
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
  large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
  After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
  with garlic powder, parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts
  will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
  Serve hot.
  
  The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
  have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you
  desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2
  cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12
  biscuits.
  
  You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if
  desired. From: Hp_walls@woco.Ohio.Gov

      1 oz Butter -- OR margarine
 
  My Notes: When the Red Lobster restaurant that we go to started
  serving their cheese rolls, I managed to talk the manager out of this
  recipe. It's been posted numerous times since 3/90 by me and by
  Elaine Radis and others. The quantities I've given are as the manager
  gave me. Later, I cut the ingredient quantities down to be more
  useable by the average family. These do freeze, however, so it's
  worthwhile making the larger batch and freezing the ones you do not
  plan to use immediately.
  
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
  large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
  After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
  with garlic powder, parsley flakes and Italian seasoning. (Amounts
  will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
  Serve hot. The RL manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
  have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you desire.

  This qualifies as a savory; a bit of a change from the usual scone.
  
  Preheat oven to 425F (220C).  Lightly grease a large baking sheet; set
  aside.  Sift all-purpose flour, baking powder, dry mustard and salt
  into a large bowl. Stir in the whole-wheat flour. With your fingers,
  rub in cold butter until mixture is crumbly.  Stir in 1/2 cup cheese.
  Make a well in center of mixture; add milk and mix with a fork to
  make a dough that BARELY holds together (you may need to press dough
  together with your hands). Turn out onto floured surface and knead
  lightly. Roll out with a floured rolling pin or pat dough with your
  hands to make a round about 3/4-inch thick. Cut into rounds with a
  2-inch fluted or plain cookie cutter. Place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart
  on baking sheet; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake 8-10
  minutes or until well risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to
  cool.  When cold, split and serve with butter. Makes about 12 scones.

 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Appetizers
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
      6 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
      4 oz Creamed cheese
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      1 tb Chopped fresh dill, or 1 tsp
           -dried
      8    Sheets packaged phyllo dough
    1/2 c  Butter
 
  Throughout the Middle East, bureks are made by folding buttered,
  cheese-filled phyllo dough into little triangular shapes. Cigarro
  bureks taste the same but, as the name implies, are rolled into
  cylindrical shapes resembling small cigars.  Bureks, frozen unbaked,
  can go directly from the freezer into a preheated 375 F oven to make
  an instant hors d'oeuvre.
  
  Makes 40
  
  Defrost the phyllo dough and return the remainder to the freezer.
  Butter a cookie sheet.  Melt the butter and remove from the heat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F.
  
  Mix the feta and cream cheese with the egg and herbs and set aside.
  
  Layout one sheet of phyllo dough on a counter.  (Keep the remaining
  dough covered with a slightly damp towel to prevent its drying out.)
  Brush the sheet of dough with some melted butter. Cut it the short
  way into 5 strips, about 3x10 inches each.  Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of
  the filling at one end of each strip.  Roll the strips into cylinders
  about 1/2 inch in diameter. Continue until all of the dough has been
  cut, filled, and rolled.
  
  Arrange 2 to 3 cylinder per person on the cookie sheet and brush them
  with more butter.  (Freeze the rest of the cylinders, unbaked, for
  use at another time.) Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the
  cylinders are well browned and very flaky.

    1/4 c  Whipping cream
      2 lg Boneless chicken breasts
           - split
      4 sl Sharp jack or Cheddar cheese
           Salt and pepper
    1/2 c  Frying oil
 
  PLACE FLOUR IN A MIXING BOWL and slowly pour in the beer while
  mixing. Add the egg white, pepper and desired salt and mix well.
  Taste for salt and pepper and add if desired. Cover the bowl and set
  aside for 30 minutes before using. Combine onions and oil in a small
  Dutch oven or casserole, place in the oven and turn temperature to
  375F. If using fresh plum tomatoes, bring a pot of water to the boil,
  plunge in the plum tomatoes and cook a minute or so, until the skins
  crack. Drain tomatoes and when they are cool enough to handle, peel
  them. Discard peels, cut tomatoes in half crosswise and squeeze out
  seeds. Add tomatoes to the Dutch oven. Remove stems from the dried
  chili peppers and remove the seeds. Add peppers to the Dutch oven.
  Add cumin, cream and salt as desired. Cook 30 minutes, remove from
  the oven and scrape the contents into a blender or food processor.
  Blend until smooth and set aside. Meanwhile, place a piece of cheese
  under the skin of each breast, dredge each breast in flour and shake
  off the excess. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat on
  the stove. When the oil is hot enough for frying (350F), dip each
  breast in the beer batter and let the excess run off. Place skin-side
  down in the oil and fry until golden. Turn and fry other side, about
  1 minute per side. Remove breasts from the oil as they are done,
  drain on paper towels and transfer to a baking dish. Place the
  chicken breasts in a preheated 375F oven for 15 minutes. Place tomato
  sauce in a saucepan and reheat. (If the mixture is too thin, place it
  in a saucepan over high heat and boil down.) Pour the sauce onto a
  platter and arrange the chicken breasts on top.

      Title: CHEESE-STUFFED MANICOTTI
 Categories: Italian, Pasta, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------CHEESE FILLING----------------------------
    1/2 lb Fresh mozzarella cheese,
           1/2-inch dice
      2 lb Ricotta cheese (or 2
           15-ounce containers)
    1/4 lb Prosciutto, 1/4-inch dice
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Freshly graterd Parmesan
           Cheese
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
    1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley
     14    Manicotti shells
      3 c  Tomato sauce (Meat or
           Marinara)
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           Cheese
 
        TO MAKE THE FILLING:  combine all the filling ingredients and
  mix very thoroughly.
        Heat 4 to 6 quarts of salted water to the boil in a large pot;
  add 2 tablespoons oil to help prevent pasta from sticking. Add half
  of the manicotti and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until not quite al
  dente. Stir occasionally with a long-handled fork.  Hold a strainer
  over the pot and use a slotted spoon to remove 1 or 2 manicotti at a
  time from the boiling water, placing them in the strainer.  Shake
  manicotti free of water over the pot.  Spread a clean kitchen towel
  on the kitchen counter. Place the manicotti side by side on the
  towel, which will absorb all the remaining moisture.  (The shells
  must be completely dry before stuffing.) Repeat until all shells are
  cooked. Cool. Generously butter a baking dish, 13 x 10 inches. Fill
  each shell with some of the stuffing, letting a little of the
  stuffing come out on either end. This is best done with a pastry tube

 Categories: Groundmeat, Beef, Cheeses
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Thick hamburger patties
           -(pref. ground sirloin)
      2 sl Blue cheese big enough
           -to cover the  patties
      2 sl Sweet red onion
      4 sl Bacon, cooked until crisp
      2 sl Tomato (optional)
           Mayonnaise
           Salt, garlic powder,
           Coarse-ground pepper
      2    Kaiser rolls, split
 
  Preheat your grill, and toss on the hamburger patties and onion
  slices. Grill until the onions are nicely browned and the patties are
  done to your liking (medium rare around here). Add the split kaiser
  rolls, cut side down, a few minutes before the burgers are done, to
  allow the rolls to toast slightly.  When you put the rolls on the
  grill, also place the blue cheese slices on top of the hamburger
  patties.
  
  Spread toasted rolls lightly with mayonnaise, top with the patties,
  bacon slices, grilled onions, a tomato slice. Cover with the top of

      Title: CHEESECAKE (BELGIAN)
 Categories: Cheesecakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      2 c  Rolled oats (do not
           -use instant oatmeal
           -or steel-cut oats)
    2/3 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Butter, unsalted
           -(at room temperature)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
     11 oz Cream cheese
           -(at room temperature)
      3    Eggs
    3/4 c  Cottage cheese,
           -small-curd
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix crust ingredients with your hands
  until well blended.  Put the mixture in a 9-inch springform pan and
  form a crust, pushing it about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the pan.
  Bake the crust about 10 minutes at 350 degrees F. and let it cool.
  
  Beat (or mix) the filling ingredients, at very high speed, for seven
  minutes. The mixture must be very smooth. Put the filling in the baked
  crust.  You may want to re-form the crust slightly first.
  
  Bake for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees F.  The cheesecake is done when
  the filling is firm, but not dark (burned) on top. Let it cool, then
  chill it.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A moist cheesecake with a wonderful crust -- A college friend gave
  me this recipe, oh so many moons ago. It comes from his parents, and
  may have roots in Belgium. It is very different from the typical
  New-York-style dry cheesecake.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: CHEESECAKE - PIKE
 Categories: Cheesecakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    500 g  Graham cracker crumbs
    100 g  Melted butter
     20 g  White sugar
  2 1/2 ml Ground cinnamon
    700 g  Cream cheese
    150 g  Sugar

     60 ml Lemon juice
     10 ml Grated lemon rind
     10 ml Vanilla
    500 ml Sour cream
     30 g  Sugar
      5 ml Vanilla
    100 g  Sugar
     25 ml Cornstarch
      1 ml Salt
    170 ml Water
     75 ml Lemon juice
      1    Egg yolk -- WELL BEATEN.
     15 g  Butter
 
  1.  Preheat oven to 175 øC . Combine crust ingredients. Press crust on
  bottom and sides of buttered 25 cm springform pan. Bake 5 minutes, and
  cool.
  
  2.  Beat cheese until soft. Add sugar and blend well. Add eggs, one
  at a time, beating well after each. Mix in the lemon rind and the
  vanilla, and add to the mixture. Pour into the pre-baked crust, and
  bake 35 minutes.
  
  3.  Combine topping ingredients, spread on top of cheesecake, and
  return to oven immediately. Bake 10-12 minutes and remove from oven.
  
  4.  Combine dry glaze ingredients; add liquid glaze ingredients. Cook
  over low heat until thick. Add 15 g of butter. Cool, and spread this
  glaze on the cake before the glaze thickens too much.
  
  Author's Notes: This is from a dessert-chef friend of a regular-chef
  friend, and apparently won some award. I've had cheesecakes that I
  think are more impressive (including one I can make), but I think I'm
  something of a cheesecake connoisseur.  If I want to blow people's
  socks off, this is the one I cook. I think that every time I've
  served it to a new group, at least one person has said ``That was the
  best cheesecake I've ever had.''
  
  Some pointers: this is the traditional crust, but I often use a more
  floury-baked-pie-crust-like one. It's not too critical. The magic to
  getting the texture perfect is in howyou beat the cheese. I use a
  kitchen aid, work slowly, scrape the bowl often, and ALWAYS USE ROOM
  TEMPERATURE EVERYTHING. Using cold cream cheese guarantees lumps.
  Don't beat too hard before putting in the sugar, but make sure it's
  even and fluffy before the eggs go in. Then again, don't overbeat. It
  takes practice. I've been known to make it with no sugar or vanilla
  in the topping, and I think it's more interesting. but the contrast
  between the layers may confuse those accustomed to restaurant
  cheesecakes. The glaze is easy as glazes go, but treat it properly.
  In particular, stir constantly until it's thick, but don't stir hard
  or you'll break down the starch.
  
  Difficulty    : rather difficult (timing is critical.) Precision
  : measure carefully.

      Title: CHEESECAKE HINTS
 Categories: Desserts, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Cheesecake hints:
 
  Collected by Rita Taule on Prodigy:
  
  1.  Wrapping the pan with foil keeps it watertight.
  
  2. If you grease the sides of the pan first, the surface will not
  crack when the cake starts to shrink on cooling. (It always shrinks a
  little).
  
  3. Chill thoroughly before unmolding. In fact, I make my cheesecakes
  one day ahead of serving and leave it in the springform till I'm
  ready to use.
  
  4. The water bath pan must NOT be higher than the springform pan or
  it will slow down baking. Also, put no more than 1" of water in pan.
  
  5. Check oven temperature for accuracy.
  
  6. When done, turn oven off, DO NOT OPEN DOOR, let sit for one hour.
  Then remove, place on a rack, and let cool to room temperature (about
  1 hour). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
  
  7. Use 1 Tbl cornstarch per 2 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese. Use
  Philadelphia brand cream cheese.  It is the best and works EVERY time.
  
  8. IMPORTANT: Use  the egg size specified. If none is specified, use
  large (not jumbo or extra-large).

  creamy, about 3 minutes. Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze
  according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serve immediately, or
  pack the ice cream into a covered container and freezer for up to 24

           DIRECTIONS
 
   To make crust: Position rack in the center of the oven and preheat
  oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 9- or 10-inch springform pan with
  nonstick cooking spray.
   In a medium-sized bowl, stir together crumbs, cereal and oil. Press
  into the bottom of the prepared pan and set aside.
   To make filling: Place cottage cheese in a fine sieve and press down
  on it with a wooden spoon to drain off liquid. Put the pressed
  cottage cheese in a food processor and process until smooth. Add
  yogurt cheese, cream cheese, sugar, eggs, egg whites, cornstarch,
  vanilla, lemon zest and lemon juice and process until smooth. Spoon
  the mixture over the crust. Set the pan on a baking sheet and bake
  until just set, 40 to 45 minutes for a 10-inch cake or 50 to 55
  minutes for a 9-inch cake. remove from the oven and let stand at room
  temperature fo 15 minutes. Retain oven temperature at 350 degrees.
   To make topping: In a small bowl, stir together yogurt cheese,
  sugar, and vanilla. Spoon over the baked cheesecake, starting at the
  center and extending to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Return the
  cheesecake to the oven and bake for 5 minutes longer. Let cool on a
  rack. Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or for up to 3 days.
   To glaze cheesecake: Using a sharp knife, remove skin and white pith
  from oranges and discard. Cut segments away from their surrounding
  membranes and reserve. In a small saucepan, melt apricot preserves
  over low heat. Remove from the heat and stir in orange liqueur. With
  a pastry brush, brush about half of the apricot preserves mixture
  over top of the chilled cheesecake. Arrange kiwi fruit, orange
  segments and strawberries decoratively over top. Brush the remaining
  apricot preserves mixture over the fruit.

  in ovenproff dish. Sprinkle with cheese. Cut bacon in 2.5 cm pieces,
  fry until crisp and brown, drain, place over cheese, top with chopped
  shallots and chopped green pepper.
  
  Whisk eggs with fork, add milk, mustard, worcestershire sauce,
  mayonnaise, pepper and basil. Pour over bread mixture, top with
  chopped red pepper, cover with plastic food wrap, refrigerate
  overnight. Next day, bake uncovered in moderate oven (350 degrees)
  for 50 to 60 minutes.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  This dish looks pretty, layered with the colors.  The first time I
  made thi it was good, but it stuck to the pan. The next time I
  greased my pan, and did not stick. I also used a 9"x9" pan. It works,
  but it is very full and bakes quite tall.  Since they did not specify
  size of pan, you could probab use a larger pan. The picture looked
  like an oval white pfalzcraft cassero dish.
  
  This is one of the tastiest and handiest recipes we have created in
  the kitchen.  The whole dish is prepared, covered, refrigerated
  overnight and baked when you are ready the next day. It can be baked
  on the same day, but the flavor is not quite as good.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Rice; cooked
      1 ea Onion, small; chopped
      1 ea Green/Red Bell Pepper;Choppd
      1 x  Butter;Enough to saute veg's
      3 c  Chicken; cooked and cut up
      1 ea Ham, thick slice; cubed
      1 cn Condensed Cheddar Soup
    1/4 c  Milk
 
  Prepare rice according to directions or your desire.
   Set aside. Cut up the chicken into small chunks and cook through,
  either on the stove top or the microwave. You can either cook it and
  then cut it up, or cut it up and then cook it. Chop onion and peppers
  into small pieces.  Saute onion and pepper in the butter for about 4
  minutes or until tender. Cut up the ham slice into small cube-like
  pieces.
   (Although, any kind of ham, sliced, diced, cubed, would do). Stir in
  the cooked chicken, cubed ham, soup (straight from the can), and the
  milk. Heat until chicken is hot, stirring frequently. Stir the rice
  into the mixture and cook another few minutes until everything is
  hot. Be sure to mix in rice thoroughly. Will keep well if you prepare
  ahead and reheat before serving.  Just be sure to heat it and mix it
  again well before serving. Freezes well also if you want to make an
  extra batch.
  
  Yummy......

 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 tb Dry sherry
      1    Japanese eggplant cut into
           -small cubes
      6    8 mushrooms, sliced
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/4    Red pepper in 1/2 inch or
      1    Cm cubes
    1/2 ts Red pepper flakes (to
           -taste)
    1/2 c  Fatfree cottage cheese
    1/4 c  Fresh basil leaves, chopped
      2 tb Nutritional yeast (probably
           -optional)
 
  Soak the eggplant cubes in water for 5 minutes, drain & rinse off.
  Heat up the sherry and add eggplant & mushrooms, cover, and cook on
  low til done (took about 10 minutes, and there was quite a bit of
  liquid from the mushrooms).  Add garlic a few minutes into this
  (whenever it's chopped up :-)  When eggplant is almost done, add red
  pepper cubes & cook a few more minutes. Then, add the red pepper
  flakes, cottage cheese (I blended first in a mini food processor so
  it was smooth), basil, salt to taste. Mix and cook several more
  minutes. Add nut. yeast. I ate this on fresh linguine.
  
  The interesting effect that happened was that the sauce developed
  "threads" as if it had grated, melted real cheese (if you know what I
  mean). This happened before I added the nut. yeast (I added the nut.
  yeast to make it cheesier to take advantage of its texture).
    Any idea what combined to make this happen?  Could it be the cottage
  cheese (brand was Hood, and it was my first time adding that to a
  stovetop sauce) or the sherry (usually I saute just in water or
  stock)?
  
  Try this if you want to feel like you're eating pasta sauce w/cheese!
  I don't like that texture much myself, unfortunately.... but it was
  very realistic, complete to sticking to the fork as I ate! If you try
  it let me know how it comes out.  I still have the same ingredients
  on hand so I may try some more experiments with this combination,
  esp. since I do like cheesy lasagna....

  a little melted butter before cooking each crepe. Makes 10 to 12
  crepes. Select 8 crepes.
  
  FOR FILLING:
  
  Reserve 1/2 cup Havarti cheese. Combine remaining ingredients
  together. Place 1/2 cup cheese filling on each crepe and roll up.
  Place seam-side down in a greased 13x9-inch baking dish. Pour tomato
  sauce on top. Sprinkle with reserved Havarti cheese. Bake in a 375F
  oven, 20 to 25 minutes or until heated through.
  
  TIP: Double the crepe recipe if desired and make ahead. Separate
  crepes with pieces of wax paper and wrap in plastic wrap. Keep
  refrigerated for up to 3 days or wrap in foil and freeze. Crepes may
  be stuffed and rolled a day ahead. Top with sauce just before baking.

 Categories: Poultry, Mexican, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Skinless, boneless chicken
           -breast halves
           (about 1 1/2 pounds)
  1 1/2 c  Coarsely shredded Monterey
           -Jack cheese with
           Jalapeno peppers ( 8 ounces)
      2 ts Dried oregano, crumbled
    3/4 c  Yellow cornmeal
      1 tb Chili powder
    1/3 c  Flour
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Vegetable oil
           Guacamole and/or salsa
 
  Place each chicken breast half between waxed paper and pound very
  thin with a mallet or rolling pin to form a "cutlet". Be careful not
  to pound holes in the meat. Place 1/3 cup cheese in center of each
  "cutlet"; sprinkle with oregano.  Fold sides over to seal cheese,
  then roll up. Hold in place with wooden toothpick. Combine cornmeal
  with chili powder on sheet of waxed paper; place flour on another.
  Beat eggs slightly in a pie plate. Coat the stuffed rolls with flour;
  dip in egg then cornmeal mixture to coat well. Chill at least an
  hour.  (This much of the preparation can be done ahead). Preheat oven
  to 350 F. In a large skillet, heat oil until very hot. Quickly brown
  the stuffed chicken rolls, turning often, until golden. Lift out with
  a slotted spoon; drain well.  Place in a shallow baking pan. Bake 20
  minutes or until juices run clear when pierced with a small knife.
  Serve with guacamole and/or salsa.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  Cook and stir to a paste. At this point I add skim milk, about a cup.
  A cup of soy milk, or a cup of a mixture of nut butter and water
  coould be substituted. Add a tablespoon or so of nutritional yeast.
  Flavor to taste, I use salt, pepper, and a little good mustard. I am
  assuming you know how to work up a fat/flour mixture with added
  liquid to make a thickened sauce. My version isn't vegan but has the
  advantage of being relatively low-fat.

  won't take any more flour and you have a thick paste. Wisk in the
  room temp. milk `til it is silky smooth and free of lumps... 2) Pour
  this into an electric frying pan and simmer on low just to keep warm,
  stirring to prevent lumping. (you may add more milk ¬ c at a time to
  keep smooth, BUT NOT THIN)... 3) Add the remaining ingredients
  (except the pasta) wisking completely after each addition (adjusting
  for your personal taste)... 4) Prepare your pasta, (fresh is best if
  you can find it or make it), stirring the sauce occasionally... 5)

  Variations: a) With meat; Brown 1« lbs. of ground beef and 2 tb of
  dried minced onions in a frying pan. Drain off the fat and pour on
  top of the pasta before you pour on the sauce... b) With meatballs;
  Prepare your favorite meatball recipe and when they are done put them
  in the sauce and serve over the pasta... c) All together now; The way
  that we like it is; after the pasta is tender but not over cooked,
  add the ground beef, stirring to mix well, then add the sauce, again
  stirring to mix well...

      2 tb Vinegar; i use wine vinegar
      1 tb Dry mustard
 
  Hi again. This recipe was given to me by a chef friend at the Haiku
  Gardens Restaurant in Kaneohe on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. Have
  made it often. This restaurant is right out of "RAIN"" by Sommerset
  Maugham. It overlooks an awesome valley surrounded by the Koolau
  mountains. The royalty, Alii, used the valley as their exclusive
  summer hide away from the heat of the other side,leeward side, of the
  Island. I lived very near to it and in the Valley for a number of
  years. Place slivers of garlic along the bones and the base of the
  rack. Salt and pepper all over. Heat small amount of oil in a skillet
  to very hot and quickly brown meaty top side of rack only. Don't
  allow it to cook or burn. Place rack in a baking dish. While oven is
  preheating to 350* to 375*, make sauce. SAUCE: Heat to just below
  boiling point while stirring constantly Use to baste rack and as a
  sauce to serve with it. I usually doubled the recipe to have enough.
  Place baking dish on center rack of preheated oven. Pour 1/2 of the
  sauce over rack of lamb. Cook for about 20+ minutes but usually not
  more than 25 minutes per pound. Serve and accept the ovations from
  family and friends. BTW, this sauce makes a very good barbecue sauce.
  That's it, after posting these two recipes for rack of lamb I am out
  of here to get one for myself.:):) Really. I will post one last one
  later for you Elaine and other lamb lovers. It is nice to be able to
  get good lamb all year round now.

 Categories: Rice
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Imported Iranian rice -- or
           Substitute other
           White rice
           Salt
      4 ts Butter -- melted, plus 4
           Indiv
      4    Raw egg yolks
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Dried sumak -- a slightly
           Sour Pers
           Non-poisonous variety of
           Sumac (optional)
 
  If you are using Iranian rice, start at least 6 hours ahead. Spread
  it on a clean surface and pick out and discard any dark or discolored
  grains. Then wash it in a fine sieve or colander set under warm
  running water until the draining water runs clear. Finally place the
  rice in a large bowl or pot, add 1/4 cup of salt and enough cold
  water to cover it by about 1 inch and soak overnight, or for at least
  6 hours. If you are using other long-grain rice, wash it in the same
  way, but soak it in the salt water for about 2 hours.
  
  In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan equipped with a tightly fitting lid,
  bring 6 cups of fresh water to a boil over high heat. Drain the rice
  thoroughly and pour it into the boiling water. in a slow, thin stream
  so the water does not stop boiling. Stir once or twice, then boil
  briskly, uncovered for 5 minutes. Drain in a sieve.
  
  Pour 1 cup fresh water and the melted butter in the saucepan and pour
  in the parboiled rice, mounding it slightly in the middle of the pan.
  Cover the pan tightly with a strip of aluminum foil and set the lid
  in place. Simmer the rice over moderate heat to 15 to 20 minutes, or
  until the grains are tender and have absorbed all the liquid in the
  pan.
  
  Serve at once. Traditionally, when served with skewered broiled meat
  or chicken, the rice is served mounded into individual portions with
  a well in the center of each. A pat of butter is placed on top, a raw
  egg yolk is dropped in, and the top is sprinkled with salt, a
  grindings of pepper and if desired a little dried sumak.

    1/2 c  Green pepper, diced

      2 lb Tomatoes, crushed

      1 lb Tomatoes, whole,
           -cut up (canned or fresh)
      6 oz Tomato paste
  2 1/2 lb Kidney beans (light red),
           -not drained
           -(3 standard-size cans)
      2 tb Brown sugar
      3 tb Sugar, white
      4 tb Chili powder
      2 ts MSG (monosodium glutamate)
      2 ts Red pepper (cayenne),
           -crushed
      1 ts Black pepper, ground
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Bacon grease
           Water or beer,
           -as needed
           Garlic powder,
           -as needed
 
  In a large microwave container, brown meat, onions, green pepper and
  garlic for 15 minutes on full power. Drain off and reserve a cup or
  two of liquid. Break up any remaining large chunks of meat.
  
  Add remaining ingredients except tomato paste and cook on full power
  for 30 minutes covered.  Stir and taste. Cook for 1 hour at 70
  percent power, uncovered.  Stir and taste at half hour intervals. Add
  water as necessary.
  
  Add tomato paste and reserved meat liquid.  Cook 30 minutes at 60
  percent power, uncovered.  Stir and taste. The chili is done and can
  be served directly or decanted into a crock pot to simmer.
  
  Serve with shredded cheddar cheese, tabasco sauce, diced onions, hot
  chili oil, red pepper flakes and hot dogs with rolls. Your guests can
  microwave their own hot dogs and top them with chili and cheese!!!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  High-energy microwave chili -- Microwaves and chili make a superb
  match, especially for lazy chili lovers like me. This version is for
  a mixed crowd. True chili fiends should see the notes at the end.
  Yield: Serves 8-12.
  
  *  For true CHERNOBYL-Class 20 megaton SS-19 chili, double the pepper,
  chili powder and MSG and add 30 minutes to the cooking. Serve with
  Pepski.
  
  *  People who are worried about MSG, bacon grease or radiation should
  not be eating chili in the first place.
  
  *  Yes, it will make an incredible mess in your microwave oven.
  
  *  The most likely things you will need to add at the testing points
  are salt, sugar, and maybe garlic powder.
  
  *  The chili will thicken up in the microwave so be sure to add enough
  water to keep it soupy until the last phase.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 2-3 hours in microwave.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHERRIES - WHOLE (SWEET OR SOUR)
 Categories: Fruits, Canning
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 17-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
  quarts; an average of 11 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
  A lug weighs 25 pounds and yields 8 to 12 quarts--an average of 2-1/2
  pounds per quart.
  
  Quality: Select bright, uniformly colored cherries that are mature (of
  ideal quality for eating fresh or cooking).
  
  Procedure: Stem and wash cherries. Remove pits if desired. If pitted,
  place cherries in water containing ascorbic acid (See "Ensuring
  High-Quality Canned Foods") to prevent stem-end discoloration. If
  canned unpitted, prick skins on opposite sides with a clean needle to
  prevent splitting. Cherries may be canned in water, apple juice,
  white-grape juice, or syrup. If syrup is desired, select and prepare
  preferred type as directed.
  
  Hot pack--In a large saucepan add 1/2 cup water, juice, or syrup for
  each quart of drained fruit and bring to boil. Fill jars with
  cherries and cooking liquid, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.
  
  Raw pack--Add 1/2 cup hot water, juice, or syrup to each jar. Fill
  jars with drained cherries, shaking down gently as you fill. Add more

      Yield: 1 Quart

MMMMM--------------------FOODS OF THE HUDSON-------------------------
      5 lb Sweet cherries
      1 qt Rum
           Brown sugar
 
  Wash and stem cherries.  Crush them between your fingers. Pour the
  rum over them and let them stand 1 week. Stir them every day. After 1
  week, strain them into a bottle or screwtop jar that has been rinsed
  with boiling water. Measure the juice, and add sugar in proportion -
  for every gallon (see Sue's note) of juice, add 3/4 lb. brown sugar.
  Allow the Bounce to stand 6 weeks before serving.  I keep it in the
  refrigerator, it is very nice cold or poured over ice cubes.
  
  Sue's note - as written in the cookbook, it does say "for every
  gallon" - perhaps they meant quart?

      Title: CHERRY BREAD PUDDING
 Categories: Vegetables, August, Ovo lacto
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Eggs or equivalent egg
           Substitute
    1/4 c  Dark honey (or 3x this if
           You want it sweet)
  1 1/2 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
           (approx)
        x  Micro dash of salt
      8 sl Cracked wheat bread
      1 c  Dried pitted cherries
    1/2 c  Organic red flame raisins
           Spice (optional)
 
  Boil some water, pour over cherries and raisins to soak, set aside.
  
  Beat the eggs and honey with a fork until well blended. Stir in
  yogurt and salt.  Break up about 8 slices of cracked wheat bread, or
  crumble it up, and stir in. Add in plumped up cherries and raisins,
  drain the water off first.  Pour into a greased 5" x 7" pan, or a
  large pie tin. Bake 400 F until the aroma of bread pudding hits your
  nose, about 40 minutes.
  
  Serve with a little cinnamon sprinkled on top.
  
  Notes: This is just right in terms of sweetness for me. In order to
  try to placate the sugar gods, I tried it out with caramel sauce, and
  it ruined it for me. Nothing like the taste of burnt sugar to dull
  one's taste buds. Nonetheless, the caramel sauce recipe follows.

      Title: CHERRY CREAM CHEESE PIE
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      1    Pie shell
           -(graham cracker)
      8 oz Cream cheese
    1/2 c  Sour cream
    1/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla (or to taste)
      4 oz Whipped cream
     14 oz Cherry pie filling
           -(1 can)
 
  Cream together the cheese and sour cream.  Fold in sugar gradually.
  Add vanilla and mix well.  Fold in whipped cream. Pour into pie shell
  and chill for at least 3 hours.
  
  Pour excess syrup from the can of cherry pie filling. Leave some, but
  you certainly don't need all of it. The sauce should cover the cream
  cheese mix, but the cherries shouldn't be drowning in it. Pour pie
  filling on top. Serve cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple cherry cream cheese pie -- My wife makes this for me
  periodically, and it is always delicious. No baking is required, and
  it is very easy to make. Yield: Makes one pie.
  
  *  If you don't have the time to sit around for 3 hours waiting for
  the pie to chill, make the cream cheese filling the night before and
  let the pie chill overnight.
  
  *  We prefer to use non-dairy whipped cream substitute. We usually
  use the same brand name ingredients for best results: Philadelphia
  cream cheese, Breakstone's sour cream, Cool-whip and Comstock cherry
  pie filling.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK, especially with the vanilla.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Margarine
      1 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 cn Cherry Pie Filling or 1 lg
           TOPPING:
      2 tb Margarine
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Flour
 
    Cream margarine and sugar, and beat until light. Add eggs, one at a
  time, beating after each until well blended. Add vanilla, 2 c. flour,
  and baking powder. Beat until light and fluffy. Spread dough evenly
  on lightly greased 11x17 UTILITY or CAKE PAN--***MUST HAVE SIDES**.
  (Note: I also use a small 8" cake pan with this) Spread top with
  cherry pie filling. Sprinkle topping made by cutting and blending the
  margarine, sugar and flour.
     Bake at 350 about 25 mins or until edges are light brown. This is
  also good with blueberry pie filling, or black raspberry. *Variation
  is to use fresh cherries, drained and dried. Then press cherries
  about an inch apart in the dough. ****WARNING---do not use my
  mother's variation. She used a cookie sheet. Stuff went over sides
  into oven and caused a FIRE. Oven was fine but dessert was not. Was
  rushed and dumped in front yard. It burned a spot out of the lawn and
  its identity resembled everything from burned bacon to um, dog
  deposits!.

     30 oz Tart Cherry Pie Filling
      3 c  Vegetable Oil
 
  Here is a genuine Fake Chinese Recipe.
  
  Powdered Sugar Or Cinnamon Sugar
  
  To assemble wontons, place approximately 1 1/2 Tsp Cherry Pie Filling
  (2 cherries plus sauce) in the center of each wonton wrapper. Mositen
  the edges of each wrapper, bring one corner up over the filling to
  the opposite corner at an angle so that two overlapping triangles are
  formed. Pull the two bottom corners of the folded triangle forward so
  that they meet one another and slighly overlap. Moisten one end and
  pinch the two ends firmly together.  Repeat.
  
  Pour the oil into a deep fryer and heat to 375 degrees F. Deep fry the
  wontons, 8 to 10 at a time for about two minutes or until crisp and
  golden. Drain on paper towels.
  
  Fried wontons can be kept warm for about one hour in a 250 degree F.
  oven or reheated for 5 minutes in a 450 degree F. oven. Powdered
  sugar or cinnamon sugar can be sprinkled on the fried wontons, if
  desired.
  
  NOTE:  Cherry dessert wontons can be assembled and frozen. To use,
  let thaw for 10 minutes and fry as above.

      Title: CHERYL'S BLUEBERRY LEMON CRISP
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  6 1/2 c  Blueberries
  1 1/2    To 4 teaspoons grated fresh
           Lemon peel, depending on how
           Tart you like it
           A few pinches flour
           TOPPING:
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
 
  Put the blueberries in a large but shallow baking dish. You can vary
  the amount of blueberries by half a cup either way without making any
  difference; 6 1/2 cups is what I happened to have on hand.
  
  Lightly sprinkle a few pinches of flour over the blueberries to help
  absorb the berry juice.  You can omit the flour if you want; if you
  do, there will be more leftover berry juice in the bottom of the pan.
  
  Sprinkle the lemon peel over the berries.  The tartness of fresh
  lemon peel balances the sweetness of the berries and topping, so use
  the amount that suits your personal taste. Then go change the name of
  the recipe and put your own name in; you've customized it, you
  deserve it! :)  Reduce the amount of lemon peel if you decide to cut
  back on the amount of topping.
  
  Mix together the remaining ingredients; it will be easier if the
  butter and brown sugar are nice and soft. Sprinkle the mix on the
  berries. Bake for 25 minutes at 275-degrees F.

      Title: CHERYL'S SOURDOUGH STARTER
 Categories: Sourdough, Breads, Cheryl
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------CHERYL GAVARD----------------------------
      1 c  -water
      1 c  Milk
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts -salt
      2 c  Flour
      1 tb White vinegar
 
  Mix all together, and let sit on your counter for 3 days with a loose
  fitting lid or cover with Saran Wrap. On the third day stir it well.
  Let sit for two more days. Some recipes call for adding 1 packet of
  yeast that has been dissolved in 1/2 cup warm water on the fifth day.
  It sort of speeds up the process of it getting sour. If you do add
  it, then let the mix sit out for at least one more week, stirring it
  every day. If you don't add it, you still have to let it sit out a
  week, but, it may not be as sour the first few times you use it.
  Store starter in the fridge. It will separate, into two parts, a
  darkish liquid on the top ~ this is normal. Before you use it, stir
  the liquid back into the bottom part. ALWAYS use a wooden or plastic
  spoon. NEVER use metal. Always use glass, ceramic or plastic
  bowls...NEVER metal. To use:   Pour out the amount needed. For 1/2
  cup starter used, feed with 1/2 cup flour and 1 teaspoon sugar. Stir
  in well. Don't worry about flour lumps etc. Let sit out on the
  counter with a loose lid overnight! Stir, return to refrigerator.
  (According to Cheryl & Connie, you have to wait at least 3 or 4 days
  between used!) IF you don't use within a week, feed starter 1
  teaspoon sugar, stir in and return to fridge. It's NOT that
  hard...and of all the starters I've used, this one so far has been
  the best. Thanks Cheryl and Connie! Repost by SALLIE KRATZ NXMB21A

      1 ts Sharp prepared mustard
      1 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
      6 tb Olive oil, divided
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 lb Lump crabmeat, picked clean
    1/2 c  Dry, unflavored bread crumbs
      1 pn Of cayenne pepper
      4 tb Butter
 
  Chesapeake Bay Crab Cakes
  
  Parsley, lemon wedges, tartar sauce as desired
  
  Using an electric blender or wire whisk, beat together mustard, lemon
  juice and egg until thoroughly combined. While beating vigorously,
  gradually pour 4 Tbs of olive oil into the egg mixture in a thin
  stream. When smooth and creamy, stir in salt and pepper.
  
  Gently fold in crabmeat, then bread crumbs and cayenne pepper. Shape
  into 8 patties, each about a half-inch thick. They will want to fall
  apart, but that's the idea of a good crab cake. You want only enough
  non-crab stuff to just barely bind them.
  
  Melt  butter together with 2 Tbs of olive oil in skillet over medium
  heat. When butter sizzles (but before it burns!) gently ease the crab
  cakes into the skillet to cook. When well browned (2 to 3 minutes),
  gently turn and cook  other  side. Drain on paper towels. Serve
  immediately.
  
  Makes 4 main-course servings, 8 appetizers

  Trying to preserve whole pieces of crabmeat, combine first 8
  ingredients in medium bowl. Using 1/3 - 1/2 cup for each cake, shape
  mixture into 6 cakes. Gently coat cakes with breadcrumbs; place cakes
  on plate and refrigerate 2 hours. Melt butter in 10" skillet. Brown
  crab cakes in butter until golden on both sides and heated through.
  Cakes will keep in refrigerator 3-4 days and in the freezer 2 months.
  To reheat, wrap in foil and warm in preheated 325 degree oven for 10
  minutes or refry in a skillet with a little butter.

 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
      1 sm Onion
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 sm Tomato
      1 c  Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Brown rice, cooked
      2 oz Dried chestnuts
      2 tb Water
      1 ts Yeast extract
      1 ts Tomato paste
 
  Cover the chestnuts with boiling water and leave them to soak for
  several hours, then cook them until tender. (If the chestnuts are
  soaked in warm water in a wide-rimmed thermos flask, or in a warm
  cupboard, them may be tender enough not to require more cooking.)
  
  Chop the onion and saute it in the oil in a saucepan for about 3
  minutes.
  
  Skin and chop the tomato.  Slice the mushrooms.  Add them to the pan
  and cook for a further 3 minutes or so.
  
  Add the rice and chestnuts to the pan and stir well. Then add the
  water, yeast extract and tomato paste. Mix together very thoroughly
  as it heats up so that the yeast extract is amalgamated evenly into
  the mixture. Continue cooking over a gentle heat until all the
  ingredients are well heated.

  2 1/4 c  Heaping cups (roughly 1/2lb
           -unshelled chestnuts, peeled

           -blanched, peeled, and
           -put through food mill
      5    Egg whites
           Unsalted butter
           Flour

MMMMM------------------CHOCOLATE WHIPPED CREAM-----------------------
      3 oz Semisweet chocolate
      1 c  Heavy cream, whipped

MMMMM-----------------------APRICOT GLAZE----------------------------
      3 tb Apricot jam
      1 tb Dark rum

MMMMM----------------------CHOCOLATE ICING---------------------------
      4 oz Semisweet chocolate
      6 tb Unsalted butter
 
  Preheat oven to 350 deg F. Beat yolks and sugar until very light and
  fluffy. This will take several minutes even with an electric beater.
  The end product should have an off-white color. Add chestnuts and run
  to yolk-sugar mixture. Blend together and add half the almonds. Beat
  egg whites to stiff peaks and fold into mixture. Next, fold in rest
  of almonds and pour mixture into a buttered, floured, 10x2.5 inch
  spring mold. Place filled mold in oven. After 10 minutes, reduce heat
  to 325 deg F and bake for 35 to 50 minutes more, until cake has
  pulled away slightly from sides of mold. Remove from oven, let cool,
  unmold, and cut into two layers of equal thickness, leaving spring
  mold bottom attached to bottom of 1 layer. Apply chocolate whipped
  cream to top of bottom layer and arrange the other layer on top of
  that. Several hours before serving, glaze top of top layer with hot
  apricot glaze. When glaze has set, prepare icing. Balance cake in one
  hand, with hand under spring mold bottom, and dribble icing over top
  of cake. Tilt cake back and forth to coat evenly. Put cake on a rack
  and finish icing sides with a table knife or spatula. Refrigerate
  until icing sets. CHOCOLATE WHIPPED CREAM FILLING:
    Place chocolate and 3 tb water in a small pan, over low flame. Stir
  until
    chocolate melts into water and mixture is smooth. Start with 3 tb
  water
    and add more if necessary for smooth texture.
    Cool, but do not refrigerate. Combine with whipped cream. APRICOT
  GLAZE:
    Heat jam until it thickens slightly.
    Add rum off heat and apply immediately to cake. CHOCOLATE ICING:
    Soften chocolate in a double boiler over simmering water.
    Add butter to chocolate. When butter melts, stir it into chocolate
  until
    mixture is smooth and all lumps have disappeared. If icing is too
  thick
    to pour, add more butter. If it is too loose, add a small amount of
    chocolate. It should coat the spoon heavily and drip slowly off.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  **** Chestnuts are versatile and low in fat.
  
  One ounce of chestnuts contains 60 calories and 0.6g of fat.
  Chestnuts are the only nut approved by the low-fat Pritikin System.
  They are high in carbohydrates.
  
  California's crop, grown around Sacramento, comes in during Sept, but
  imported Italian nuts are here until the first of the year.
  
  Substitute the nuts for other nut types in poultry and wild game
  stuffings, breads or cinnamon roll recipes.
  
  Fresh chestnuts must be cooked before being included in recipes. To
  prepare them for baking, preheat the oven to 400 deg F. Using a
  short-bladed or chestnut knife, carve an X onto the flat side of each
  nut to prevent it from bursting.
  
  Place the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast in the
  preheated oven 15 - 20 min.  (They also may be cooked in the
  microwave for about 5 min at full power.) The nuts should be mealy in
  the center when pierced with the tip of a knife.  Remove immediately
  from the baking sheet to a thick, clean cloth.  When barely cool
  enough to handle, crack the nuts with your hands and use the same
  knife to peel off the outer shell and then the funny inner skin.  (At
  this point you may cover the whole nuts tightly and refrigerate until
  needed.) Coarsely chop the nuts and set aside.

MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
      1 ts Sweetened hot chocolate mix
 
  Grease several baking sheets; line with parchment or waxed paper.
  Preheat oven to 275 F (135 C). In a very clean grease-free bowl, beat
  egg whites until very stiff, but not dry. Add 1/2 tablespoon of the
  1/2 cup sugar; beat until sugar is incorporated and meringue is stiff
  and shiny. Add remaining sugar, a little at a time, beating well
  after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Carefully fold in chopped
  marrons glaces. Using two small teaspoons, spoon small oval shapes of
  mixture onto prepared baking sheets. Lightly sprinkle remaining 2
  teaspoons sugar over meringues. Bake meringues 1-1/4 hours or until
  crisp and dry on outside, but soft in the center; cool. Sift hot
  chocolate mix lightly over each meringue. Remove meringues from paper.

           -(should be whole wheat)
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Oil

MMMMM------------------------FOR COATING-----------------------------
           Dried breadcrumbs
 
  Melt the butter (or substitute) and saute the onion and celery over
  moderate heat for 10 minutes until soft but not brown. Transfer to a
  large bowl.  Drain the chestnuts and add to the bowl. Mix these
  ingredients together well.
  
  Mash the chestnuts, onion and celery, then mix into the bowl the
  chopped parsley, lemon juice and garlic.
  
  The mixture should be soft but firm enough to form into a roll, so
  add a few whole-wheat breadcrumbs, if necessary, especially if you're
  using canned chestnuts. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to
  taste.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Pour a little of the oil into a roasting
  pan and put into the oven to heat.
  
  Form the chestnut mixture into a roll about 8 inches long, pressing it
  together carefully, then coat it well with the dried breadcrumbs. Put
  the chestnut roll into the roasting pan and carefully turn it so that
  it is coated with hot oil.
  
  Bake for 45 minutes, until it is crisp on the outside, spooning a
  little more of the oil over the roll from time to time during the
  cooking. Serve the Chestnut Roast cut into slices.

    250 g  Dried chestnuts
      3 dl Milk

           Sugar and butter for the
           -- souffle dish
 
  Soak the chestnuts for 12 hours in cold water and drain (dried
  chestnuts are used because they have a stronger flavour than fresh
  ones). Cook with the milk for 20 minutes on a very low heat and then
  make a puree. Mix together with the softened butter, sugar, vanilla
  sugar and the grappa (brandy, if you don't have grappa). Add the egg
  yolks one by one, mixing well. Leave to cool then fold in the beaten
  egg whites. Put the mixture into a buttered and sugared souffle dish
  and bake at 180-190 oC for about 40 minutes. Dust with icing sugar
  and serve immediately, with a little whipped cream, if desired.

      Title: CHESTNUT SOUP WITH AMARETTO
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Chestnuts, fresh
      2    Carrot
      2    Parsnip
      1    Onion, small
      1    Garlic clove
      2    Scallion
      3    Celery stalk
      4 tb Butter
      5 c  Brown stock
           Bouquet garni
      3 tb Amaretto liqueur
      1 c  Cream, heavy
           Salt; to taste
           Pepper, black; to taste
           Cayenne pepper
           Nutmeg
 
  Make a slash in the rounded side of each chestnut and roast in a pre-
  heated 400 F. oven for 5 minutes. Peel off the shell and inner skin.
  Peel the carrots, parsnip, onion, and garlic. Finely chop all of the
  vegetables, including the scallions and celery.  Melt the butter in a
  large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the vegetables and cook for
  five minutes, or until soft but not brown.  Add the chestnuts, stock,
  and bouquet garni. Gently simmer the soup for 40 minutes, or until
  the chestnuts are very soft.
  
  Remove the bouquet garni and puree the soup in a blender or food pro-
  cessor.  Return the soup to the saucepan, adding the amaretto, two-
  thirds of the cream, and salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and nutmeg to
  taste; the soup should be very flavorful.  If a sweeter flavor is
  desired, add a spoonful of brown sugar.
  
  To serve, ladle the chestnut soup into warmed bowls. Pour a little of
  the remaining cream into each bowl and marble it into the soup,
  stirring with a skewer. Chestnut soup is extremely rich, so keep the
  rest of the meal simple.

           Small croutons, fried
           -(in butter or oil)
           -(optional)
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Score chestnuts on their rounded sides and toss
  them in just enough oil to lightly coat them. Place chestnuts on
  baking sheet. Bake until skins have opened and meat is tender, about
  20 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel and dice them into small
  pieces. Set aside. Rinse lentils and combine them in soup pot with
  the water. Bring to boil. Cook a few minutes at gentle boil, removing
  foam that forms on surface. Add carrot, celery, onion, garlic, bay
  leaf, salt and parsley. Lower heat and simmer until lentils are
  tender, about 35 minutes. When done, remove parsley sprigs and bay
  leaf. Correct seasoning and add salt, if necessary. Puree half the
  lentils until smooth, then recombine them with the rest. FINISHING
  THE SOUP: In pan large enough to hold soup, warm olive oil, then add
  roasted chestnuts and herbs. Cook over medium heat, stirring
  frequently, for several minutes. Add wine and tomato paste. Stir to
  dissolve tomato paste and cook a few minutes to reduce wine. Stir in
  lentil mixture and simmer gently 20 minutes. If soup is too thick,
  thin it with a little water, stock or cream until of right
  consistency. Taste for salt and season with pepper. Serve with
  spoonful of olive oil swirled into each bowl. Sprinkle with parsley
  and croutons, if desired. ---

      Title: CHESTNUT-STUFFED MUSHROOMS
 Categories: Side dish, Appetizers, Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 lg Open mushrooms
           Olive oil; for frying

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE STUFFING---------------------------
      1 oz Butter or vegan margarine
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
     12 oz Whole cooked chestnuts
           Fresh lemon juice
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Grated nutmeg

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE CROUTES---------------------------
      8 sl Wholemeal bread
      2 oz Soft butter
 
  If you're making the coutes, it's a good idea to get them done in
  advance and out of the way.  You can fry them, but I think they're
  much nicer baked to a crisp golden crunchiness in a slow oven. Set
  the oven to 150 C (300 F, Gas Mark 2).  Stamp circles in the bread
  with a large pastry cutter; spread on both sides with butter and put
  them on a baking sheet. Bake for 1 hour, or until completely crisp
  and golden.  Cool. These will keep in a tin for a few days.
  
  To prepare the mushrooms, cut off any stalks so that the surface is
  level, then wash the mushrooms and pat them dry on kitchen paper. Fry
  them on both sides with olive oil and drain well. Season them with
  salt and pepper, then leave on one side while you make the stuffing.
  
  Melt the butter in a medium-large saucepan.  Add the onion and fry for
  about 7 minutes, until soft.
  
  Chop up any pieces of mushroom stalk, add these and cook for a minute
  or two longer.  Remove from the heat and add the cooked chestnuts,
  breaking them up a bit as you do so to make a mixture which holds
  together but has some chunky bits in it.  Add a dash of fresh lemon
  juice, and salt, pepper and grated nutmeg to taste.
  
  To serve the dish, preset the oven to 200 C (400 F, Gas Mark 6), or
  preheat the grill to high.  Put the croutes on a baking sheet or in a
  shallow casserole, then place a mushroom on each one, black side up.
  Spooon the stuffing mixture on top.  Bake or grill until heated
  through -- about 10 minutes under the grill, 15-20 minutes in the
  oven.
  
  [Note from Karen: There's a gorgeous photo of this dish in the book.
  The stuffed mushrooms are each garnished with three or four extremely
  thin slivers of lemon peel. Looks absolutely beautiful.]

           Text
 
  Still got those chestnuts sitting around?  Here's what Ken Hom has to
  say about preparing fresh chestnuts or use in Chinese cooking, along
  with a recipe for a braised dish in which they can be used. The
  recipe doesn't specify how many chestnuts to use so use your own
  discretion.
  
  "The Chinese use the same Western chestnut with its sweet flavor and
  soft, mealy texture in stir fried dishes and stews like Chinese Beef
  Stew and in stuffings.  Shop for large, dark brown chestnuts in the
  fall, when they are in season.  Dried chestnuts, once soaked, can be
  used like fresh chestnuts.
  
  1. Boil the chestnuts for 30 minutes, shells on.
  
  2. Peel the outer skin first.
  
  3.  Peel the inner skin, revealing the golden meat. Chestnuts are
  usually used either whole or split in half.

      Title: CHESTNUTS FOR THE HOLIDAYS
 Categories: Holidays &, Information, Tips, Misc., Eat-lf mail
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  **** Chestnuts For The Holidays Roasting chestnuts is often a
  tradition during the holidays. Storage conditions have to be just
  right, not too dry and not too damp. In dry air, they dry out and
  lose quality. In warm, damp air, they mold. Store fresh chestnuts in
  the refrigerator in a plastic bag with a few ventilation holes
  punched in it. Chestnuts can be cooked by roasting, boiling or
  steaming. To roast over an open fire, use a long handled popcorn
  popper or chestnut roaster. To roast in an oven, try a temperature of
  300 degrees Fahrenheit for about
       15    minutes. Before roasting, puncture each nut once or twice
  with an icepick or a knife. If you fail to do this, pressure from
  steam building up inside the shells will cause the nuts to explode,
  either before or after they come out of the oven or roaster. To boil
  chestnuts, place them in a shallow pan with water that just covers
  them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and boil gently for 15 to
       20    minutes. Drain and partially cool, then remove the kernels
  using a sharp tine of a table fork. The longer the nuts cook, the
  mealier the kernels become and tend to crumble when removed from the
  shells. For especially dry chestnuts, soak them overnight in water
  before boiling in fresh water. For steaming, carefully cut fresh,
  moist chestnuts in half and cook them in a vegetable steamer over
  boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Most kernels should fall out of
  the shells during cooking. Steamed or boiled nuts can be dipped in
  melted butter and salted, if desired, or used in other recipes. Store
  cooked chestnuts in tightly sealed jars in the refrigerator for a
  month or two or in the freezer for up to a year. (MJM)

      Title: CHESTNUTS IN COINTREAU SYRUP
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits, Grains, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  1 1/2 lb Chestnuts (about 50 nuts)
      2 lg Fresh tangerines; peel of
           -- pith removed
           -- in large chunks
    3/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  ;Water
    1/3 c  Light corn syrup
      1 tb Orange zest; finely slivered
    1/3 c  Cointreau or
           Other orange-flavor liqueur*
 
  *Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, etc.
  
  Chop each chestnut in half with a cleaver or heavy knife (lay them
  flat side down on a cutting board for easy chopping.) Place the nuts
  in a saucepan, add water to cover by 1", and bring them to a boil
  over high heat.  Boil the nuts, uncovered, 3 minutes, then drain
  them. Pry or pop the halves out of the shells. The skin will usually
  remain in the shell; scrape off any bits that adhere to the nuts.
  Halve each piece.
  
  Return nuts to the rinsed-out saucepan; add the skin of one tangerine
  and enough cold water to cover the nuts. Bring the liquid to a boil,
  lower heat, and simmer the nuts gently, partly covered, until they are
  translucent, about 1 hour.  If necessary, add more boiling water to
  keep the nuts covered.  Using a slotted spoon, lift the nuts from the
  cooking liquid, leaving any scum behind. Discard the liquid and peel.
  
  Combine the sugar, water and remaining tangerine peel in the
  rinsed-out saucepan; bring the mixture to a boil. Simmer the syrup 10
  minutes, then add the chestnuts. Bring the syrup to a boil again,
  then lower heat and simmer the chestnuts, covered, for 15 minutes.
  Remove the pieces of zest; return the sauce to boiling and simmer it
  for 3 minutes.
  
  Ladle the nuts and syrup into a sterilized storage jar and add orange
  liqueur. Cover the jar, shaking it to mix everything, then cool and
  refrigerate.  The flavor improves for several weeks. Stores for up to
  a year in the refrigerator.
  
  The author suggests spooning this sauce into stemmed glasses and
  topping it with lightly whipped cream, or serving it as an ice cream
  topping.
  
  Yield: About 2 1/2 cups.

 Categories: Pasta, Poultry, Cheese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Half and half
      8 oz Plain chevre
      2    Cloves garlic -- minced
    3/4 c  Coarsely chopped toasted
           Walnuts
    1/3 c  Finely chopped parsley
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper -- to taste
 
  1. In a medium saucepan combine half-and-half, chevre, and garlic.
  Heat, stirring until mixture is creamy and smooth. Bring to a boil.
  2. Boil gently about 10 minutes to thicken sauce and reduce it to
  about 2-1/4 cups. Stir occasionally at first, then frequently the
  last few minutes to prevent scorching. 3. Remove from heat; stir in
  walnuts and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Use
  immediately or cool to room temperature and refrigerate or freeze
  (see Timesaver Tip). 4. To serve: Cook 1-1/4 to 1-1/3 pounds fresh or
  frozen fettucine, or 12 ounces dried, following package directions.
  Drain. Toss with sauce. Makes 2-1/4 cups (4 main-dish or 6 appetizer
  servings). * Timesaver Tip: Sauce can be made up to 6 hours ahead,
  covered and refrigerated, or it can be frozen. To freeze, spoon into
  a freezer container, cover, label, and freeze at 0 degrees F up to 1
  month. To serve, defrost sauce 12 to 18 minutes in microwave oven on
  Defrost setting, stirring several times, or thaw in refrigerator 8 to
  24 hours. Gently warm sauce in a saucepan, or in a microwave oven on
  50% power until warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes, whisking vigorously
  and frequently to bring sauce to a creamy consistency.

      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Baking powder
     24 oz Chocolate chips
           -(being a purist,
           -I prefer Toll House
           -morsels)
      8 oz Chocolate bar,
           -finely grated
      3 c  Chopped nuts
           -(I prefer walnuts,
           -but use your favorite)
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the
  sugars.
  
  Sift together flour, oatmeal, salt, baking soda, baking powder and
  shredded chocolate bar.  Add eggs and vanilla to creamed sugar and
  butter, then mix all ingredients together. Mix chocolate chips and
  nuts into mixture.
  
  Drop by onto ungreased cookie sheet in small drops. Bake 6 minutes or
  until done.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate Chip Cookies like Mrs. Fields makes -- These cookies are
  a combination of oatmeal and chocolate chip. They are very rich, but
  very tasty. The recipe was obtained from a friend of a friend, who
  supposedly paid a large amount of money for it. However, the cookies
  do not taste exactly the same as the name brand. Yield: approximately
  60.
  
  *  A blender works very well to powder the oats and the chocolate
  bar. The blender chops the oatmeal finer than a food processor. The
  powdered chocolate bar should melt at the touch of your fingers.
  
  *  I prefer my cookies just barely done, so that they remain chewy.
  If you want to send your taste buds into heaven, butter the cookies
  as they come out of the oven (still hot), and eat them still warm
  with a glass of cold milk.
  
  *  Note that cocoa is not the same thing as a shredded chocolate bar.
  Note also that oatmeal is not the same thing as quick-cooking oats or
  instant oatmeal. Oatmeal means "rolled oats," such as Quaker oats.

  Raisin Puree is the basis for the dough of this rich-tasting, chewy
  bar. The combination of orange and chocolate is a classic favorite. We
  considered cutting the amount of chocolate in the recipe, thereby
  cut- ting the fat, but in the end we agreed that the extra richness
  is worth the extra grams of fat. (By Times Food Stylists) Sift
  together flour, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Stir in oats
  and brown sugar. Beat egg whites lightly in another bowl. Stir in
  Raisin Puree. Stir into flour mixture along with chocolate, walnuts,
  and orange zest just until blended. Spoon in 9-inch-square baking pan

      Title: CHEZ PANISSE PASTRY CRUST
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    3/8 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Sugar
      5 tb Cold salted butter
  6 1/2 tb Cold unsalted butter
      3 tb Vegetable shortening
      3 tb Ice water; plus
      1 ts Ice water
 
  This is a good basic pie crust recipe from Lindsey Shere at Chez
  Panisse. It is flaky and has a good butter flavor.
  
  MIX THE FLOUR, SALT AND SUGAR in a bowl. Cut the salted butter in
  pieces 1/3-inch thick and quickly cut them into the flour mixture
  until it is the texture of cornmeal. You can do this with a pastry
  blender, with your hands by rubbing quickly and lightly between your
  fingers, or in an electric mixer or food processor. Cut in the
  unsalted butter and the vegetable shortening until they are in larger
  pieces, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch in diameter. This helps to make the
  dough flaky. Sprinkle in the 3 tablespoons ice water, tossing the
  dough lightly with a fork to moisten it evenly. Use another teaspoon
  of water if necessary to make the dough hold together. Stir the dough
  with the fork until it has come together in small lumps and there is
  no dry flour left. Divide the dough in half and press it into two
  balls. Be careful not to knead it--just squeeze it together. Kneading
  activates the gluten, which makes the dough tough. However, if the
  dough is crumbly, knead it together very briefly. Wrap tightly in
  plastic and chill for at least 4 hours. During this time, the enzymes
  in the flour will mellow the gluten to permit the water to be
  absorbed completely; this conditioning will help to prevent shrinkage
  and toughness later. Makes enough for two 9-inch pie shells.

  From: Brett Jones
  
  In the last 17 years, I've worked for a LOT of restaurants
  :)  My favorite trick was from Chi-Chi's [ha! I NEVER signed that
  non-disclosure agreement] .... the absolute best marinade for chicken
  (we used it for our fajitas) is margarita mix. Yes, just go out and
  find your favorite margarita mix (Mr & Mrs T's is good) or a little
  sweet & sour, put the chicken breasts in a shallow pan and cover with
  the mix. Marinate at least overnight, preferably for 24 hours. NUMM!

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  1 1/2 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water (105-115 deg)
      1 tb Sugar
  3 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Warm water

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      1 cn Tomatoes; 6-1 brand or plum
           -tomatoes
      1 ts Basil
      1 ts Oregano
           Salt
     10 oz Mozzarella cheese; sliced
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
    1/2 lb Italian sausage; casing rem
           Olive oil
           Garlic
 
  DOUGH: Dissolve yeast in the 1/2 c. warm water. Add the sugar and stir
  well.  Set aside.  In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 c. of flour,
  salt and cornmeal. Make a well in the center of the flour. Add the
  yeast mixture, the vegetable oil, and the 1/2 c. of water. Stir and
  mix thoroughly until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and a
  rough mass is formed. Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a
  well-floured work surface. Knead and pound the dough (dust with flour
  if dough sticks to hands) for 5-6 minutes, until it is smooth and
  soft. Dust the dough and a large mixing bowl lightly with flour.
  Place the dough in the bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
  a kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
  about 1 1/2 hrs. After the dough has doubled, turn it out of the bowl
  and knead for about 2 minutes. Oil the bottom and sides of the pizza
  pan. Spread the dough in the pan with your fingers and palm. (It will
  spread more easily if you let it sit in the pan for about 10 min.)
  Work the dough until it covers the bottom of the pan. Pull the edges
  of the dough up to form a lip or a pronounced border around the pan.
  Preheat the oven to 475 deg.  Prick the dough bottom with a fork at
  1/2-inch intervals. Let rise for 30 min. Parbake for exactly 4 min.
  Brush the crust with olive oil or butter. TOPPING:  In a bowl,
  combine the tomatoes, basil, oregano and salt. ASSEMBLY: Lay the
  slices of mozzarella cheese evenly over the crust. Spoon the tomatoes
  over the cheese. Sprinkly the grated Parmesan cheese over the
  tomatoes. Add Italian sausage. Drizzle about 1 T. olive oil on top.
  Bake the pizza in a preheated 500 deg. oven on the bottom oven rack
  for 5 minutes;  move the pizza to an oven rack 2 levels above the
  lower rack and bake an additional 15 minutes, until crust is lightly
  browned and sausage is cooked through.  Caroline McCall

      1 ea Crust
      1 c  Warm water (110-115 deg)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  3 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Coarse ground cornmeal
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 ea Filling
      1 lb Mozzarella, sliced
      1 lb Sausage
     28 oz Can whole tomatoes
      2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      3 ts Dried oregano, -or-
      5 ea Basil leaves, shredded
      4 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Drain and coarsely crush the tomatoes. Remove sausage from casing and
  crumble.  Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve
  the yeast with a fork. Add 1 cup of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt,
  and, and vegetable oil.  Mix well with a spoon. Continue stirring in
  the rest of the flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes away
  from the sides of the bowl. Flour your hands and the work surface and
  kneed the ball of dough until it is no longer sticky.  Let the dough
  rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic wrap, for 45 to 60 minutes
  in a warm place, until it is doubled in bulk. Punch it down and kneed
  it briefly. Press it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish pizza pan, until
  it comes 2 inches up the sides and is even on the bottom of the pan.
  Let the dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling. Preheat the oven to
  500 degrees. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Cook the
  crumbled sausage until it is no longer pink, and drain it of it's
  excess fat. Drain and chop the tomatoes. When the dough has finished
  its second rising, lay the cheese over the dough shell. Then
  distribute the sausage and garlic over the cheese. Top with the
  tomatoes.  Sprinkle on the seasonings and Parmesan cheese. Bake for
  15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the temperature to 400 degrees
  and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a section of the crust
  from time to time with a spatula to check on its color. The crust
  will be golden brown when done.  Serve immediately.

  In a stainless-steel stockpot large enough to hold 2-1/2 gallons of
  liquid, combine the jora, chancaca or sugars, cloves, pepper, and
  crushed sugarcane with 8 quarts of cold water. Allow to soak for 1
  hour. Place over high heat and bring to boil, stirring now and then
  with a wooden spoon and scraping the bottom of the pot to prevent
  sticking and burning. When the mixture comes to a full boil, lower
  the heat and gently simmer, covered, for 4-1/2 hours, stirring now
  and then.
  
  Remove from heat and allow to rest for about 2 hours undisturbed. Pour
  through a strainer.  Press liquid from the sugar cane and discard the
  pulp. Strain the mixture again through a double layer of cheesecloth
  into a ceramic, porcelain, or glass container and store in a dark,
  cool place, covered tightly with cheesecloth or a kitchen towel.
  Allow to sit from 3 to 8 days, depending on how strong and how thick
  you want the chicha to be. The longer the chicha sits, the higher the
  alcohol content and the thicker it will get.
  
  To serve, add the additional sugar to taste, chill thoroughly, and
  garnish with lemon slices.

  1 1/2 lb Tomatillos
      4    To 5 chilies serranos (to
           -taste)
      1    Garlic clove, peeled and
           -roughly chopped
    1/4 c  Loosely packed, roughly
           -chopped cilantro

      3 tb Finely chopped white onion
           Sea salt to taste
      6 oz Chicharron, broken into
           -squares abut 1 1/2 inches
 
  Remove the husks from the tomate verde and rinse will. Put into a
  saucepan with the fresh chilies, cover with water, and bring to a
  simmer. Continue simmering until soft but not falling apart, about 10
  minutes. Drain the tomate verde and transfer with the chilies and 1/4
  cup of the cooking water to a blender.  Add the garlic and cilantro
  and blend until smooth.
  
  Heat the lard in a frying pan, add the onion, and fry gently, without
  browning, for 1 minute.  Add the blended sauce and fry over high heat,
  stirring from time to time, until reduced and thickened - about 7
  minutes. Add salt to taste and the pieces of chicharron and continue
  cooking over medium heat until the chicharron is just soft - about 5
  minutes, depending on thickness and quality.
  
  Serve with corn tortillas and a dollop of frijoles refritos.

      Title: CHICK PEAS WITH GARLIC & GREEN CHILLIES
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    To 6 cloves of garlic,
           Crushed or minced
    1/2 ts Cumin seeds
        x  Stock or sherry for
           Sauteeing
      1 tb Tomato paste, mixed with
           3 Tb water
      1    15 oz can chick peas,
           Drained
      1    Medium-large potato, peeled
           And diced
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    To 2 fresh green chillies,
           Chopped
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
        x  Few drops lemon juice
        x  Cayenne pepper, if you like
           It hot....
 
  Sautee the cumin seeds and garlic in stock or sherry for 2 mins, then
  add the diluted tomato paste and cook for 1 minute longer. Then add
  the chick peas, water, potato, salt, green chillies, ground cumin,
  and lemon juice. I find that one green chilli makes this pleasantly
  spicy, but if you like it hot, add cayenne pepper or chili powder at
  this stage. Simmer for 20 mins. Serve with bread; I like pitta bread,
  but crusty bread or tortillas work just as well.

      Title: CHICK-FIL-A CHICKEN SANDWICH
 Categories: Poultry, Sandwiches, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Peanut oil
      1    Egg
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Milk
  2 1/2 tb Powdered sugar
    1/2 ts Pepper
      2 tb Salt
      2    Skinless,boneless chicken>>>
           Breasts-halved
      4    Plain hamburger buns
      2 tb Melted butter
      8    Dill pickle chips/slices
 
  1) Heat oil  in a pressure cooker over med. heat to about 400 F. 2) In
  small bowl, beat egg and stir in milk. 3) In separate bowl, combine
  dry ingreds.-mix well. 4) Dip each piece of chicken in milk until it
  is fully moistened. 5) Roll moistened chicken in flour mixture untill
  completely coated. 6) Drop all 4 chicken pcs. into hot oil and close
  pressure cooker. When steam starts shooting through the pressure
  release, set timer for 3 1/2 min. 7) While chicken is cooking, spread
  a coating of melted butter on face of each bun. 8) When chicken is
  done, remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Place two pickles on
  each bottom bun; add a chicken breast, then the top bun.
  
  Yield: 4 sandwiches
  
  It is very important that oil be hot for this recipe. Test the
  temperature by dropping some of the flour coating into the oil. If it
  bubbles rapidly, your oil is probably hot enough. It should take abt.
  20 min. to heat up.
  
  To make a "deluxe" chicken sandwich, simply add two tomato slices and
  a leaf of lettuce. Mayonaise also goes well on this sandwich--it is a
  side order at the restaurant.

      Title: CHICKEN & ANDOUILLE GUMBO
 Categories: Cajun, Soups/stews
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      1 c  Oil
  1 1/2 lb Andouille sausage; or kielb
  3 3/4 c  Onions; chopped
      2 c  Green pepper; chopped
  8 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      1 x  Cayenne pepper
      1 x  File
      1 x  Cooked rice
      1 ea Chicken; cut up or boned
      1 c  Flour
      2 c  Celery; chopped
      3 ts Garlic; chopped
      1 x  Salt
      2 c  Green onion; chopped
      1 x  Cream sherry
 
  Season and brown chicken in oil (lard, bacon drippings) over med-hi
  heat. Add sausage (cut in 1/4" rounds) to pot and saute with chicken.
  Remove both from pot. Make roux with equal parts of oil and flour to
  desired color (I make a dark chestnut color). Add onions, celery,
  green pepper, and later garlic to roux, stir continuously until
  vegetables reach desired tenderness. Return chicken and sausage to
  pot and cook with vegetables, continuing to stir frequently.
  Gradually stir in liquid and bring to boil. Reduce to simmer and cook
  for an hour or more. Season to taste. Approximately 10 minutes before
  serving, add green onions. Gumbo may or may not be served over rice.
  Adding sherry at the table is also an option. File may be placed on
  the table for individuals to add to their gumbo if they wish.  1/4 to
  1/2 tsp per serving is recommended. File - a fine green powder that
  is young dried and ground sassafras leaves, used in gumbo for flavor
  and thickening.  The word file means to twist or make threads. If you
  put the file directly into the gumbo while it is cooking, that is
  what you will end up with, a liquid that is rather stringy as you
  bring your spoon out of the bowl. Ugh!  Do it right, let each person
  add their own at the table. If making roux over very high heat, the
  oil you use must be free of food particles to avoid burning. If you
  scorch your roux, even slightly, while you are making it, throw it
  out, and start over again after you have thoroughly cleaned the pot.
  When making an okra gumbo, add 4-6 cups of cut okra to trinity,
  saute, and cook together with roux. (remember, the Cajun cooking
  trinity is onions, celery and green pepper).

      Title: CHICKEN & ANDOUILLE SMOKED SAUSAGE GUMBO
 Categories: Cajun, Chicken, Sausage, Gumbo
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken, cut up
           Salt
           Garlic powder
           Ground red pepper (cayenne)
      1 c  Onions, finely chopped
      1 c  Green bell peppers, finechop
    3/4 c  Celery, finely chopped
  1 1/4 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Ground Red pepper (cayenne)
           Vegetable oil for deep fry
      7 c  Chicken stock, more or less
    1/2 lb Andouille smoked sausage-OR
           - other good smoked pork
           - sausage, e.g. Kielbasa.
           - cut into 1/4 inch cubes.
      1 ts Minced garlic
           Serve over hot rice
 
  Remove excess fat from the chicken pieces.  Rub a generous amount of
  salt, garlic powder and red pepper on both sides of each piece,
  making sure each is evenly covered. Let stand at room temperature for
  30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, in a medium size bowl combine the onions, bell peppers and
  celery; set aside.
  
  Combine the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and
  1/2 teaspoon red pepper in a paper or plastic bag. Add the chicken
  pieces and shake until chicken is well coated. Reserve 1/2 cup of the
  flour.
  
  In a large heavy skillet heat 1 1/2 inches of oil until very hot (375
  to 400 degree).  Fry the chicken until crust is brown on both sides
  and meat is cooked, about 5 to 8 minutes per side; drain on paper
  towels. Carefully pour the hot oil into a glass measuring cup,
  leaving as many of the browned particles in the pan as possible.
  Scrape the pan bottom with a metal whisk to loosen any stuck
  particles, then return 1/2 cup of the hot oil to the pan.
  
  Place pan over high heat.  Using a long handled metal whisk,
  gradually stir in the reserved 1/2 cup flour. Cook, whisking
  constantly, until roux is dark red brown to black, about 3 1/2 to 4
  minutes, being careful not to let it scorch or splash on your skin.
  Remove from heat and immediately add the reserved vegetable mixture,
  stirring constantly until the roux stops getting darker.  Return pan
  to low heat and cook until vegetabvles are soft, about 5 minutes,
  stirring constantly and scraping the pan bottom well.
  
  Meanwhile, place the stock in a 5 1/2 quart saucepan or large Dutch
  oven. Bring to a boil.  Add roux mixture by spoonfuls to the boiling
  stock, stirring until dissolved between each addition. Return to a
  boil, stirring and scraping pan bottom often.  Reduce heat to a
  simmer and stir in the andouille and minced garlic. Simmer uncovered
  for about 45 minutes, stirring often towards the end of cooking time.
  
  While the gumbo is simmering, bone the cooked chicken and cut the
  meat into 1/2 inch dice.  When the gumbo is cooked, stir in the
  chicken and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
  
  To serve as a main course, mound 1/3 cup cooked rice in the center of
  a soup bowl; ladle about 1 1/4 cups gumbo around the rice. For an
  appetizer, place 1 heaping teaspoon cooked rice in a cup and ladle
  3/4 cup gumbo on top.

  the mozzerella at one end of each breast. Lay one (or two if they'll
  fit side by side) asparagus length on top, cross-wise Roll the breast
  up and secure with toothpicks...you should have a bundle of chicken
  rolled cylindrically around the spear (e.g. like paper towels on a

  together. (If you get it too wet, add more processed beans. Add the
  chopped red onion, the jalepeno pepper, the chopped cilantro and mix.
  
  Take a large flour tortilla and spread with a little bit of the fat
  free sour cream and some grated cheese. Add a couple of tablespoons
  of the filling on one end and fold the sides over and then roll up.
  You can use a toothpick to keep it rolled up or place it end side
  down to keep it from unrolling.
  
  Either bake in a hot (450-degree) oven until brown and crunchy or
  microwave until hot. Serve toped with lettuce, tomatoes, red onion,
  fatfree sour cream, grated cheese, salsa and jalepenos.

 Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Appetizers
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
           Filling:
      1 lb Ground chicken
    1/2 c  Finely chopped Chinese
           -garlic chives
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Freshly grated ginger
    1/2 ts MSG (opt)
      1 pn Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground white pepper
           Assembly:
           Additional whole chives
     24    Shu-mei wrappers (Gyoza
           -skins)
 
  Mix all filling ingredients together.  Whip by hand until the mixture
  holds together very well.  Place about 3/4 T filling in the center of
  each wrapper and bring up the corners so that you have a little
  "money bag." Leave the top open so that you can see some of the meat.
  Blanch the whole chives in very hot tap water just for a moment. Tie
  one chive around the neck of each dumpling so that it looks like it
  is wearing a little green belt.  Steam in an oiled bamboo steamer for
  15 minutes, on high heat. From The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient

      Title: CHICKEN & COCONUT MILK SOUP (GAENG COM YAM
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 c  "Thin" coconut milk
      1 sm Chicken, sectioned and cut
           -into bite-sized pieces
           -(bone-in)
      3    Stalks lemon grass, bruised
           -and cut into 1" lengths
      2 ts Laos powder (Ka)
      3    Green onions, finely chopped
      2 tb Coriander leaves, chipped
      4    To 6 fresh Serrano
           -chillies, seeded and
           -chopped
           Juice of 2 limes
      3 tb Fish sauce (Nam Pla)
 
  Here's another classic "Tom Yam" type chicken soup. The "Laos" powder
  is dried galangal, powdered.  Unlike ginger, dried galangal seems to
  retain most of it's character. If you use canned coconut milk, the
  "Thin" milk is the more watery liquid in the can.  The thick
  condensed stuff is coconut "cream" (not to be confused with the
  syrupy sweet coconut cream used for Pina Coladas). If you shake the
  can up and combine the two, you have thick coconut milk.
  
  A lovely lemony, creamy soup, Dom Yam Gai calls for chicken pieces cut
  through the bone with a heavy cleaver, Chinese style. If you find
  gnawing on chicken pieces and delicately trying to remove the bone,
  vainly searching for a place to deposit it, inhibiting your dinner
  conversation, you may debone the bird and substitute chicken pieces.
  In either case, use both dark and light meats for color and nutrition.
  
  [Although if you're talking at the table, ya got no reason to be
  eating a dish this good!  S.C.  ;-} ]
  
  In a saucepan, bring the "Thin" coconut milk to a boil. Add the
  chicken pieces, lemon grass and Laos powder. Reduce heat and simmer
  until the chicken is tender, about 15 minutes. Do not cover as this
  will tend to curdle coconut milk.  When the chicken is tender, add
  the green onions, coriander leaves and chillies. Bring the heat up
  just below boiling. Remove the pan from heat, stir in lime juice,
  fish sauce and serve.
  
  NOTE:  Beef cut into thin strips or firm white fish pieces may be
  substituted for chicken.

  the cooking liquid and 1 cup of the vegetables. When the chicken has
  cooled, skin and debone the chicken. Set the chicken meat aside. In a
  mixing bowl, beat the egg and 1 cup of the milk together. Season the
  mixture with salt and white pepper. Stir in the baking powder and
  parsley. Stir in the flour, mixing to make a thick paste. Fold in 1
  cup of the reserved vegetables. If any fat has risen to top of the
  broth, skim the fat off and discard. Return the chicken broth and
  chicken meat to the stock pot. Bring the liquid to a boil. In a small
  bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining milk. Whisk the
  cornstarch mixture into chicken broth. Bring the liquid back to a
  boil and reduce to a simmer. Drop heaping tablespoons of the dumpling
  batter into the hot mixture, distributing the dumplings evenly, until
  all the batter is used. When the dumplings have risen to the surface,
  simmer and cook for 4 minutes, stirring gently. Serve the chicken and
  dumplings immediately in soup bowls.

MMMMM-----------------PREVIOUSLY PREPARED BROTH----------------------
  2 1/2 qt Double Chicken Broth Stock
           -(See separate recipe)

MMMMM--------------------DUMPLING INGREDIENTS-------------------------
      2 c  Flour; All-purpose; sifted
      3 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
      2 md Eggs
    2/3 c  Milk
 
  Follow the recipe for poached chicken in Double Chicken Broth.
  :
       See: Double Chicken Broth Stock recipe. In this recipe you leave
  the chicken in the pot and add the dumplings, as described below,
  then serve the chicken and dumplings. * Directions for Dumplings *
  While the chicken is cooking in the other recipe, make up the
  dumplings, which will be added for the last 15 minutes of cooking
  time. Sift the dry ingredients together. Beat the eggs and milk
  together lightly and blend with the flour mixture to make a fairly
  stiff dough. Form very small dumplings by taking a tablespoon full of
  dough and rolling it into a ball shape. You may use the palm of your
  hand to do this. About 15 minutes before the end of the cooking time,
  remove the lid from the pot in which the chicken is cooking and drop
  the rounded tablespoons of the dumpling dough over the surface of the
  liquid, spacing them a few inches apart as the dumplings puff up.
  Cover the pan, keeping the liquid at a simmer, and cook the dumplings
  for 15 minutes, until light and cooked through. Do not remove lid
  while dumplings are cooking. Serve with the poached chicken.

           (I used 4 thighs for just
           -us)
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Shortening
    1/2    To 1 cup COLD water
      2 c  Chicken broth
      2 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Butter
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  These are my directions on how to put together: Boil chicken in
  seasoned water, I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, some liquid
  smoke..just a dribble, and salt and pepper and boiled the chicken
  till tender...about an hour. Scoop chicken out and drain, then take
  and discard skin...put in freezer to cool while you make dumplins. To
  the chicken water, pour in one can or so of evaporated milk...skip
  the butter, enough fat from the chicken...let simmer while you make
  the dough. put flour and shortening with a dash of baking powder in
  large bowl and cut together till crumbly. I used my large whisk since
  I've lost my pastry cutter many moons ago...then add just enough cold
  water as you need it for a nice soft, non sticky dough. Roll out on
  floured surface and roll into thin sheet(s). Cut with sharp knife
  into squares. Get your soup boiling and drop the squares in one at a
  time...DON'T STIR after adding dumplins..just press. em down a little
  and keep adding em in. Let slow boil for about 20 mins.. add the
  chicken that you've chopped while the dumplins was cooking...and
  EAT!!! Hubby doesn't like garlic, but he sure scarfed these down in
  no time!!! You can add veggies now and then..my daughter always liked
  this recipe with chopped broccoli..go figure!

    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Dried oregano leaves
    1/8 ts Pepper
      1    Garlic clove, minced
      2 oz Guava paste*
      4    Thin slices cooked ham
    1/4 c  Fresh cilantro, finely

    1/4 c  Dry sherry

    1/2 ts Beef-flavor instant
           -bouillon
 
  *Guava paste is available in Mexican & Spanish groceries. If you
  cannot find it, you can substitute the same amount of jellied
  cranberry sauce. Place one chicken breast half between 2 pieces of
  plastic wrap or waxed paper.  Working from center, gently pound
  chicken with rolling pin or flat side of meat mallet until about 1/4"
  thick. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts. In small bowl, combine
  salt, oregano, pepper and garlic; mix well. Sprinkle evenly over
  chicken breasts. Form guava paste into four 2 x 1/2 x 1/2" strips and
  place one on each ham slice. Spoon about a tablespoonful of cilantro
  over each strip of guava paste. Fold ham around guava and cilantro to
  form a foll. Place one roll on narrow end of each chicken half; roll
  up, jelly-roll fashion. Secure with toothpicks. Heat 1 T oil in
  skillet over medium heat; add chicken rolls, seam side down. Cook
  covered for 6 minutes or until no longer pink, turning once halfway
  through cooking. Remove toothpicks.  Place chicken on paper towels;
  pat dry. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Separate dough into 4 rectangles;
  firmly press perforations to seal.  Place one chicken roll on each
  rectangle. Fold dough over chicken; press edges to seal. Place, seam
  side down, on ungreased cookie sheet. Cut slits in tops to allow
  steam to escape. Bake for 13 to 18 minutes or until golden brown.
  Meanwhile, in small saucepan over low heat, combine all sauce
  ingredients; cook and stir until guava paste melts. Simmer until
  sauce thickens. Place chicken bundles on serving plates; top with
  sauce. Garnish with additional cilantro, if desired.  Serve
  immediately. (2/3 cup sauce)

           -chicken, cut in pieces
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper to taste
    1/2 c  Flour plus 6 tablespoons
           -flour
  1 1/2 c  (about 2 bunches) finely
           -chopped green onions,
           -green and
           White parts

    1/4 c  Finely chopped parsley
      3 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      9 c  Chicken stock
           Cayenne pepper and/or
           -Tabasco sauce to taste
      2 ea To 6 teaspoons file powder,

      4 c  Hot, freshly cooked rice
           Finely chopped green onions
           -for garnish
 
  Cook the sausage in a large, heavy ungreased skillet over low heat,
  turning the slices frequently with a spatula until there is a film of
  fat over the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat to medium and,
  turning the slices occasionally, continue to fry the sausage until
  the slices are browned, about 6 minutes. Remove the sausage to paper
  towels to drain. Add vegetable oil to the fat in the skillet to a
  depth of 1/2 inch. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.
  Place 1/2 cup of the flour on a plate. Dredge the chicken pieces in
  the flour and shake of the excess. Heat the oil in the skillet over
  medium-high heat. fry the chicken pieces in the hot fat until they
  are golden brown on both sides and the eat is cooked through, about
  12 to 15 minutes per side.  Remove the chicken from the skillet and
  drain on paper towels.  Reserve 6 tablespoons of fat from the skillet
  an discard the rest. Whisk the reserved 6 tablespoons fat with the
  remaining 6 tablespoons of flour in a large, heavy pot until smooth.
  Cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat until the fat-flour
  mixture (called a roux) is nut brown.  This will take several
  minutes.  Do not allow the roux to burn. Add the green onions,
  celery, green pepper, parsley and garlic to the roux. Cook the
  mixture, stirring over medium-low heat until the vegetables have
  softened.  Then, stirring constantly, slowly add the chicken stock.
  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat. Add the sausage to
  the gumbo. Season to taste with salt, pepper, cayenne and/or Tabasco
  sauce. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  While gumbo is simmering, bone the cooked chicken and, using your
  fingers, shred the meat into pieces.  Add to the gumbo and simmer for
  15 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. NOTE: The gumbo tastes best
  if prepared a day or two in advance and refrigerated. Let the gumbo
  cool completely at room temperature, uncovered, before refrigerating.
  Reheat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Just before
  serving, remove the gumbo from the heat. Taste for seasoning++it
  should be spicy. Stir in the file powder to taste. (Note: File powder
  turns stringy as it cooks, so it should not be added to the gumbo
  until the pot has been removed from the heat.) Transfer the gumbo to
  a heated tureen and serve it immediately, accompanied by a bowl of
  rice. To serve, place about 1/2 cup rice to one side of a heated soup
  plate.. Ladle the gumbo around the rice and garnish each serving with
  a sprinkle of finely chopped green onions. Serves 8.

      Title: CHICKEN & NOODLE SOUP WITH VEGETABLES
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      1    5-6 lb chicken OR
      1 lb Chicken gizzards
      2 lb Chicken backs and
      1 lb Legs and thighs
      3 qt Water
      1    Onion stuck with 2 cloves
      1    Leek
      1    Carrot
           ;salt
     10    Peppercorns
    1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Carrots; finely diced
    1/2 c  Green beans; finely cut
      4 oz Egg noodles
      1 c  Frozen or fresh peas
           Parsley; chopped
 
  Place the whole chicken or the chicken pieces in a heavy 6-quart
  kettle with the water, onion stuck with cloves, leek, carrot, 1
  tablespoon salt, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil and skim off any
  scum that forms on top. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours.
  Correct the seasoning. If you are using chicken parts, cook until
  they are tender 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the chicken, skim excess
  fat from the broth, and then remove the vegetables.  (If you are not
  serving the soup till the next day, it will be easier to remove the
  fat if the broth is cooled and then chilled.) Pour the broth into a
  container, wash out the kettle, and then return the broth to it.  Add
  the cut vegetables, the meat from the legs and thighs cut into small
  dice, and the gizzards thinly sliced. Bring to a boil again and cook
  just until the vegetables begin to tenderize and are pleasantly firm.
  Add the noodles (increase the amount if you like a very thick soup)
  and peas, and boil for 5 to 9 minutes or until they are cooked. Serve
  in heated soup plates or bowls and sprinkle with some chopped parsley.
  
  This deliciously filling soup is ideal for a Sunday supper,
  accompanied by buttered toast or hot rolls, perhaps followed by a
  salad or some excellent cheese and a bottle of red wine.
  
  Note:  Other vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, and zucchini, as
  well as mushrooms, may be added to the soup during the final cooking.

 Categories: Chicken, Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Basic Crocked Chicken, incl
           Broth (see Basic Crocked
           Chicken recipe)
     10    Baby carrots, cut into
           Lengthwise slender strips
      1 pk (10 oz) frozen peas
      1 tb Thyme leaves
     12 oz Dry egg noodles
      6    Green onions, sliced, incl
           Some dark green stalks
      2 tb Minced fresh parsley
           Generous amount, ground
           Black pepper
           Salt to taste

           Parmesan cheese
           Optional garnish: sprigs of
           Fresh Italian parsley
 
  Cook's Note:  If you like, you can add other cooked vegetables to this
  dish.  Blanched sugar snap peas, sauteed mushrooms, or cubes of cooked
  butternut squash are delicious.
  
  1. Remove chicken from crockpot with a large slotted spatula or
  slotted spoon.  Strain liquid; if time permits, place strained broth
  in refrigerator; when fat congeals, remove the fat, discard, and save
  the broth.  If making Chicken and Noodles immediately, place strained
  broth in fat separator (this is a container that collects the fat and
  pours out the lean juices through a spout that's connected at the
  bottom); discard fat left in separator.
  
  2. Place juices in saucepan and reduce by one third.  Add carrots and
  cook on high heat until carrots are cooked tender-crisp, about 1
  minute. Remove from heat and add peas and thyme; set aside.
  
  3. Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions until
  cooked al dente.  Drain.  Combine noodles and chicken broth mixture.
  Remove chicken from bones and skin, tearing into bite-size pieces;
  add to noodles. Add green onions and parsley.  Season with freshly
  ground black pepper and salt to taste.
  
  Presentation: If desired, top individual servings with a small amount
  of Parmesan grated cheese and garnish with sprigs of fresh Italian
  parsley.

      Title: CHICKEN & RED BELL PEPPER BOLOGNESE
 Categories: Pasta, Low-fat, Sauces, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, chopped fine
      1 md Garlic clove, chopped fine
    1/2 lb Ground chicken breast
    1/2 c  Chardonnay or other dry
           - white wine
      1 cn Salt-free whole tomatoes
           - (16-ounce)
      1 tb Double-concentrate tomato
           - paste
      1 tb Fresh basil leaves, finely
           - shredded
      1 tb Fresh Italian parsley,
           - finely chopped
      2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Fresh rosemary leaves,
           - finely chopped
      2 md Red bell peppers, roasted,
           -peeled, stemmed, seeded,
           -and coarsely chopped,
           -juices saved
           Cooked pasta of your choice
 
  In a large saucepan or skillet, heat the olive oil with the onion and
  garlic over moderate heat. When they sizzle, add the chicken and
  saute it, stirring and breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon,
  until it begins to brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
  
  Add the wine and stir and scrape well to deglaze the pan. Add the
  tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands, and stir in the remaining
  ingredients.
  
  Simmer the sauce until thick but still slightly liquid, 20 to 25
  minutes. Spoon over cooked pasta -- spaghetti, fettuccine or
  medium-sized tubles, shells or other shapes are recommended.
  
  Directions for roasting bell peppers:
  ~------------------------------------ Place the peppers in a
  foil-lined baking sheet in a 500 degree oven. Roast until their skins
  are evenly blistered and browned, about 25 minutes, turning them 2 or
  3 times so they roast evenly. Remove them from the oven and cover
  them with a kitchen towel.
  
  When the peppers are cool enough to handle, pull out their stems,
  peel away their blackened skins; open the peppers up; and remove
  their seeds, using a teaspoon to pick up any stray ones.
  
  Take care not to lose any of the peppers' juices, which are also very
  flavorful. You might want to pour them through a fine mesh strainer to
  remove any seeds or bits of skin.

  Rinse with cold water until water runs clear. Drain thoroughly. Put
  rice and water into a 2 1/2 to 3-quart sandy clay pot; set aside.
  
  In 2 separate bowls, cover the mushrooms and lily buds with water
  until soft and pliable, about 30 minutes. Drain. Cut off and discard

      Title: CHICKEN & RICE WITH CHIPOTLE
 Categories: Chile-heads, Chicken
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 c  Rice (I normally use Uncle
           B's long grain)
  2 1/2 c  Water
      2    Chicken breasts -- boned and
           Trimmed,
           Or equivalent
      2 tb Oil for frying
      2    Dry chipotle peppers (at the
           Least - you
           May want more)
    1/2    Green bell pepper
    1/2    Red bell pepper
    1/2 md Onion
      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2 ts Cumin -- pref. whole seed
           Coarsely ground
    1/8 ts Tumeric for color
           Bouqet of herbs such as
           Oregano or
           Whatever is available -
           Experiment!
           Salt to taste
 
  First, do the prep work:  Cut onion and bell peppers into
  fingertip-size pieces.  Tear chipotle peppers into thumbnail-size
  pieces (if you are serving non- chile heads, tear the chipotle into
  bigger pieces, so they can fish it out and put it on your plate).
  Cut the chicken into big nuggets. Mince the garlic.  Crush the cumin.
  Cook the rice with the water, according to package directions. I
  recommend that you avoid the more convenient varieties, which come
  out looking like chromosones. I like the usual long-grain, but you
  could also use a package of "wild" rice or some kind of mix of
  whatever you like.   Add the tumeric and chipotle pepper, and stir
  occasionally. When rice is nearly done, quickly fry the chicken, bell
  peppers, garlic and onion. The chicken should be cooked through, and
  it's also nice to brown it a bit. Combine all ingredients in the rice
  pot for the last moments of rice cooking. Add the herbs and stir. If
  necessary, you can hold the finished mix in the pot for some time ~
  it's handy when you have to round everybody up to the table. Eat, get
  on a horse, and ride into the sunset. (Well, that last part worked
  for me in southern Wisconsin in '94.) Alex Silbajoris

      3 qt Water
 
   Cut up chicken, remove skin if ya like. Dredge the chicken with
  flour salt and pepper. Fry the chicken until brown. Slice up a pound
  of the link sausage... for a hotter sausage, try the Louisiana
  'Andouie', if available. After the chicken is browned, place sausage
  in the same skilett... use a heavy iron one. Brown the sausage, on
  both sides. Save the grease from chicken and sausage.
   Fry the tomatoe, onion and okra in about 2 T shortening or oil,
  until they become tender.
   Make a roux with 2 ts oil and 2 ts flour, stir and brown over a
  medium-low heat until the roux is as dark as possible without burning
  it. Do not burn the roux... just make it real dark.
   Place chicken and sausage in the roux, stir a bit. Then place all
  ingredients into a heavy, deep iron pan, add water and cook about 2
  hours. Cook slow, add water if needed. The okra will thicken the
  gumbo as it cooks. 

 Categories: Soups, Chicken, Pork, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 qt Chicken stock
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Butter
      2 md Onions, diced
      2    Ribs celery, diced
      1 md Carrot, scrubbed and diced
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 tb Brandy
      1 lg Turnip, peeled and diced
    1/4 lg Butternut squash, peeled,
           -seeded and diced
      1    Thick slice crusty French or
           -Otalian bread
      3 sm Cloves garlic
      1    Egg
     12 oz Boned and skin cooked
           -chicken, coarsely diced
      4 oz Best quality smoked ham,
           -coarsely diced
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Small sprigs fresh basil
           -and/or parsley
           Unbleached all-purpose flour
           Salt to taste
 
  Bring the stock to a boil in a large soup pot.  Turn the heat down to
  low and let simmer, uncovered, while you continue.
  
  Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions
  and saute for 2 or 3 minutes.  Add the celery and carrot; saute for
  another 5 minutes, then add the vegetables to the simmering chicken
  stock along with the tomato paste, brandy, turnip and butternut
  squash. Simmer gently, covered, until the vegetables are tender,
  about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, make the meatballs.  In a food processor whizz together the
  bread, garlic and egg for about 30 seconds until a smooth paste is
  formed. Add the chicken, ham, pepper and the basil and/or parsley.
  Pulse-chop 10 to 15 times, then process until a smooth, very thick
  paste is formed.
  
  Roll the meat paste into balls the size of a large marble. Roll the
  balls in the flour so that they are lightly dusted all over.
  
  When the vegetables are tender, raise the heat slightly so that the
  soup simmers with a little more intensity. Drop the meatballs into
  the soup and let cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Taste for seasoning and
  adjust if necessary. Be careful not to oversalt as the ham is salty.
  Serve immediately.
  
  Serves 6 to 8 as an entre with bread and salad.
  
  NOTE:  This is even better the next day, but first remove the
  meatballs and wrap them separately rather than storing them overnight
  with the broth.

      Title: CHICKEN & VEGETABLE TERRINE
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
      1/2 lb carrots, -- peeled
      3/4 lb haricots verts, parboiled
  :          for 5 minutes
    1 1/4 lb ground chicken
      1/2 c  vegetable oil
      1/4 c  finely chopped shallots
        1    clove garlic cooked until
  :          tender in
        2 TB butter
        1 lg clove garlic, -- minced
      1/4 c  Champagne or white wine
  :          vinegar
        1    egg lightly beaten
      1/4 c  soft white bread crumbs
      1/2 c  pitted black Nicoise olives
  :          Salt and freshly ground
  :          black pepper
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease an 8 x 4 inch
  glass loaf pan. Cut the carrots into strips the length of the carrots
  but only 1/4 wide (should be evenly cut 1/4inch square). Parboil for
  6 to 7 minutes or until cooked through but still with some texture to
  them. Puree ground chicken a little bit at a time in a food processor
  with the oil and vinegar and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon
  pepper. Add cooked shallots, garlic, bread crumbs and egg and puree
  until very smooth.
  
  Divide chicken puree into 3 bowls. In one add the carrots; in the
  other the green beans and leave the puree plain in the third. Using
  your hands mix the vegetables into the chicken mixture in each bowl
  making sure they are completely coated. Set a tiny bit of plain
  chicken puree in bottom of loaf pan, spreading it with a rubber
  spatula to cover entire bottom surface. Then cover with a layer of
  carrot, keeping carrots in as straight a line as possible. Next layer
  green bean mixture over carrots. With a spatula layer some plain
  chicken binder on top of green beans just enough to barely coat them.
  Then set a row of black olives down the center. Dot olives with a
  paper thin layer of plain chicken binder. Then repeat green bean
  layer, then top with the carrot layer and finally a layer of chicken
  binder which should entirely cover vegetables. Cover the top with
  buttered brown paper pressing paper directly on top of terrine. Cover
  top with foil.
  
  Tap the loaf pan on the counter a few times to eliminate air bubbles.
  Place terrine in a larger pan filled with enough boiling water to
  reach 3/4 of the way up the sides of the loaf pan. Set in oven and
  bake for 1 hour.
  
  Remove the pan from the oven. Let terrine rest for another hour or
  until it is cooler. Leave the foil cover on. Drain off excess water.
  Run a sharp knife between the terrine and the pan to loosen then
  carefully turn it upside down on a board. Terrine should come out
  easily. Pat dry with paper towels. Wrap in plastic wrap, then in foil
  and let it cool in fridge for 3 hours or overnight. Yield: 6 to 8
  servings

  mushrooms and sprinkle the dry spaghetti sauce mix evenly over the
  top of the chicken. Then pour wine over the top of chicken>> wetting
  down the dry sauce mix. Add wine until you can just see it coming up
  around the chicken pieces (about 1 1/2 - 2 cups in a 10" x 10" baking
  pan). Loosely cover with foil (you want some steam to escape) and
  bake in a 350 oven for about 45 min or until chicken is done. This is
  a real simple, quick dish to fix. The sauce and wine make a kind of
  gravy so I usually serve it with buttered noodles.
