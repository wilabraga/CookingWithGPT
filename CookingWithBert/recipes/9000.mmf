      Title: BRISKET WITH SWEET POTATOES
 Categories: Beef, Main course, Pressure co
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Oil or chicken fat
  3 1/2 lb Boneless beef brisket
      2    Stalks celery -- finely
           Chopped
      2 lg Carrots -- finely chopped
      1 lg Onion -- finely chopped
      2 c  Beef stock or boullion
      1 c  Water
  1 1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/8 ts Allspice
    1/2 c  Apple cider (up to 1 cup)
      2 lb Sweet potatoes, peeled --
           Cut in 1/2" slices
  1 1/2 lb Parsnips, peeled -- cut in
      1    " chunks
      1 c  Pitted prunes -- coarsely
           Chopped
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in the cooker.  Over high heat, brown the meat
  well on both sides, lifting it up frequently with tongs or spatula to
  prevent sticking. Add additional fat if needed. Set aside. (Don't be
  concerned if the brisket has to be squeezed against the sides of the
  pot; it will shrink considerably during cooking.) In the oil
  remaining in the cooker, saute the celery, carrot, and onion for 3
  minutes, stirring occasionally and taking care to scrape up any
  browned bits of meat or vegetable sticking to the bottom of the pot.
  Add the beef stock, water, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.  Submerge
  the rack into this mixture, and place the meat on it with the fat
  side facing up. Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to
  high pressure.  Adjust the heat to maintain high pressure and cook
  for 55 minutes.  Let the pressure drop naturally, about 10 - 15
  minutes. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess
  steam to escape. If the brisket is done, you should easily be able to
  pry a small chunk of meat from one end with a fork.  If it is not
  sufficiently tender, lock the lid back into place and return to high
  pressure for another 10 - 15 minutes. If time permits cool to room
  temperature and refrigerate brisket and gravy overnight.  Remove any
  congealed fat and return the gravy to the cooker. About 20 minutes
  before serving, stir in enough cider to equal approximately 2 cups.
  Add the sweet potatoes, parsnips, and prunes. Lock the lid in place
  and over high heat bring to high pressure, adjust heat and cook for 3
  minutes. Quick release the pressure. Add salt and pepper. Cut the
  brisket into slices on the diagonal, place in the cooker, and spoon
  gravy and vegetables on top. Cover but do not lock. Cook over medium
  heat just until the meat is warmed throughout. Arrange on a platter
  and surround with the vegetables. Pour gravy on top.

      Title: BROCCOLI "PESTO"
 Categories: Pasta, Sauces and, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Broccoli Florets
    1/4 c  To 1/2 Cup Olive Oil
    1/4 c  Parmesan Cheese
      8    Sundried Tomatoes -- * see
           Note
      1    Handful Unsalted Cashews
      1 sm Bulb Garlic
 
  * plus about 2T of Trader Joe Sundried Tomato Seasoning (dried tomato
  and spices)
  
  Steam broccoli and allow to cool.  In blender or food processor,
  puree cool broccoli, olive oil, garlic, and cashews. Add oil as
  necessary. Remove to bowl, and stir in parmesan cheese and chopped
  sundried tomato. Serve over hot pasta.  (I served Sundried
  Tomato/Basil Tortelloni purchased from Trader Joe)
  
  There it is...eat/try at your own risk.  I thought it was fine, but
  proportions may need to be changed to thin it down a bit next time.
  And (shudder) an entire bulb of garlic may have been too much, it was
  actually hot/spicy from the garlic.

  pieces. Place broccoli in a microwave safe container. Add about 1/4
  cup water. Cover lightly with plastic wrap. Cook in microwave on high
  for 3-5 minutes. Check for doneness. Want to keep broccoli a little
  crisp. While broccoli is cooking, cook angel hair pasta until
  slightly firm. Drain. Melt the stick of butter in the pan you cooked
  angel hair in. Add angel hair back to pan and toss to coat pasta. Add
  broccoli and toss lightly. Pour some olive oil in a small frying pan.
  Add chopped garlic and some crushed red pepper. Brown garlic. Garlic
  will clump together when done. Pour over pasta and broccoli. Sprinkle

 Categories: Ethnic:, Chinese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
      1/2 lb lean beef (preferably flank
  :          steak)
        1 TB soy sauce
        1 TB rice wine or sherry
        1 TB cornstarch
        1    green onion -- cut into 1"
  :          pieces
        1 ts fresh ginger -- chopped
  :          COOKING SAUCE:
      1/2 c  chicken broth
        2 TB soy sauce
        2 TB oyster sauce
      1/2 TB rice wine or sherry
        2 ts cornstarch
        2 ts sugar
  :          few drops sesame oil
  :       pn pepper
  :          VEGETABLES:
        2 c  broccoli flowerets
        1 c  canned mushrooms (straw or
  :          button) -- drained
        1    carrot -- sliced
  
  1.  Cut the beef across the grain into thin slices. Marinate in the
  soy sauce, rice wine, and cornstarch. Set aside. 2. Cut up the green
  onion and ginger. 3. Mix all the ingredients for the cooking sauce.
  4. Blanch the broccoli and carrot slices in boiling water with a
  pinch of salt until slightly soft, but still crunchy. Drain and set
  aside. I usually do this step in the microwave. 5. Heat a wok over
  high heat. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons oil.  Fry the green onion and
  ginger until fragrant, then add the marinaded beef.  Stir fry quickly
  until the meat changes color. 6. Pour in the cooking sauce and heat
  until thickened and bubbly. 7. Mix in the vegetables. 8. Serve over
  rice. Note: As with all Chinese cooking, it is very important to have
  a strong heat
  
  source.  Have your stove on the highest setting, or if possible, cook
  in your backyard on a propane gas stove. This takes care of the
  problem of odors and smoke in your kitchen also.

      Title: BROCCOLI BISQUE
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/4 lb Broccoli (fresh),
           -trimmed and cut up
           -(okay to use more)
      4 c  Chicken broth
           -(2 cans of canned broth,
           -or use fresh stock)
      1 md Onion
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Curry powder (or less)
      1 ds Pepper
      2 tb Lime juice
      8    Lemon slices, (optional)
    1/2 c  Sour cream
      1 tb Chives, snipped
           -(optional)
 
  Place the cut broccoli in a large saucepan along with the broth,
  onion, butter, salt, curry powder and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce
  heat and simmer, covered, for 8 to 12 minutes or until broccoli is
  just tender.
  
  Place about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the mixture at a time into a blender
  container. Cover and blend until smooth. Pour into bowl or another
  large pan.  Repeat with remaining mixture. BE CAREFUL. THE HOT LIQUID
  MAY SCALD YOU.  Stir in the lime juice.
  
  Now you can either cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours to serve
  cold (great in warm weather), or you can go right ahead and serve it
  hot (great in cold weather). Once ladled out, you can garnish with a
  thin slice of lemon, a small dollop or sour cream, and a sprinkling
  of chives.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A broccoli soup (hot or cold) -- This recipe is from my mom. It's
  been a hit every time she or I have served it. It is rather spicy -
  not for the timid or faint-of-heart.
  
  *  You can refrigerate unused portions for serving later, but it
  doesn't keep well for long. I like to blend it pretty well, so that
  the texture is quite smooth. Some people like it a little chunkier.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      1 c  Half-and-half
      2    Chicken bouillon cubes
 
  In large saucepan, cook broccoli in 1 cup water; do not drain. Put

  Add half-and-half and bouillon cubes. Cook, stirring, over medium
  heat until hot and mixture thickens.  Mixture will thicken more upon
  sitting.
  
  Makes 6 cups.
  
  NOTE:  I like to cut down a bit on the richness this soup has by
  using 2% milk; and Velveeta "Light" cheese. Keep stirring-as it may
  burn. Do not cook for more than 25 minutes as it becomes a great
  cheese sauce after a while-good for pouring over potatoes-but not
  good if you want soup.

           -JUDI M. PHELPS
  1 1/2    To 2 lb. broccoli di rabe;
           -remove 1 inch off bottom of
           -stem; on top part, wash
           -well, do not dry after
           -washing
  1 1/2 c  Water
      4    Cloves garlic; whole
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
    1/2    Crushed hot pepper; optional
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Place all ingredients into pot.  Cook on medium heat, covered. When it
  boils, lower heat to low and cook until tender, approximately 15 to 20
  minutes.  Remove and serve. Makes 4-6 servings. Source: Cookbook USA
  
  Judi's Notes:  This recipe was not tested by me, but I think to
  improve the flavor of the dish a little more (and you can experiment
  to see which way you prefer) I would heat the olive oil first and
  saute the garlic in it for a few seconds, then add the broccoli rabe
  and flavor it in the oil for a minute or two to coat.  Add the
  seasonings and lemon juice. Then add about 1 cup of water and bring
  to boil. Lower heat and continue with the rest of the recipe.  Just
  dumping all the ingredients in and boiling will cook the vegetable,
  however, I think sauteing it first will make it even more palatable.
  It is my opinion that 1 cup of water will be enough, but you can add
  the full amount called for if you think it is needed.

  the garlic and ginger for one minute. Add the broccoli stalks and fry
  for a minute and a half. Add two Tablespoons of water - be careful,
  it will spit and give off lots of steam - then add the broccoli
  florets. They will turn a wonderful bright green. Stir fry for
  another two minutes over a medium to high heat until the vegetables
  are cooked and the liquid has vanished. Remove the pan from the heat

      1    Lemon juiced
      1 ds Salt

  Steam 1-2 heads of broccoli until real soft. Meanwhile saute 1 chopped
  onion and 3-4 cloves of chopped garlic
    (more if you love garlic) in some white wine or broth. When
  everything is done, dump into blender and add 1 cup veggie broth,
  juice of 1 lemon, dash of salt, and pepper to taste (I use about    1
  tsp.) and blend until smooth and thick. Add more broth if necessary
  for processing. If you eat dairy you can also add parmeasan cheese.
  
  I know this sounds too simple but it makes a heavenly pasta sauce and
  keeps real well in the refrigerator for leftovers.

      Title: BROCCOLI/MUSHROOM CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Fresh broccoli
      8 oz Fresh mushrooms
      1 c  Butter
      1 c  Flour
      4 c  Chicken broth
      4 c  Half and half
      1 ts Salt (optional)
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 ts Tarragon leaves, crushed.
 
  This recipe was submitted to Country Woman by Lorrie Arthur and it is
  delicious.
  
  Clean and cut broccoli into 1/2 inch pieces.  Steam in 1/2 cup water
  until tender/crisp (I nuke them for 3 to 4 minutes) do not drain. Set
  aside. Clean and slice mushrooms. In a large pan over medium heat,
  melt butter; add flour to make a roux.  Cook, stirring constantly,
  for 2 to 4 minutes; do not let brown. Stir in chicken broth; bring
  just to a boil. Turn heat to low; add broccoli, mushrooms,
  half-and-half and seasonings. Heat through but do not boil.
  
  Makes 8 servings.
  
  NOTE:  This recipe works well cut in half.  Last night I made it using
  broccoli and mushrooms that had been taking up space in the reefer for
  awhile and were rubbery. Still tasted great. I usually serve with
  fresh bread (made of course in my bread machine.)

  Note:the above was copied directly from the book.  I doubled the
  recipe. I also used a fresh green chili instead of canned, which I
  don't think I can get over here. It was very tasty, but do not expect
  it to taste like avocado.  Think of it as a really good broccoli dip,
  and not necessarily as a replacement for something else. Everyone at
  my party the other night enjoyed it.

    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2    White onion
      1    Tomato; roasted
      4    Cloves garlic; whole
      1 ts Cumin seeds
      2    Bay leaves
      1 ts Freshly ground pepper
           Salt ~~
 
  Prepare the kabobs: On 8 skewers, 8 to 8-1/2 inches long, alternate
  beef, peppers, and onions.  Brush with 1/4 cup oil and season with
  pepper to taste. Refrigerate for 40 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: Fry chiles in oil for 2 minutes. Drain
  and soak in hot water for 20 minutes. Drain, reserving soaking water,
  and seed. In a blender or food processor, blend chiles with onion,
  tomato, garlic, cumin, bay leaves, and pepper.  Add a little soaking
  water, and reblend. Salt.
  
  Heat a griddle.  Brush kabobs with a little oil and butter. Grill,
  turning skewers every 3 minutes and basting with oil and butter until
  brown.
  
  To serve, place a skewer on each of 8 plates.  Serve with chile sauce
  and freshly made corn tortillas.
  
  NOTE:  From the photograph in the book, the garlic cloves look like
  elephant garlic, *large*.

      Title: BROCOLI & CHEESE OMLETS
 Categories: Brunch
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 lg Eggs
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 ts Salt
           Pepper to taste
  1 1/3 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
      2 c  Cooled, cooked broccoli
           Florets
      4 tb Margarine or olive oil
 
  1. Whisk eggs, water, salt and pepper until blended. Have your
  fillings chopped and at room temperature and your serving plates
  ready.
  
  2. For each omelet: Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet until it's good
  and hot and a drop of water flicked onto the surfaces bounces. Add 1
  tablespoon margarine and tilt pan to coat. Add 1/2 cup egg mixture.
  Work your way around the pan, drawing egg from edge to center. Repeat
  until egg stops flowing but is still moist on top (egg will cook
  thoroughly as omelet is filled and folded.
  
  3. Holding skillet handle in your left hand, pointed at your navel,
  put 1/4 the cheese and broccoli on the left half of omelet (lefties
  reverse). Fold unfilled side over filling. If omelet tears, don't
  despair!
  
  4. Holding the skillet handle in the right hand, take a plate with the
  other. Invert skillet so omelet falls upside-down onto plate. This way
  you'll have a smooth surface on top.

  I love liver. One of my favorite ways to prepare it is broiling. I
  place the liver on the broiler pan, cover it with bottled french
  dressing and broil about three minutes. Turn it over, cover with more
  dressing, and broil another three minutes.

  it, why in the world does it have to be cooked like shoe leather?

           -scallion
    1/2 c  Chicken stock and/or dry
           -white wine or French
           -vermouth
      1    Tb to 2 tb butter for
           -enrichment, optional
           * butterflied as described
           -in the preceding paragraph.
 
  This is a basic recipe that can be dressed up any way you like. This
  is one of the "Master" recipes in the book. She presents Master
  recipes for each category of food then offers variations on the
  themes.
  
  I really like this book because it offers solid basics and then gets
  whimsical.  It really lives up to its "The Way to Cook" title.
  
  Of course you can broil a half chicken or chicken in parts, but when
  you want a handsome presentation at the table, butterfly is the way
  to go.
  
  To butterfly a chicken.  First remove the backbone by cutting down
  close to it on each side with a heavy knife or sturdy shears. Spread
  the chicken skin side up on your work surface and bang the breast
  with your fist to break the collarbones and some of the ribs; this
  flattens the chicken. Cut off the little nubbins at the wing elbows,
  and fold the wings akimbo by tucking the wing ends behind the
  shoulders.  Then make a slit in the skin at either side of the breast
  tip. Push the knee of the drumstick firmly up under the armpit to
  loosen the join; then pull it down and insert the tip of the
  drumstick through the skin slit. The leg will be held in place.
  
  For 4 servings:
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:
  
  A stout knife and/or shears for preparing the chicken; a basting
  brush; a baking dish about 1 inch deep (without rack) that will just
  hold the butterflied chicken easily.
  
  Broiling - 25 to 30 minutes.  Preheat the broiler. Brush the chicken
  all over with some of the butter and oil. Arrange it skin side down
  in the baking dish, and set it so the surface of the flesh is about 5
  inches from the hot broiler element.  After 5 minutes, brush the
  flesh, which should just be starting to brown, with the butter and
  oil. Baste again in 5 minutes ++ use the juices in the pan when the
  butter mixture is gone. Broil for another 5 minutes, then sprinkle
  lightly with salt, pepper, and optional herbs. Turn the chicken skin
  side up. Broil and baste 15 minutes or so more.
  
  When is it done?  The chicken is nearly done when brown juices begin
  to appear in the pan.  It is definitely done when the drumsticks feel
  tender, and, when the thickest part is pricked with the sharp tines
  of a kitchen fork, the juices run clear yellow.  Do not overcook.
  
  SAUCE:  Remove the chicken to a hot platter; cover to keep warm the
  few minutes required for the optional sauce. Skim fat off the cooking
  juices, stir in the chopped shallot or scallion, and saute a moment
  on top of the stove.  Add the liquid and boil rapidly, scraping into
  it any coagulated cooking juices.  When reduced almost to a syrup,
  swirl in the butter. Pour the sauce over the chicken.
  
  SERVING:  To carve, cut straight down one side of the breastbone to
  separate the chicken in two lengthwise. Grab under one of the knees
  with your fork to lift it up, slit the skin front and back, and bend
  the knee back at right angles to break open the joint at the small of
  the back. Then cut through the ball joint to separate the thigh from
  the carcass. Separate drumsticks from thighs at the knee joints.
  Remove the wings along with a lengthwise strip of meat from the lower
  third of the breast, to make meaningful servings. You now have 2
  drumsticks, 2 things, 2 wings with a breast strip, and 2 breast
  sections ++ everyone has a little selection of both dark and light.
  
  Suggested accompaniment to broiled chicken.  You could serve broiled
  tomatoes, sauteed potatoes, and a green vegetable, or be more
  elaborate with an eggplant dish such as a souffle, or a ratatouille.
  Another idea is a hot corn salad. For wine, either a sturdy white
  wine like a chardonnay or sauvignon, or a light red such as a pinot
  noir or Beaujolais.

      Title: BROILED EGGPLANT WITH WALNUT SAUCE
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------WALNUT SAUCE WITH FENNEL-----------------------
      1 c  Walnut meats
           -this season's, if possible
      1 sm Garlic clove: (see note)
    1/4 c  Fresh bread crumbs
  1 1/2 c  Boiling water, approximately
      3 ts Walnut or olive oil
    1/4 ts Fennel seeds, crushed
           -with a pestle
           Salt and pepper

MMMMM------------------------THE EGGPLANT-----------------------------
           Salt
      4    Rounds of eggplant
           - 3/8-to-1/2-inch thick
           Light olive or peanut oil
           Freshly ground pepper
           Parsley or fennel leaves
           - finely chopped
           - or left in sprigs
 
  WALNUT SAUCE WITH FENNEL: Put the walnuts, garlic and bread crumbs in
  a food processor and process briefly until everything is the texture
  of fine crumbs. With the motor running, gradually pour in about 1 cup
  of the water. Stop and scrape down the sides, then add enough water
  until it is the consistency you want. (It will thicken somewhat as it
  sits.) Stir in the oil and fennel seeds and season to taste with salt
  and pepper. THE EGGPLANT: If the eggplant is mature with lots of
  developed seeds when sliced, lightly salt the slices and let them sit
  for 30 minutes. Blot with paper towels to draw off bitter juices. If
  the eggplant is light-colored and firm, without the presence of large
  seeds, just slice it and go onto the next step. Preheat the broiler.
  Brush both sides of the eggplant generously with oil. Place about 3
  inches from the heat source and broil until golden brown. Turn the
  rounds over and broil until nicely colored and tender. If the
  eggplant looks dry, brush a little more oil over the top. Set the
  broiled eggplants on a platter and spoon a little of the walnut sauce
  over the tops. Season with pepper and garnish with the fennel leaves
  or parsley. Serve hot or slightly cooled. (NOTE: If you are not
  planning to use the sauce right away, omit the garlic and add it just
  before you use it. This way the sauce will keep well for at least a
  week, refrigerated)

  buttered foil.  Broil over hot coals or under high heat for 5 to 7

      Title: BROILED OR GRILLED MARINATED CHICKEN (GAI YAN
 Categories: Thai, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      3 tb Minced cilantro root
      3 tb Fish sauce
      3 tb Chinese light soy sauce
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
      1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Minced garlic (3 cloves)
      2 lb Chicken legs or breasts,
           -skin and fat removed
 
  A street and market food served everywhere in Thailand, this chicken
  is traditionally associated with the Northeast. At the train stations
  or bus stop, you can get a few skewers and a little bag of sticky
  rice for a delicious snack or light lunch. The marinade dates back to
  a time before the introduction of chilies by the Portuguese. Black
  peppercorns were used in enormous quantities, and they still have an
  important role in Thai cooking.
  
  Combine cilantro root, fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, pepper and
  garlic in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth and pour
  into a shallow, non aluminum dish. Add chicken and turn to coat
  evenly with marinade. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at
  least 1 hour or up to 8 hours, turning occasionally.
  
  Preheat the broiler or prepare a charcoal or gas grill. Drain the
  chicken and reserve the marinade for basting. Broil or grill the
  chicken on a lightly oiled rack approximately 3 inches from the heat
  for 10 minutes. Turn the chicken and baste with the reserved
  marinade. Discard any leftover marinade. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes
  longer, or until the outside is browned and the inside is no longer
  pink.

           -leaves washed
      6    Shiso or basil leaves,
           -sliced thin
      2 tb Chopped fresh chives or
           -scallion tops
 
  *Available at Asian markets and some supermarkets
  
  From: - Terra * St. Helena -
  
  1. In a shallow glass dish or stainless-steel pan, combine 1/2 cup of
  the soy sauce, 4 tablespoons of the mirin, the sake, 6 tablespoons of
  the sugar, 3/4 teaspoon of the ginger and 3/4 teaspoon of the garlic.
  Add the fish fillets and arrange them so that they are completely
  covered with the marinade. Let the Chilean sea bass marinate in the
  refrigerator for about 6 hours.
  
  2. In a large bowl, cover the rice noodles with warm water and leave
  to soften, about 10 minutes. Drain.
  
  3. In a small frying pan, toast the sesame seeds over moderate heat,
  stirring frequently, until light brown, about 3 minutes. Or toast
  them in a 350 B0 oven for 15 minutes.
  
  4. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the rice noodles
  until just done, about 3 minutes. Drain.
  
  5. Heat the broiler. Drain the fish and discard the marinade. Put the
  fish on a baking sheet and broil until the fish is just cooked
  through, about 5 minutes.
  
  6. Meanwhile, in a medium pot, combine the remaining 1/4 cup soy
  sauce, 2-1/2 tablespoons mirin, 1-1/2 teaspoons sugar, 1/4 teaspoon
  ginger, 1/4 teaspoon garlic, the Chicken Stock, rice-wine vinegar and
  sesame oil. Bring to a boil over moderately high heat. Add the
  carrot, leek and mushrooms and simmer for 1 minute. Add the cooked
  noodles, the spinach and two thirds of the shiso leaves. Simmer for
  30 seconds longer.
  
  7. Transfer the noodles and vegetables to plates. Pour on the broth
  and top with the fish. Sprinkle the fish with the toasted sesame
  seeds, the remaining shiso leaves and the chives.
  
  Chilean sea bass has a very different texture from that of other
  fish. Even when it is cooked to well-done, the fish remains soft.
  Since it doesn't firm up, you'll need to check its temperature to
  tell whether it's done. Stab a small bamboo stick into the middle of
  the fillet. Leave for a moment, pull it out and touch the end. If
  it's hot, the fish is ready.
  
  Chilean sea bass is not interchangeable with other bass. If you can't
  find it, cod is a closer substitute than a different type of sea
  bass. In place of the shiso leaves, you can use basil. Sweet sherry,
  while not as sweet as mirin, can be used in its place.
  
  A dry gew FCrztraminer or riesling from the Napa Valley or Alsace has
  almost the same balance of sweetness and acidity as the sake, and
  complements the ginger and shiso.

           Stephen Ceideburg
      4    Green New Mexican chilies
           -or:
    1/2 sm Green bell pepper plus:
      2    Jalapenos
      2 ts Chopped scallions, including
           -green tops
      2 ts Vegetable oil
      3 tb Green peppercorns in brine,
           -drained

    1/2 c  Dry white wine
    1/4 c  Skim milk
      1 tb Hot-pepper sauce, preferably
           -habanero chili sauce
      1 tb Chopped fresh dill
      4    Salmon steaks, 6 oz each
 
  Note: In place of the fresh chilies, you can use canned green ones,
  which do not need to be roasted and peeled. Drain them well.
  
  Preheat broiler. On a foil-lined baking sheet, broil peppers for 7 to
  8 minutes, or until blackened, turning once. Place in a paper bag and
  set aside until cooled. Remove skin, stems and seeds. Chop finely.
  
  In a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat, saute scallions in oil
  for 2 minutes until softened. Add green peppercorns and saute for 2
  minutes more. Add flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
  Stir in wine and milk and blend well. Add chilies, hot-pepper sauce
  and dill. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer about 5
  minutes, or until the sauce has been reduced and thickened.
  
  Broil salmon for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until fish flesh is
  opaque. Remove the skin from the steaks before serving. Place some of

      Title: BROILED SCALLOPS & BACON HORS D'OEUVRES
 Categories: Pork, Seafood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Sea scallops
    1/3    Bacon
 
  Recipe by: Felicia Pickering <MNHAN063@SIVM.SI.EDU> Remove any tough
  cartilage from the sides of the scallops, wipe off any bits of shell,
  and pat them dry. In a large frying pan, partially cook bacon until
  it has released its fat but is still limp and flexible; remove it to
  brown paper or paper towels and drain it well. Cut the bacon pieces
  in halves or thirds so that they are just long enough to wrap around
  a scallop with a slight overlap.  Wrap each scallop with a piece of
  bacon and secure the wrap with a toothpick. Place the wrapped
  scallops on a rack that is set in a baking pan and cook under a
  preheated broiler, turning once, just until the bacon is crisp and
  the scallops are opaque. Serve immediately.
  
  Variations: Roll the scallops in pancetta or prosciutto instead of
  bacon. Add something crunchy - a length of scallion or a thin slice
  of kohlrabi - next to the scallop before rolling it in the bacon.
  Substitute drained water chestnuts for one-third of the scallops

      Title: BROILED TOMATOES #1
 Categories: Mexico, Sauce/gravy
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Tomatoes
 
  Many Mexican recipes call for tomatoes to be asados (roasted).
  Traditionally they are put onto a hot comal and cooked until the skin
  is wrinkled and brown and the flesh is soft right through--this takes
  about 20 to 25 minutes for an 8 ounce tomato.  However, since this
  method is very messy, it is best to line a shallow metal pan with
  foil and put the tomatoes in it. Place them under a hot broiler--do
  not have the flame too high or the tomato will burn without cooking
  through--and turn them from time to time so that they cook through
  evenly--the skin will be blistered and charred. A medium tomato will
  take about 20 minutes. Blend the tomato, skin, core, and seeds to a
  fairly smoothe sauce. The skin and core give both body and flavor to
  the sauce. And never mind if the skin ~is- charred; that adds
  character, too.  If the skin is very badly blackened and hard in
  places, then remove a little of it. This method of cooking tomatoes
  makes for a very rich-flavored sauce. FromThe Cuisines of Mexico by
  Diana Kennedy, 1972.

      4 sl Lemon
      2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  1.  Place the shrimp, cream, ginger, shallots, Tabasco and salt and
  pepper to taste in the bowl of a food processor. Start blending,
  puree until the mixture is smooth and thick. This should take about
  30 to 40 seconds.

  and spread the mixture evenly on the right fillet of the open trout.
  Fold the left fillet to enclose the stuffing.
  
  3.  Pour the milk in a shallow platter and mix the flour with salt and
  pepper onto a flat dish. Dip each trout in the milk, remove excess and
  dredge in the flour mixture, patting to be sure the flour adheres.
  
  4.  Heat the oil in a non-stick skillet large enough to hold the
  trout in one layer without crowding. Add the trout and brown
  thoroughly on one side. Then turn the trout with a spatula on the
  other side, the process should take about 4 `minutes on side
  depending on the thickness of the trout. While the fish is browning
  on the second side, baste the top with hot oil from the pan to
  prevent them from drying out. Transfer to a warm platter, keep warm.
  
  5.  While the pan is still warm, wipe it out with a paper towel and
  return it to medium heat to melt the butter and cook until the butter
  is a hazelnut color. Add the lemon juice, pour and divide the butter
  over the trout. Garnish with the lemon slices and sprinkle the

      Yield: 12 Pancakes
 
  1 1/3 c  Flour
      2 tb Sugar
      3 ts Baking powder
    3/4 ts Salt
      1    Egg, slightly beaten
  1 1/4 c  Milk
      3 tb Oil
 
  Sift flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into a mixing bowl. Make a
  well in the center.
  
  In a small bowl blend together the egg, milk and salad oil. Beat with
  a whisk or rotary beater until smooth.
  
  Slowly heat griddle.  Grease it lightly if necessary. Heat until a
  drop of cold water bounces on the hot griddle (or follow instructions
  for your griddle).
  
  Add liquid ingredients all at once to the flour mixture. Beat with a
  rotary beater until smooth. Pour batter by the 1/4 cupful onto the
  griddle. Don't crowd pancakes, or they will be difficult to turn.
  Bake until pancake is puffed, the surface is full of bubbles (with
  just a few beginning to break), and the underside is golden brown.
  (The top will start to stop looking shiny.) Turn pancakes only once.
  Serve immediately with plenty of butter and syrup.
  
  Yield:  12 4-inch pancakes.

  dissolves and the mixture begins to boil, raise the heat and bring
  the mixture to 290 on a cooking thermometer. It will be light brown
  in color and syrup will separate into threads that are not brittle
  when dribbled into cold water. Quickly stir in 1/2 cup chopped
  almonds. Immediately pour the mixture onto an ungreased baking sheet.
  Wait 2-3 minutes for the candy surface to firm,, then sprinkle onthe
  chocolate chips. IN a few minutes, when the chips have softened,
  spread the chocolate evenly over the surface. Sprinkle the remaining
  almonds over the melted chocolated.When the chocolate hardens, crack
  the candy into pieces, store covered. NOTE: Heath bar or hersheys.
  These two candy bars are very similar, and both are composed of
  ingredients similar to those in ALmond roca. One obvious difference
  is that thre are no almonds on top of these bars. To make these candy

      Title: BROWN 'N' SERVE SAUSAGE
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 lb Lean ground pork
    1/4 c  Cracker crumbs
    1/4 c  Water
      1 ts Sage
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      1 pn Ground cloves
 
  The two step cooking procedure ensures the removal of most of the fat.
  
  Combine ground pork and cracker crumbs.  Stir in water, sage, salt,
  thyme, oregano, pepper and cloves. Mix until thoroughly combined.
  
  Divide into 12 portions.  Form each into a sausage-shaped roll or flat
  patty.  (Wet hands with cold water to make the job easy.) Place in a
  cold, lightly oiled frypan.
  
  Cook over medium heat, turning often, about 4 min each side until just
  beginning to brown and pieces are no longer pink.
  
  Remove to paper towels and blot to absorb any fat. Wrap. Store in
  refrigerator up to 5 days or in freezer up to 2 months. Or cook a
  second time and serve immediately.
  
  To serve:  Return sausages or patties to a clean, cold frypan. Cook
  over medium heat, turning once or twice, about 4 min until sausages
  are brown and crisp.  (Cook frozen sausages in the same manner,
  allowing about 2 min longer for cooking.
  
  Each sausage or patty - 59 calories, 1 protein choice 1 g
  carbohydrate, 7 g protein, 3 g fat.

  Suggestion for Pork Pies: Stir-cook the ground pork mixture in the
  frying pan, place it in a plastic colander to drain off most of the
  fat and blot with paper towels. Spread the pork mixture in a baking
  dish (try 8" pyrex), add fat-free gravy if needed for liquid. Top
  with about 2 1/4 cups seasoned breadcrumbs.  Bake at 350-375 F until
  crumbs are lightly browned.
  
  1/12 recipe = 10 grams carbohydrate, 9 grams protein, 4 grams fat, 113
  calories.  Compare with 1/12 recipe Betty Crocker Pork Pies made with
  1 lb sausage and 1 c cooked ham, cream of chicken soup, apples,
  pastry: 19.5 gm carbohydrate, 10 gm protein, 15 grams fat, 250

 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Chopped
           Cilantro
      6    Thin ginger slices (I used
           More)
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
  2 1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Honey or brn. sugar

MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
      3 c  Cooked and cooled Wild Blend
           Rice (I used Lundberg
           Blend)
      3 c  Cooked and cooled Basmati
           Rice (these can be cooked
           Together)
      1 ts Ground chilli (I used
           Cayenne pepper)
      1 c  Green beans thinly sliced
           Steamed and cooled
      1 c  Snow peas, thinly sliced
      1    Cucumber thinly sliced and
           Quartered
      1 c  Bean sprouts
      1 c  Finely diced orange
      1 c  Finely diced tart apple
           Chunks
      1 cn Sliced water chestnuts
    1/2 c  Chopped cilantro
  1 1/2 tb Lime juice
 
  Sauce: Combine sauce ingredients in saucepan, bring to rolling boil.
  Reduce heat, simmer until sauce is consistency of maple syrup, about
  20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.
  
  My personal preference is to half the soy sauce, water and honey or
  brn. sugar.  You may want to experiment by making a whole batch and
  adding it to the salad to suit your preference. I used a considerable
  amount more cilantro, lime, and ginger than the recipe calls for but
  I love spicy things.
  
  Combine salad ingredients, drizzle sauce over and toss gently. Chill
  and serve.

  small chunks.  Cook in boiling salted water until tender (I'd prefer
  to steam them). Drain well.
  
  Cool the rice & vegetables & mix together with the bell pepper. Stir
  in half the nuts & place in a serving bowl. Sprinkle with the
  remaining nuts. Serve with an oil & vinegar dressing if liked.

      Title: BROWN RICE & WHEAT BERRIES (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/4 c  Water
    1/3 c  Wheat berries
    1/3 c  Brown rice
      1 tb Saute fluid (pick your a
           Compatible favoriet)
    1/4 c  Chopped scallion
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
 
  In 2qt pan, boil water. Add berries, return to boil. Reduce heat,
  simmer, covered, 1 hour. Stir in brown rice. Cover, simmer 50 minutes
  longer. 5 minutes before rice is finished, saute scallion until
  softened. Combi ne with rice and wheat mixture, along with spices.
  
  Note: The original recipe called for 2 Tbs. pignoli (pine nuts),
  tosted in 1 Tbs butter, before adding the scallions. I simply
  eliminated them. I'll run both combinations through my recipe
  program, and re-post if it can be done <= 10% cff. The original
  recipe's 'Health Tip' suggested omitting salt, substituting unsalted
  margarine, and/or eliminating the nuts.

      Title: BROWN RICE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 c  Brown rice flour (900 g)
      1 tb Salt (16.5 g)
  2 2/3 c  Tepid water (635 ml)
      4 ts Active dry yeast (1/2 oz or
           -14 g)
    1/2 c  Warm water (120 ml)
      2 tb Honey (30 ml)
    1/4 c  Oil (60 g)
    1/4 c  Methocel (28 g)
 
  The flour in this bread must be from short-or medium-grain rice, not
  long-grain rice.  Start this bread 12 to 18 hours before you want to
  bake.
  
  Mix the rice flour and the salt, and make a well in the middle. Pour
  in the water, mixing gradually from the center outward. Beat
  vigorously for ten minutes either by hand, with a wooden spoon, or
  with an electric beater at medium speed, to smooth and aerate the
  batter. Let the mixture stand at room temperature for 12 to 18 hours.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in warm water.  Stir the yeast solution, then the
  honey and oil into the grain mixture and mix thoroughly by hand or
  machine until completely smooth and uniform.  Add the methocel and
  mix thoroughly again; the dough will become very stiff. (See the tips
  below.)
  
  Spoon into three well-greased 8" x 4" loaf pans.  Wet your fingers
  with water or oil and smooth the tops. Keep the loaves in a warm (80
  deg.F) and humid place to rise, until the batter reaches the top of
  the pans. Watch the surface of the dough and be ready to put the
  bread into a preheated oven as soon as the first tiny pinholes appear
  on the top. Bake at 350 deg.F. for about 45 minutes, or until done.
  Allow to cool thoroughly before slicing.
  
  SOME TIPS: If the dough was too stiff, its surface will be full of
  holes before it can rise, and the bread will be dense. If it is too
  wet, it will rise up in a big arch like wheat bread, but it will
  collapse. With a little practice you will get a feeling for the
  proper consistency.
  
  Don't try to substitute butter or shortening for the oil in this
  recipe because they will affect the methocel function.
  
  Store the bread in a plastic bag in the refrigerator, and freeze the
  extra two loaves until you need them, as the bread tends to stale
  quickly.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Cooked brown rice
           Half block of tofu
      1 lg Onion
      2 md Carrots
      2    Celery stalks

      6 oz Mushrooms, wiped clean
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Butter
      3    Garlic cloves;
           - finely chopped
      1 ts Nutritional yeast (optional)
      1 ts Ground cumin seeds
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Mushroom broth; -=OR=-
           - Vegetable stock, or water
      6 oz Grated cheese
           -(Jack, muenster, Cheddar
           - or Gouda)
           Pepper
           Fresh herbs, for garnish
           -(Parsley or Cilantro,
           -Thyme, Marjoram)
 
  COOK RICE. SET THE TOFU on a slanted board or pan to drain, and
  prepare the vegetables. Chop the onion, carrots, celery, pepper, and
  zucchini into pieces about 1/2-inch square. Quarter mushrooms if they
  are small, and cut them into sixths or eighths if they are large. Cut
  the tofu into 1/2-inch cubes. Heat the olive oil and the butter and
  fry the onion over medium heat until it is lightly browned, about 5
  minutes. Add the garlic, nutritional yeast, if using, cumin and salt.
  Stir until blended and cook for 1 minute. Add the carrots, celery,
  green pepper and 1/2 cup of the liquid, cover pan, and braise the
  vegetables until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the
  zucchini and mushrooms and cook 7 to 10 minutes. The vegetables
  should be nearly, but not completely, cooked. If the pan gets dry
  while they cook, add a little more liquid. Preheat oven to 350F.
  Combine the vegetables with rice and cheese. Season with salt and
  plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Gently mix in the tofu, and
  put mixture into lightly oiled casserole. Add a little more liquid to
  moisten. Cover with foil and bake 1/2 hour. Remove foil and bake 15
  minutes. Garnish with fresh herbs.

      Title: BROWN RICE INFORMATION
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
 
  Natural Brown Rice ================== Brown rice is the whole grain
  which retains a natural coating of bran. This rice bran can be an
  important weapon in the fight against cholesterol.  Research has
  shown rice bran to be effective in lowering blood cholesterol levels.
  
  Brown rice contains 10% rice bran.  In addition to lowering
  cholesterol, the rice bran layer gives the rice a light tan color, a
  subtle, nut-like flavor and an interesting chewy texture. Brown rice
  provides slightly more fiber, Vitamin E, protein, phosphorus,
  riboflavin, and calcium than white rice.  However, most white rice is
  enriched and therefore provides more thiamin and iron.
  
  The key to a healthy diet is eating a variety of foods... and avoiding
  foods that are high in fat, sugar, and sodium. Consume half your
  calories ~- if not more -- from foods that are high in complex
  carbohydrates, such as grains (like rice), fruits, and vegetables.
  After all, fats are fattening.  One gram of fat has 9 calories but
  one gram of carbohydrate has only 4.
  
  Nutrition Information Per Serving =================================

      1 lb Cajun-style sausage
      3 md Garlic cloves, peeled
      1 md Onion, peeled, cubed
      1 md Green bell pepper, cored,
           -cut in 1-inch squares
      2 md Tomatoes, peeled, cored,
           -quartered
  1 1/2 c  Raw brown rice
    1/2 ts Each, dried oregano leaves,
           -dried thyme leaves, file
           Powder, ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Each, cayenne pepper,
           -ground cumin
      3 c  Chicken broth
           Salt
    1/2 lb Peeled, deveined raw shrimp
 
  I seem to remember you being involved in a conversation about brown
  rice a few months back... Here's something that you might find
  interesting.
  
  Put ham or bacon in a 4-quart soup kettle and cook over low heat
  until fat is rendered.  Increase heat to medium and stir until
  cooked, about 5 minutes.
  
  Remove chicken skin, cut meat off the bones and then cut boneless
  chicken into bite-size pieces.  Add to kettle or skillet with bacon
  or ham and toss until color turns pale, about 4 minutes. Remove bacon
  or ham and chicken with a slotted spoon and put on paper toweling;
  set aside. Add sausage to kettle and brown all over, about 6 to 8
  minutes; remove. Leave 2 tablespoons fat in kettle; pour off and
  discard remaining fat.
  
  Insert metal blade in food processor.  Mince garlic by adding to
  machine with motor on.  Add onion and chop very coarsely with half
  second pulses. Add green pepper and process with half-second pulses
  until mixture is chopped to medium consistency.  Add mixture to
  kettle and stir over low heat until softened, about 10 minutes.
  Process tomatoes until pureed; set aside.
  
  Add rice to ingredients in kettle and stir over low heat for 2
  minutes. Then stir in oregano Thyme, file, black pepper, cayenne
  pepper and cumin. Add tomatoes and broth. Stir well and let mixture
  to boiling. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook rice mixture 15 to 20
  minutes. Cut sausage into 1/4-inch thick coin like slices. Mix
  sausage, ham and chicken pieces into rice.  Cover and cook until rice
  is tender (rice may not absorb all the liquid) about 20 minutes
  longer. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding salt as needed. Stir
  shrimp into hot rice mixture, cover pot and let stand for 8 to 10
  minutes.  Serve rice with shrimp, meats and liquid.
  
  Serves 8.

      Title: BROWN SUGAR FUDGE
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  White Sugar; Granulated
      1 c  Light Brown Sugar; Firm Pack
    1/2 c  Heavy (Whipping) Cream
      3 tb Molasses; *
      2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate; 2 Sqs
      4 tb Butter; 1/2 stick
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Chopped Nuts; Optional
 
  *    This is to taste.  The original recipe called for 4 Tbls of
  Molasses, STEP 1:  PREPARE: Prewarm the thermometer in hot water; use
  a 2-quart saucepan; butter the upper sides (inside) of the saucepan;
  measure all ingredients except the vanilla and optionals, and dump
  into the saucepan. Grease and if necessary, line a 5 X 10-inch pan.
  Fill glass with ice cubes and water and the sink with 1/2 inch of
  cold water. STEP 2: Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a
  wooden spoon, over low heat until the butter melts, the gritty sounds
  cease, and the spoon glides smoothly over the bottom of the pan.
  Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil. STEP 3: Boil, after
  washing down any crystals that may have formed, with a pastry brush
  dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath, using as little water
  as possible. Introduce the prewarmed thermometer. Reduce the heat
  while keeping the fudge at a boil. Stir no more than necessary. STEP
  4: Test the fudge mixture in the ice-cold water when the mixture
  thickens and bubbles become noisy. Ball, formed in ice water, should
  hold its shape until the heat from your had begins to flatten it and
  should be al dente ~- slightly chewy -- between 230 and 240 (110 and
  115.5 degrees C.). Because of the molasses and brown sugar, it can
  ball at a lower temperature than some other fudges. STEP 5: Shock by
  placing the saucepan in the cold water in the sink. STEP 6: Seed by
  adding, without stirring, the vanilla. Then allow to cool. STEP 7:
  Stir when luke warm and "skin" forms on the top (110 degrees F.(43.5
  degrees C.)). Return the thermometer to its hot water bath to soak
  clean. Stir the fudge thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with an
  electric mixer, or with a food processor. Pause frequently to allow
  the fudge to react. STEP 8: Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its
  sheen, and become lighter in color or streaked with lighter shade,
  give off some heat, suddenly stiffen. If mixing by had, the fudge
  will "snap" with each stroke; by mixer, mixer waves will become very
  distinct, by food processor, fudge will flow sluggishly back to the
  center when the processor is stopped. STEP 9: Add the optionals (1/2
  Cup Chopped Nuts (walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts (filberts)) before
  the fudge totally candies. STEP 10: Pour, score, and store when cool
  in an airtight container in the refrigerator or at room temperature.
  YIELD: 1 pound of fudge. Recipe is easily doubled and can be frozen.
  VARIATIONS: HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eleminate the
  unsweetened chocolate and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey.
  The honey causes the fudge to ball at a higher temperature. CHOCOLATE
  HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, replace the heavy cream with
  light cream or evaporated milk and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup
  of honey. ORANGE BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eleminate molasses,
  chocolate but add 1 Tbl corn syrup.  In Step 6, add 1 Tbl grated
  orange zest, plus if you can get it, 1 tsp of pure orange extract.
  PEANUT BUTTER BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eliminate the molasses
  and chocolate, replace the heavy cream with 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4
  cup of creamy peanut butter. To intensify the peanut butter flavor,
  add 1/3 of a cup of salted peanuts in Step 9. PRALINE BROWN SUGAR
  FUDGE:  In Step 1, eliminating the molasses is optional -- you'ss get
  a more Southern praline with it, a milder one without it--or
  compromise and use only 1 Tbls.  Eliminate the chocolate. In Step 3,
  when the mixture begins to thicken, add 1 1/2 cups of pecan halves
  slowly so as not to break the boil or cool the mixture too quickly.

  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
      1    Vanilla pod,
           ***OR***
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 sm Loaf stale French stick
      4 tb Softened butter for spread
    1/2 c  Raisins (plumped in water)
           Finely grated zest of
           1 lemon **OR** 1 orange
    1/4 c  Sugar
      4    Whole eggs
      4    Egg yolks
      1 oz Dark rum
      2 tb Sugar, for sprinkling
 
  In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine milk, cream and vanilla.
  Slowly bring almost to the boiling point, remove from heat and let
  stand 30 minutes. Remove and discard vanilla pod before serving. Cut
  the bread into thick (1/2 inch) slices, removing the crusts if
  desired. Spread each slice thinly with butter and cut into quarters
  (or halves if slices are very small). In a large buttered baking dish
  (casserole or souffle), arrange one-third of the buttered bread in a
  layer on the bottom. Sprinkle a half each of the raisins, lemon or
  orange zest and sugar evenly on top. Arrange another one-third of the
  bread on top, sprinkle with remaining raisins, zest and sugar.
  Arrange the remaining bread, buttered side up, on top. In a bowl,
  lightly beat the eggs and yolks with the milk, cream and rum. Pour
  this mixture into a spouted jug, for easier pouring. Pour the egg
  mixture down into the side of the baking dish. Avoid getting the top
  layer wet or it won't crisp up. (Depending on the volume of the dish,
  you may not use all the mixture, or you may need to add a little milk
  so the liquid comes up almost to the top layer. Sprinkle sugar on
  top. Place the baking dish in a large roasting pan containing a
  shallow layer of boiling water. Place in a 350F oven and bake for
  about 30 to 40 minutes, until the custard is set and the top is brown
  and crusty. Serve hot from the dish accompanied by creme anglaise.

      Title: BROWNIE CAKES IN A JAR
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Canning jars;wide mouth
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon (optional)
    1/3 c  Butter;or Margarine
    1/4 c  -Water
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
    1/4 c  Buttermilk
      1    Egg; beaten
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 c  Walnuts; finely chopped
 
  Here's one you can start out with, it makes 2 jars. Every recipe
  technique is the same, just different ingredients.. Sterilize, two
  1-pint straight-sided wide-mouth canning jars (specifically made for
  canning jams and jellies) lids and rings by boiling for 10 minutes
  (keep the lids and rings in the hot water until ready to use); set
  aside. In a small bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking soda and
  cinnamon, if desired. Set aside. In a medium saucepan combine butter
  or margarine, water and cocoa powder; heat and stir until butter or
  margarine is melted and mixture is well blended. Remove from heat;
  stir in flour mixture. Add buttermilk, egg and vanilla; beat by hand
  until smooth. Stir in nuts. Pour mixture into the prepared canning
  jars; place jars onto a cookie sheet. Preheat oven to 325-degrees.
  Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into each cake
  comes out clean. Remove cakes from the oven, one at a time. Place a
  lid, then a ring onto the jars and screw down tightly. USE HEAVY-DUTY
  MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!!
  
  Place jars onto your counter to cool. You'll hear a "plinking" sound.
  If you miss the sound, wait until the cakes are cool and press on the
  lids, they shouldn't move at all, that means they've sealed.
  
  Store cakes in a cool, dark place. They should last up to a year--I
  don't know, they've never lasted that long around here! If you'd like
  to decorate them, place a wad of cotton in the center of each lid,
  then place a piece of decorative cloth, about 3-inches larger in
  circumference than the lid, (cut with pinking shears) on top of the
  cotton. Screw the ring back on (by this time the rings can be removed
  as the lids should be sealed). Use your imagination when
  decorating--a hot glue gun works wonders (dried flowers, ribbon,
  etc). These make WONDERFUL Christmas gifts.

      Title: BROWNIE COOKIES
 Categories: Desserts, Cookies, Chocolate
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
      4 oz Semisweet chocolate
      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
  2 1/3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      1 tb Vanilla extract
      2 ea Egg
      1 tb Milk
    3/4 c  Finely chopped walnuts
 
  1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. 2.  Sift the flour, baking
  soda, and baking powder together. Set aside. 3. In the bowl of a
  mixer, cream the butter. Add the sugar slowly and continue to beat.
  Add the vanilla, then the eggs 1 at a time. Add the chocolate and
  stir to blend. 4. Stir in the dry ingredients and the milk by hand.
  When just blended, mix in the walnuts. Cover and refrigerate dough
  for 30 minutes before rolling. 5. Preheat oven to 375 degres. Lightly
  grease a cookie sheet. 6. To form the cookies, scoop out a portion of
  dough and roll out on a well-floured surface. When dough is 1/4 inch
  thick, cut it into rounds or other desired shapes. Re-roll scraps and
  cut again. 7. Place on cookie sheet (leave room for expansion) and
  bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Watch for any hot spots in the oven and
  don't let these cookies overbrown. VARIATION: For the Brownie Cookie
  Crust, make 1 recipe of Brownie Cookies and chill the dough briefly.
  Lightly grease the back side of a large baking sheet. Roll the dough
  out onto the baking sheet as thinly as possible so that the baked
  product will crumble easily. Bake crust at 375 degrees for 5 to 7
  minutes. Let crust harden, then slide the cookie from the sheet and
  cool completely. Roll over the cookie with a rolling pin until it is
  crushed to a fine crumb. (There should be about 2 1/4 cups of
  crumbs.) Melt 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter. Mix it
  into the crumbs and pack the mixture over the bottom and up the sides
  of a 10-inch springform pan. Freeze for 30 minutes before filling in
  order to set the crust. Note: When I made this, I made individual
  cookie crumb crusts for the "Kit's Chocolate Mousse" recipe by using
  a large muffin pan.  Line each cup with waxed paper for easy removal.

  Folks--your guess is as good as mine as to how, exactly, to make
  these, as well as the number of servings (I took a stab at it).
  
  Was downloading my packet yesterday, when I heard them talking about
  this recipe on the TV and quickly ran for paper & pencil. There were
  no real clear directions given (or I missed them) so you're on your
  own!
  
  Cook the dates and water in a microwave for 5 minutes. Stir. That's
  all I heard.  I also don't know exactly how many servings, but they
  clearly said each brownie was only 110 calories and 0.5g fat.

      Title: BROWNING & FRYING ONIONS
 Categories: How, Mine
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  Usually when an Indian recipe calls for golden brown or caramelized
  onions, the onions are browned in a fairly large amount of oil. Here
  is a method requiring very little oil using a non-stick pan.
  
  Slice the onions into very thin, even slices or chop the onions into
  small uniform pieces. heat about 1 tablespoon of oil over moderate
  heat. The amount of oil depends upon the amount of onions to be
  cooked. Stir the onions for 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Add
  about 2 tablespoons of water and continue cooking, stirring
  constantly. If cooking large quantities, add additional water 1
  tablespoon at a time if the onions begin sticking to the pan or fry
  too rapidly. This allows the natural moisture of the onions to be
  coaxed out while browning. Continue frying until the onions are
  golden brown. This process can take about 20 minutes. When simmered
  slowly, the onions add a rich dimension and melt into the sauce,
  thickening it as well. Brown fried onions can be prepared in large
  quantities and refrigerated or frozen and defrosted when needed. Once
  defrosted, they cannot be refrozen so it is best to package them in
  small quantities.

 Categories: Salads, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Head of Romaine Lettuce
           Tin of Anchovy Filets
      1 tb Fresh Ground Black Pepper
      4 cl Garlic
           Egg Yolk-use Extra Large Egg
      1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
    3/4 c  Olive Oil
           Red Wine Vinegar
           Lemon
           Fresh Grated Parmesan
           Cheese
      1 tb Prepared Hot Mustard
      3 ds Tobasco Sauce
           Croutons
    1/2 lb Bacon
 
  1) Cook the bacon until very crisp. Set aside and allow to drain on
  paper
     towels.
  
  2) Place egg in a glass of warm water and set aside until it reaches
  room
     temperature (10-15 minutes).
  
  3) Crush the garlic in a large wooden bowl. Add the anchovies and
  crush
     into a pulpy mass. Mix with black pepper.
  
  4) Add mustard, worcestershire sauce and tobasco. Separate the egg,
  keeping
     the yolk. If you can't find any extra large eggs then 2 small eggs
  is
     fine. Stir in each of these ingredients thoroughly as you add each
  one.
  
  5) SLOWLY add the oil from the anchovy tin, using a french whisk to
  mix.
  
  6) SLOWLY add olive oil, rapidly whipping until you get a thick
  paste. You
     may have to vary the amount of oil to achieve this (at least 3/4
  cup).
  
  7) Squeeze in some red wine vinegar to taste. Once around the bowl is
     usually enough.
  
  8) Squeeze in one lemon for the juice, again to taste.
  
  9) Just before serving, add the lettuce, croutons, crushed bacon and
     parmesan cheese. Toss Thoroughly.
  
  The trick to this is the dressing should be quite thick before adding
  the red wine vinegar and lemon juice.
  
  You may want to add more garlic, tobasco, worcestershire, mustard
  depending on how spicy you like your Caesar Salad. From the kitchen

      Title: BRUNCH SPUD BOATS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 md Baking potatoes, scrubbed
           No-stick cooking spray
      2 tb Olive oil
      3 oz Chopped lean ham or
           -Canadian bacon
    1/3 c  Diced zucchini
    1/3 c  Diced red bell pepper
      3    Green onions, with tops,
           -sliced
      6    Eggs, beaten
      2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
           Salsa for serving
 
  To make potato shells: Prick potatoes with a fork and bake in a
  microwave oven on a plate on high (100 percent) 7 to 11 minutes,
  rotating after 3 minutes, until tender when pierced with a knife. Or
  bake in a conventional oven at 450 degrees 50 to 60 minutes. They
  should be soft but firm enough to dice.
  
  Preheat oven to broil. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out
  pulp, leaving a  1/2-inch shell. Dice scooped-out potato. Spray both
  sides of potato shell with cooking spray. Place right side up on a
  baking sheet and broil until edges are browned and top is slightly
  crisp but not dry, 3 to 4 minutes. (Shells may be refrigerated
  overnight. Refrigerate cooked potato separately. Bring both to room
  temperature before filling.)
  
  To make filling: Preheat oven to 500 degrees. In a large skillet,
  preferably non-stick, over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil until
  hot. Saute potato pulp, turning with a spatula until they begin to
  turn golden, about 5 minutes, adding more oil if needed. Stir in ham,
  zucchini and red pepper and saute, stirring, until vegetables soften
  slightly, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, reduce heat to medium-low, and
  cook, stirring lightly, until very loosely set. Stir in green onions.
  Fill potato shells and sprinkle tops with cheese, if desired. Place
  potatoes on baking sheet and bake 5 minutes, or until eggs are set
  and cheese melts. Serve with salsa, if desired.

           Salt and black pepper (to
           -taste)
 
  Pour the bouillion into a large pot.  Be careful not to allow any
  sediment to be added.  Lightly beat the egg whites with the water and
  add this to the bouillion with the crushed egg shells. Bring the
  stock to a boil and simmer for 1 hour.  Skim the foam from the top
  and strain the stock through a sieve that has been lined with several
  layers of cheese cloth. You now have a clear consomme. Melt the
  butter in a small saucepan and add the finely diced and sliced
  vegetables. Spoon 2 or 3 Tbsp. of the consomme over the vegetables,
  cover the pan, and braise the vegetables slowly for about 10 minutes
  or until tender. To serve, reheat the consomme and garnish it with
  the braised vegetables. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.

      Title: BRUNSWICK STEW #4
 Categories: Poultry, Soups/stews
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6 lb Stewing hen
           (or two 3 lb broilers)
      2 lg Onions, sliced
      2 c  Okra, cut (optional)
      4 c  Fresh OR
           2(l lb cans tomatoes)
      2 c  Lima beans, frozen
      3 md Potatoes, diced
      4 c  Corn cut from cob OR
           2 (cans of corn, 1 lb each)
      3 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper
      1 tb Sugar
 
  Cut chicken in pieces and simmer in 3 quarts of water for a THIN
  stew, or 2 quarts of water for a THICK stew, until meat can easily be
  removed from the bones, about 2 1/4 hours. Remove chicken and let
  cool.
  
  Add the vegetables to the broth and simmer uncovered until the beans
  and potatoes are tender.  Stir occasionally to prevent scorching. Add
  the chicken deboned and diced, or in sections. Add the seasonings.
  
  NOTE:  If canned vegetables are used, include their juices and reduce
  water to 2 quarts for a thin stew, and 1 quart for a thick stew.
  
  ALSO NOTE:  Brunswick Stew is one of those delectable things that
  benefit from long, slow cooking.   It is a rule in some homes never
  to eat Brunswick Stew the same day it is made, because its flavor
  improves if it is left to stand overnight and is reheated the next
  day.

      Title: BUBBA TOM'S EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA STYLE BARB
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    5-8 lb Boston Butt Pork
           -Roast, smoked
      1    Masonjar Apple Cider Vinegar
      4 tb Cayenne Pepper Flakes
      8    Bulbs garlic
           PAN SAUCE-----
     12 oz Apple Cider Vinegar
      2 tb Cayenne Pepper Flakes
      1 tb Salt
      2 c  Water
 
  While nothing can duplicate the sweet ambrosia of slow, pit-cooked,
  whole hog Eastern North Carolina barbeque, this is a right close
  backyard approximation for those of us who find themselves exiled in
  distant, heathen regions of barbeque heresy.
  
  First, get yourself some pork shoulders or Boston Butt roasts, as
  many as your smoker will hold comfortably. I use a Brinkmann
  Professional Pit Smoker with an offset firebox, but you can do this
  with a vertical Brinkmann water smoker as well. The key is providing
  a moist, smoky, indirect heat for a long period of time.
  
  What I do is put a bag of charcoal in the firebox, open the vents,
  light it, and let it burn down to coals. Then I add wood (generally
  oak, since hickory is scarce up here)--two parts wet (soaked) wood to
  one part dry--regulate the dampers, and put the shoulders or butts,
  fat side up, in the cooking chamber. Beneath the meat I put a drip
  pan half-filled with apple cider vinegar. You must keep the heat
  between 180-260 degrees throughout the smoking process; the optimum
  range is 220-240 degrees. Normally, I'll add apple wood to the
  firebox as well, and I always add between 5-7 whole heads of garlic
  during the process. Keep the firebox fed and a good smoke going for
  between 8 to 10 hours. Do not open the cooking chamber to baste the
  meat--the only time you open the cooking chamber is when the
  temperature spikes above 260 degrees, and you open it only long
  enough to bring the temperature back in the proper range. By the time
  the smoking period is finished, the outside of the pork will have a
  golden amber to dark brown crust.
  
  Now, take the meat and put it in a covered Dutch oven. If it's too
  dark outside to continue, preheat your indoor stoves' oven to just
  under 300 degrees; otherwise, just raise the temperature in the
  cooking chamber a like amount. Get a quart-sized Mason jar; fill it
  halfway with apple cider vinegar, add one (or more) teaspoons of red
  pepper flakes, and fill the rest of the jar with water. Dump this
  into the Dutch oven with the pork, cover, and cook until the meat
  falls from the bone, about 2 more hours or so.
  
  When the meat is done, let it cool a bit. [NOTE: If you're too tired,
  you can stop here for the day--cover 'em up, put them in the fridge,
  and warm 'em up the next morning and continue
  
  the procedure]. While it's cooling, fill some 16 ounce bottles with
  apple cider vinegar, adding about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to
  each one (I use Grolsch beer bottles with those pull-down caps, any
  excuse for buying good beer...). When the pork has cooled enough to
  handle (I use latex gloves) pull it into thumb-sized chunks,
  discarding as much fat as possible. Pack roughly 3 pounds of barbeque
  into a large frying pan (I use a Number 10 size cast iron skillet).
  Dissolve 1 tablespoon of salt into 2 1/2 cups of warm water and pour
  it into the pan. Add about 12 ounces of your apple cider vinegar and
  red pepper sauce, turn the heat to medium, and let the liquid slowly
  simmer off, stirring frequently, until the sauce just barely oozes
  over the top of your spatula when you press down on the barbeque with
  it. Remove from heat, and congratulate yourself--you've just made a
  fine batch of Eastern North Carolina Style Barbeque.

      Title: BUBBA'S FAJITAS
 Categories: Mexican, Beef
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Beef skirt steak
      1 cl Garlic, chopped
      1 ts Cumin
      1 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
    1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      1 ts Liquid Smoke
      1 md Yellow onion, sliced in
           Rings
           Juice from 1 large lime
           Pepper to taste.
           Green and yellow peppers
           Guacamole
           Refried beans
           Mexican rice
           Warm flour tortillas
 
  Those self-appointed guardians of Texas cuisine, Bubba & Billy Joe,
  stopped by the other day and saw a request for fajitas so Bubba asked
  me to post his version. Serves 4 regular people or two hungry Texans.
  
   Trim fat from steak. Pound lightly to tenderize. Place meat in
  non-metallic container. Top with onion rings. Combine remaining
  ingredients. Pour over meat and onions. Cover and refrigerate
  overnight. (At this point he says to go out and just party, party,
  party ~- just forget about these tasty fajitas 'til tomorrow.) Next
  day - or whenever you find your way back home, remove the meat and
  onions, reserving the marinade. Separate the meat and onions. Place
  meat on grill, basting often with the marinade and turning often to
  prevent charring. You gotta do this on a grill - it's not the same in
  a broiler. Meanwhile, saute the onions in butter with some green and
  maybe some yellow peppers sliced into strips. When the meat's done,
  slice it into thin strips, cutting across the grain.
   Serve with homemade refried beans, Mexican rice, guacamole, picante
  sauce or salsa, sour cream, grated cheddar, your sauteed veggies and
  of course, warm flour tortillas to hold it all together. Bubba uses
  handmade tortillas he gets from a nearby restaurant. They're much
  better than store bought. (Hint: I think this recipe is even better
  with chicken, but don't tell Bubba I said that, 'cause he thinks real
  men eat beef, and only sissies eat chicken!)
  
  Thanks again Bill, Bubba and Billy Joe.

      Title: BUBBA'S PASTA WITH CHILES-N-CREAM
 Categories: Pasta, Chiles
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Fresh fettichini cooked
           Per package directions.
    1/2 c  Light whipping cream
      1 md Red onion julliened
           Your favorite chile(s)
           -julliened
      2 tb Olive oil
           Juice and zest of 1 lemon
      1 ts Salt
 
  While water for pasta is heating up to rolling boil, prepare onion and
  chile(s). Zest lemon. Roll around counter top while gently pressing
  down with your palm. Slice and squeeze. reserve zest and juice. Heat
  saut pan over med. high heat add oil. Add onion and saut till onion
  starts to turn translucent. (Water should be at a boil by now, so add
  pasta.) Add you chile and continue cooking till onions just start to
  caramelize. Add cream and cook approximately 2 more minutes. Add
  juice to cream mixture and 1/2 of the jest reserving rest for
  garnish. (This is the only tricky part-if you add the juice and the
  cream at the same time the cream will break or curddle but will not
  if the cream is cooked a bit first) Stir frequently, let sauce cook
  and thicken some. Pasta should be cooked. Drain well and toss with
  cream sauce add salt. You can use dry pasta but the timing will be
  off so adjust accordingly. As I said, very fast and cheap. The sweet
  of the onion and the heat of the chile plus the play against the
  cream and the texture of the chile against the pasta makes this dish
  superb. I hope you will enjoy. Walt - MM Chile-Heads

 Categories: Side dish, Jewish, Appetizers
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           -GRAMMIE'S KITCHEN
      1    Kishka
      4 c  Flour
    3/4 lb Suet; ground beef fat
      4 ts Salt
      2 ts Pepper
      2 lg Carrot; grated
      2    Onions; grated
      2    Celery; grated
 
  Combine fat and flour. Blend well. Add vegetables, salt, and pepper.
  Knead well. Stuff kishka loosely, like a turkey, only 3/4 inch thick.
  (Flatten it.) Lay stuffed kishka around in a roasting pan. Add cold
  salted water to cover. Cover pan and simmer on top of stove about 1
  hour. Slice and serve hot.
  
  MY NOTE: My Bubbe used to make this all the time. When she didn't have
  kishka, she used the loose skin from the turkey or chicken. We called
  it helzel. She stuffed that after she sewed into a tube. It was soooo
  good.

 Categories: Ethnic, Pasta
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     16 oz Noodle; cooked package/fine
      6    Eggs
    1/2 c  Sugar; to taste
      1    Margarine; melted
      1 c  Sour cream
      1 c  Cottage cheese
           Salt; to taste
    1/2 c  Raisins ; optional golden
 
  Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, drain
  well. Add the other ingredients and mix until combined. Put into a 9
  x 13 baking dish (greased) and bake at 350 degrees for an hour. Never
  fails.
  
  You can serve with fruit (fresh) or put pie filling over it. Try
  putting some sour cream on top. Enjoy You can incorperate the egg
  yolks and beat the whites for a very light texture. I sometimes add a
  bit of lemon juice.
  
  This is a very forgiving recipe. If you leave the sour cream, sugar
  and raisins out, you have a wonderful salt kugel to serve with
  chicken or beef.

      Title: BUBBIES CHICKEN SOUP
 Categories: Soups/stews, Poultry, Ethnic
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Large Fowl; 6 lbs
      1    Lg Kettle (10-12 qt.)
           -Water; cover and bring
           -to a boil
           -Prepare
      1    Lg Onion,
      3    Celery  stalks
      1    Parsnip,
      1 bn Carrot
      1 bn Dill
      1 bn Parsley; (a bunch of each).
 
  Put the chicken in the pot and cover with water. When the soup comes
  to a boil, skim off the top, add the veggies, turn down to a simmer.
    Keep the lid askew, and season to taste. It's wonderful and freezes
  well. Hint: put the dill and parsley in the mesh onion bag, to make
  for easier removal.
    Most would say to throw the veggies out, but I like to eat the
  carrots and the onion. The chicken is great in sandwiches or salad. I
  love it hot by itself, but you can put pieces in the soup when you
  serve. Add rice or noodles (cooked elsewhere) and of course there's
  always matzo balls. Enjoy,
  
  NOTE:  If you can't find a fowl, use a Perdue Oven Roaster, cut up. A
  butcher gave me this tip once and I now use it all the time. He cut
  it up too.

  The is a cute idea for one or several kids.  Using a large bucket as a
  Cauldron, fill it with water and add dishwashing detergent.(This is
  the magic potion).  Now you tell one child to be the "Wand Wizard".
  This child picks up his magic wand (actually a straw) and begins to
  blow into the mixture.  Next, you tell the color wizard, to begin
  dropping drops of food coloring over top the bubbles. Next, the paper
  wizard takes a piece of paper and gently lays it over the bubbles
  tapping gently. The magic works! The paper is covered with a color
  array of bubble prints. What is nice is that ALL age groups love this
  and the results are different everytime you do it.  Kids can take
  turns being different wizards each time.

    1/2 ts Vanilla
      8 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet,
           -- melted, cooled,

MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
      1 c  Cream, whipping
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Candied violets
      1 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet,
           -- melted, cooled
      1 tb Cocoa, unsweetened
 
       If you are using fresh chestnuts, cut an X on the flat side of
  each chestnut.  Place the chestnuts in a saucepan, cover with cold
  water and bring to boil.
  
  Cover and boil gently until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove the pan
  from the heat and let it stand for 15 minutes. Shell the chestnuts,
  removing both the hard outer shell and the inner brown skin. If
  you're using canned chestnuts, simply drain. Reserve 3 whole
  chestnuts for garnish. Puree chestnuts in a processor until very
  smooth. Add 3/4 cup of very finely powdered sugar, butter, Calvados
  and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Puree again until very smooth and fluffy.
  Add 8 ounces of melted chocolate and puree until very smooth. Line a
  4 cup round log-shaped mold or loaf pan with plastic wrap, pressing
  it down until smooth. Pour in the chestnut-chocolate mixture and tamp
  the mold to eliminate any air bubbles.  Smooth over the surface, and
  cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.
  
  To Garnish:
  
  Unmold log on serving plate, and carefully remove the plastic wrap.
  Whip the cream with 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla
  until stiff. Spread the cream evenly over all sides of the log,
  forming a barklike ridge here and there with a spatula or decorating
  comb. Drizzle thin lines of chocolate down the length of the log,
  using a paper pastry cone or fork. Roll the 3 reserved chestnuts in
  cocoa and arrange on the log lengthwise. Garnish with candied violets
  and refrigerate until serving.
  
  This log may be refrigerated for up to one week.

      1 pn Salt
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 tb Cream, heavy
    1/2 c  Butter
      2 c  Sugar, powdered
     30 ea Chestnuts, whole cooked
      2 tb Butter
      4 tb Cream, heavy
    1/3 c  Sugar, powdered

MMMMM--------------------MOCHA SILK FROSTING-------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Sugar, powdered
      3 tb Cocoa powder
      2 ts Instant coffee
  5 1/3 tb Butter
  1 1/2 tb Corn syrup
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 tb Cream, heavy
 
  Have ready: clean lint-free dish towel and cookie sheet larger than
  jelly roll pan. Preheat oven to 400; prepare 10"x15"x1" jelly roll
  pan by greasing it, lining bottom and sides with wax paper, and
  greasing wax paper.  Bring eggs to room temperature and separate. Mix
  flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside. Beat yolks until thick and
  pale. Gradually add 6T sugar, beating well after each addition.
  Mixture should fall in thick ribbon when beaters are lifted. Add
  vanilla and beat again. With clean dry beaters, beat egg whites until
  foamy. Gradually add remaining sugar, beating constantly, until
  whites stand in firm, glossy, moist peaks. Fold 1/3 whites into yolk
  mixture to lighten it, then fold remaining whites in too. Gradually
  fold dry ingredients into egg mixture; fold in gently but thoroughly.
  Spread batter evenly in prepared pan, making sure to get it into the
  corners. Put pan into oven immediately. Bake 10-12 minutes, just
  until cake is golden on top and tester comes out clean. Do not
  overbake. Remove from oven; working quickly, cover jelly roll pan
  FIRST with clean towel, then with inverted cookie sheet. Turn over
  pan, towel, and sheet to turn out cake. Remove jelly roll pan; peel
  off wax paper. Slide towel and cake onto counter; cake is wrong side
  up. Cut off any crisp edges, fold one end of towel over short end of
  cake, and roll cake in towel. Place rolled cake seam side down on
  wire rack or cookie sheet to cool completely. CHESTNUT BUTTERCREAM
  FILLING: combine sugar, egg yolk, salt, vanilla, and cream; beat for
  8 minutes at medium speed. Without washing beaters, cream butter
  until light. Add yolk mixture a little at a time, beating well after
  each addition. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating well after each
  addition. Set basic buttercream aside. Puree chestnuts with butter,
  cream, and powdered sugar. Stir chestnut puree into buttercream,
  blending thoroughly.  If necessary, thin with a little more cream to
  bring to very spreadable consistency. MOCHA SILK FROSTING: powder
  instant coffee by placing in plastic bag and crushing with rolling
  pin. Mix together sugar, cocoa, and coffee. Add remaining ingredients
  and beat for 1 minute at medium speed.  If necessary, add a little
  more cream to make frosting easy to spread. Unroll cooled cake,
  leaving it on towel; don't worry about the cake looking deflated, it
  will perk up soon. Spread 1/2 c frosting evenly over cake, all the
  way to the edges. Spread 2 c filling over thin layer of frosting,
  pushing generous amount into curved end. Roll up again, without towel
  but using it to help roll.  Place cake, seam side down, on cake plate
  or tray. Remove any excess villing from ends and seam edge.
  Refrigerate for 1 hour to firm filling. Trim and discard (or eat!) a
  thin slice from one end of chilled cake; cut and reserve wedge from
  other end. Spread a small amount of filling on top center of cake and
  press reserved wedge on it to make the "knothole." Frost entire cake
  with remaining frosting, building frosting up around sides of
  "knothole."  Do NOT cover knothold top! Work frosting as far under
  roll as possible. Repeatedly draw narrow metal spatula lengthwise
  through frosting to simulate rough texture of bark. Snip pieces of
  angelica into leaf shapes and cut glace cherries in half to make log
  decorations. Keep cake refrigerated until serving; it is much easier
  to slice when cold and firm. Before serving, surround cake with holly
  and cranberries.

      Title: BUCHTY (JELLY/JAM FILLED SWEET ROLLS)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 kg Instant flour
    100 g  Butter (melted)
     80 g  Sugar
      2    Egg yolks
     40 g  Fresh yeast
    3/4 l  Milk (lukewarm)
           Rind of one lemon
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Proof your yeast with 2 oz of the milk, bit of flour and sugar from
  the measured ingredients.
  
  When the yeast is ready, combine ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix
  until the dough won't stick to you finger when touched lightly. The
  recipe recommends setting some of the flour aside and adding it at
  need, I don't do this anymore because I usually end up adding a
  little bit more as it is. (different flours)
  
  This is where the recipe stops and you're expect to know what to do
  with it!
  :-) Mom had a bit of trouble understanding why I couldn't just make
  things when she bought me the exect same cookbook she uses (reprint).
  
  Let the rise in an oiled bowl, covered, until doubled. Dump out on
  lightly floured surface. Cut pieces of dough into lumps roughly the
  size you get if you scoop generously with a serving spoon. Sorry, I
  don't know how to do this one without showing you.
  
  Now. You take a lump of dough and flatten it in your hands until you
  can enclose the jam/jelly without getting the jam/jelly on any
  closing edges. I tend to put the dough on the table to start. I pick
  two opposite points and meet them at the center over the jam. I then
  gather the rest up to that point starting at the outside working in.
  the dough is fairly stick so it will seal fairly well. Pat it into a
  roundish shape and place seam down in a well oiled baking pan with 2"
  sides. As you place the rolls into the pan you want to swish them
  around to get oil on the sides so that they come apart when they are
  done.
  
  I use appricot jam, red/black current jelly, and plum butter. You can
  also make them with cream cheese filling, though I haven't tried that
  one yet.
  
  The rolles should be touching. I use a 9 x 13 pan and I get either 4
  or 5 bunnes across (depending on how many people are coming and how
  large I make them) a short side.
  
  Let raise a few minutes, brush tops with a bit of oil (I try to use
  any oil that pools around the buns from the "well oiled" part
  before/if I add any). and bake in 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.
  
  Remove from oven and brush tops again with oil (Sometimes I don't do
  this and they seem ok, I think it's supposed to soften the top) and
  let stand 5 minutes in pan, covered.
  
  Invert onto cooling rack to cool completely. The traditional way to
  serve this dictates sprinkling with icing sugar. I do for guests but
  not for us at home.
  
  Scatterbrained notes: I usually have more dough than the 9 by 13 pan
  will hold, so I put the rest in an 8" round cake pan. the rolls will
  expand to fill the space provided. If they are squished, they will
  bake higher but the sides will be very thin. Don't break apart until
  serving. Theses dry out if broken apart. Store on rack or plate (once
  cooled) covered with a clean dishtowel.
  
  This seems like an aweful lot of work, but it goes very quickly and
  the rewards are great.
  
  I've read this over twice and I don't think I've left anything out.
  
  Good luck

 Categories: Buckwheat, Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------AH-CHOO, T.D. IN MD.- 03/21---------------------
 
  Cooking Hints! When cooking whole kasha or whole buckwheat groats,
  it's unnecessary to use an egg to coat the kernels. The thin seed
  coating on whole buckwheat shields each kernel while it cooks,
  keeping particles separate and fluffy. Egg white works just as well
  as whole egg, when cooking fine, medium or coarse kasha. On these
  granulations of kasha, the thin seed coatings are cracked. Use an
  egg, egg white or egg substitute to 'seal' each particle and keep
  starch granules from sticking together. Follow package directions.
  
   For fluffy kasha and tender groats, boiling hot liquid gives the best
  results. Broth-homemade, canned or from a bouillon cube or powder-
  adds more flavor than water.
  
   Cooking times vary for fine, medium, coarse or whole kasha. Follow
  times on package, keep heat low, and don't lift the lid to peek!
  Buckwheat flour is a baker's delight. Make tender pastry crusts and
  rolled cookies. If you rework dough, it won't be tough--because it's
  gluten-free. For the same reason, pair buckwheat flour in cakes,
  muffins and yeast breads. Without some gluten for support, these
  might collapse.

      Title: BUCKWHEAT CREPES
 Categories: Breads, Desserts, Breakfast
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
      1 c  Milk
      3    Eggs
    1/2 c  Buckwheat flour
    2/3 c  White flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 tb Melted butter
 
  Buckwheat pancakes are great, but here's something a little more
  elegant: buckwheat crepes. Serve them with melted butter and cinnamon
  sugar. TO MAKE BATTER IN A BLENDER, put all ingredients into a
  blender jar in order given, and blend briefly at medium speed. Stop
  and scrape down the sides of the blender jar; then blend for another
  5 seconds or so. Pour out the batter into a bowl, cover and let rest
  for 1 hour before using. To make batter by hand, beat the eggs
  slightly, add milk, water, salt and melted butter, then gradually
  whisk in flours. Pour the batter through a strainer and let sit for
  1/2 hour before using. To cook crepes, melt a little butter in a
  crepe pan and cook. As buckwheat has an enormous capacity to absorb
  liquid, you might find it necessary to thin the batter with more milk
  or water.

      Title: BUCKWHEAT CREPES WITH ONIONS~ APPLES~ & CHE
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     18    Buckwheat crepes; up to 20
      6 lb Yellow onions
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Salt; more to taste
           Black pepper
  1 1/2 lb Tart green apples; about 4,
           -use pippins or Granny Smith
      3 tb Calvados
      8 oz Sharp cheddar cheese; grated
 
  Prepare the Buckwheat Crepes and set aside.
  
  Peel the onions, cut them in half lengthwise, and then slice them
  thickly. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of butter in
  each of two large non-stick pans, and divide the onions between them.
  Sprinkle about 1/2 teaspoon of salt over each batch and cook the
  onions on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they are golden
  brown. This will take about 45 minutes. Add black pepper to taste.
  
  Meanwhile, peel the apples, cut into wedges, and slice the wedges
  crosswise. When the onions are lightly browned and much reduced in
  volume, consolidate them into one pan. Add the Calvados to the onions
  and stir quickly to deglaze the pan. Add the sliced apples, and a
  touch more salt if needed. Continue cooking, stirring often, until
  the liquid is entirely gone, the onions are a deep caramel color, and
  the apples are tender.
  
  Spoon 2 to 3 rounded tablespoons of the onion mixture across the
  center of a crepe, then sprinkle about 1/2 ounce of grated cheese
  over it. Roll the crepe loosely over the folling and place it seam
  side down on a buttered baking sheet. Continue filling and rolling
  crepes until all the onions and cheese are used up. You should have
  at least 16-18 filled crepes. Reserve any leftover crepes for another
  use.
  
  Cover the crepes loosely with a piece of aluminum foil, and bake them
  in a 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes, or until they are hot through
  and the cheese is completely melted. If you have filled the crepes
  earlier and kept them in the refrigerator for a while, adjust the
  oven time upward by at least 5 minutes.
  
  Serve the crepes at once, with a green salad, and Cranberry-Jalapeno
  Sauce.

 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12 lg Buckwheat Crepes
      1 lb Portobello or shiitake
           -mushrooms
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Butter
      2    Cloves garlic; minced
           Salt to taste
      3 lg Yellow onions; chopped
      1 ts Olive oil
      2 lg Russet potatoes
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Flat-leaf parsley; coarsely
           -chopped
           Fresh ground black pepper
      4 oz Swiss or Fontina cheese;grat
 
  Clean the mushrooms and cut them in 1/2-inch dice. Heat a tablespoon
  of olive oil and a teaspoon of butter in a large non-stick skillet
  and stir the minced garlic in it for a minute. Add the mushrooms and
  a little salt, and saute for 10-12 minutes, until they are tender and
  starting to sizzle.
  
  In another skillet, cook the chopped onions in the remaining olive
  oil and butter, with a dash of salt, until they are soft and turning
  golden.
  
  Peel the potatoes and cut them in 1/2-inch dice. Combine them in a
  saucepan with the white wine and enough water just barely to cover
  them, as well as 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Bring the water to a boil,
  lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pan tightly, and cook for 10-15
  minutes, until the potatoes are just tender. Remove the lid and
  continue cooking gently, stirring once or twice, until the liquid is
  reduced and thickened to a sauce. Stir in the sauteed onions and
  mushrooms, as well as chopped parsley and fresh-ground black pepper
  to taste.
  
  Allow the potato-mushroom mixture to cool slightly, then fill the
  crepes. Spoon 2-3 rounded tablespoons of filling across the center of
  each crepe, then sprinkle a litle grated cheese over the filling
  before rolling or folding the crepe loosely over it. You should have
  about a dozen filled crepes.
  
  Cover the crepes loosely with aluminum foil and bake in a 350 degree
  oven for 10-15 minutes, or until they are hot through and the cheese
  is completely melted.

      Title: BUCKWHEAT FLATBREAD
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Buckwheat flour
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Water
 
  "Buckwheat flour is available in health food and specialty stores. It
  has a musty, earthy flavor which gives an interesting twist to this
  simple, traditional flatbread-style cracker. It goes well with fruit
  and cheese. In the food processor or in a large bowl, combine the
  flours and salt. In a slow stream, stir in enough of the water to
  form a soft, but not sticky, dough.
  
  Remove to a well-floured surface or pastry cloth and knead lightly.
  Cut the dough into 6 equal portions and roll each piece into a large,
  thin circle, approximately 1/16 inch thick and 8 inches in diameter.
  Prick each circle all over with the tines of a fork.
  
  To cook, gently place the circles, one at a time, on a hot griddle or
  saute pan. Cook over medium heat until pale brown spots begin to
  develop on the underside of the cracker, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the
  cracker to cook the second side. Continue flipping in this manner
  until the cracker feels dry and crisp. Remove to a rack to cool. If
  upon cooling the cracker remains slightly pliable, you may return it
  to the pan for further cooking, or place in a preheated 350~F. oven
  for a few minutes, until fully "dried out." Yield: 6.
  
  VARIATIONS: For a crunchier cracker, add 1/3 cup buckwheat groats and
  increase the water slightly.
  
  Buckwheat has a strong flavor. According to your taste, you may wish
  to increase the all-purpose flour and decrease the amount of
  buckwheat.

 Categories: Buckwheat, Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  Eating buckwheat may postpone your hunger pangs. According to USDA
  study and other research, buckwheat will keep glucose levels in check
  better than other carbohydrates.
  
  Buckwheat gives you over 20% more fiber than oatmeal. The total
  dietary fiber content of buckwheat is largely soluble fiber. This is
  the type of fiber that many nutritionists and medical experts believe
  to be significant in helping to lower cholesterol levels when
  combined with a low fat diet.
  
  Buckwheat is one of the best plant sources of protein. If you're
  eating less meat, this can be especially important. Eggs are the
  standard used to size up protein quality. Buckwheat as over 80% of
  the protein quality of eggs--with none of the cholesterol or fat.
  Plus, buckwheat is rich in lysine, one of the amino acids that is in
  short supply in most grains.
  
  Buckwheat is a fruit, not a grain. As such, it's wheat-free and
  gluten-free.  This is healthful news for those with celiac disease and
  other less severe wheat allergies.

      6    Anchovey paste
     10 tb Extra virgin olive oil
      6 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Worchester sauce
      2 tb Red wine vinager
      4 tb Dijon mustard
      3 oz Egg substitute
 
  Mix all except egg subs well. Let stand at room temp. Wash 2 LARGE
  heads romaine lettuce inside leaves. Spin out water and put in towel
  in frig to crisp. Cut 9 slices of Sour dough french bread and butter
  both sides. Sprinkle garlic powder on one side & cut into bit sizes.
  Toast garlic croutons in 300 deg oven until crisp, about 25 minutes.
  Let cool to room temp. Grate a wedge of parmessan cheese, or cut into
  cubes & throw into blender. Assemble: Place cold crisp lettuce in
  large bowl. Pour egg sub in slowly while tossing. When well coated
  repeat process with dressing. When well coated repeat process with
  cheese & then croutons. Serve in large salad bowls with extra cheese
  on top with fresh ground pepper. Even my teenage kids eat this. By
  adding a broiled chicken breast to each serving, along with remaining
  sour dough bread, this becomes an entire meal.

      Title: BUDGET SAVING HINTS
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  (1) Buy whole chickens and cut it up.  You'll save 30 ~ 40 percent
  over pre-cut chicken.
  
  (2) For beef and pork always buy the family pack. Again about a 15%
  savings. (3) Pasta !!! Cheap and really versitile. Always have lots on
  hand. Lasagna can be especially good. Make a big one, cut it into
  meal size individual portions and freeze them.
  
  (4) Rice !!!  Again cheap and you can do a lot with it. Take 2 cups
  of rice steam, when done scramble 3 eggs, throw in some green onions
  and any left over chicken scraps (when butchering a chicken there's
  always little bits and pieces kicking aroud), add the rice, some soy
  sauce and fry it on up.
  
  (5) Stir fries.  Lots of inexpensive veggies and some meat.
  
  For 4 and 5 you don't need a wok just a big fry pan. A wok is nice
  but not really needed.
  
  (6) Always have something like Kraft Dinner, etc. on hand for those
  nights you really don't fell like cooking for yourself. As a bachelor
  or bachelorette sometimes it's a real drag to cook but for health
  reasons you should eat something.
  
  (7) A microwave is a must.  You can pick up a little one for no more
  than $80 dollars.  They really help for defrosting and heating
  leftovers

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
           Salt
           Pepper
      4 lb Veal shanks,
           -cut into 2-inch pieces
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      4    Celery stalks, chopped
      3    Carrots, chopped

      3    Garlic cloves, minced
  1 1/2 c  White wine

    1/2 c  Fresh parsley, chopped
      2 tb Grated lemon rind
      4    Garlic cloves, minced
 
  Braising transforms the fibrous toughness of less expensive veal
  shanks to melting tenderness while dissolving their gelatin to a
  luxurious sauce. As a bonus, the centre of the bone is filled with
  delicious marrow, which can be scooped out with a small spoon.
  
  In plastic bag, combine flour, 1 ts salt and 1/2 ts pepper. Add a few
  pieces of veal and shake; repeat with remaining veal. In Dutch oven,
  heat oil  over medium-high heat; brown shanks in batches. Remove
  shanks and set aside.
  
  Add celery, carrots, onions and garlic; cover and cook over low heat
  for about 8 minutes or until onions are softened. Return veal to pan.
  Stir in wine, chicken stock, sage, rosemary, 1/4 ts salt and bay
  leaf; bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer, stirring
  occasionally, for 60-70 minutes or until veal is tender. Stir tomato
  paste into pan; cook, uncovered, for about 15 minutes or until sauce
  is thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Discard bay leaf.

  rind and garlic. Sprinkle Gremolata over individual servings.

  fennel, cloves, star anise, and black pepper.
  
  Cut ribs into small sections; trim fat. in large saucepan, cover ribs
  with cold water. Add onion and bay leaf. Bring to boil; simmer for
  35-40 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain, discarding onion and bay
  leaf.

  ginger, five-spice powder and garlic. Bring to boil; reduce heat and
  simmer for 10 minutes.
  
  Arrange ribs in single layer in 13x9-inch baking dish. Spoon sauce
  over top. Bake in 350F 180C oven, turning twice and basting
  occasionally, for 30-35 minutes or until ribs are glazed and sauce is
  thickened and sticky. 6 servings for $7.76 CDN [Mar/95]

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Jim Vorheis
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Toasted fine bread crumbs,
           -approximately
           For the budin:
      2 c  Corn kernels*
    1/2 c  Milk
      5 tb Unsalted butter
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Sea salt, or to taste
 
  Heat the oven to 300 F.  Place a heavy baking sheet on the lower rack
  of the oven.  Butter a 1-quart baking or souffle dish and sprinkle
  with the bread crumbs. Set aside.
  
  Put the corn and milk into a food processor and process for 10 to 15
  seconds or until reduced to a textured puree. Beat the butter until
  creamy and gradually add the corn and the eggs, one by one, beating
  after each addition.  Add the sugar and salt.
  
  Pour the mixture into the prepared dish and bake until the mixture is
  firmly set and beginning to brown around the edges - about 35 minutes.
  
  Either serve from the dish or carefully unmold onto a serving dish.
  
  * Starchy field corn works best, ears of corn left intact that have
  been picked a few days earlier, for the starches to heighten, can be
  used.

    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      4 ts Ketchup
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Mustard
      2 ts Horseradish
 
  The beauty of this recipe is that accurate measurements can go out the
  window. Add more or less of the spicings that you like. Toss it all
  in and mix it up. Patty up and grill. Serve like a regular hamburger.
  Tip: If you have a grill that tells the temperature, keep it down! Or
  let the coals die down some. Don't put lean buffalo meat in the
  flame. ( Buffalo is a lean red meat and is some what dry so you have
  to cook it slowly to keep the juices in.) These burgers were taste
  tested by the usually critical teen-age crowd. They asked for
  seconds. I take that as an impressive OK.

  half at the joint in 1/4 cup of butter until golden brown. Allow the
  wings to cool before frying a second time, yes they are fried a
  second time so if you are a calorie watcher you can stop now. They
  can be fried the first time a day ahead. Before frying the second
  time mix the Tabasco and Hot Pepper sauce with the melted butter. Fry

  reddish color. Serve with chilled celery sticks and blue cheese

      2 md Onions
     30 oz Rotel tomatoes; diced (3 can

  1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
  1 1/2 ts Paprika
      3    Cl Garlic
      1    Fresh lime
 
  Recipe by: Wayne Preston Allen I found the bison at a health food
  store - that's a good bet for you, too. The New Mexico chili powder
  might be had from one of a number of mail-order resources if you
  don't have a local source. The Rotel tomatoes are hot, so you can
  substitute reqular tomatoes to cool it a little (but it's gonna be
  hot anyway!)
  
  Brown the bison meat. Bison is lean and clumpy, so add a little oil
  and break it up as you brown it. Add finely chopped onions and
  garlic. When onions are clear, add tomatoes and spices. Add water to
  barely cover, and simmer until meat is tender. Add chopped poblanos
  for last 20 minutes of simmer, and stir in lime juice before serving.
  You're really gonna be surprised!

  Buffalo Style Chicken Salad offers zesty flavor and a variety of
  textures and temperatures. Skinned and boned chicken breast halves
  are coated with a spicy wheat germ mixture, broiled, sliced and
  arranged on top of several different kinds of lettuce. Celery sticks
  and fat free blue cheese dressing add to the authenticity. Each bite
  of Garden Turkey and Rice Salad features wheat germ and cooked brown
  rice, crunchy vegetables and lean turkey breast. Freshly squeezed
  lemon juice added to bottled fat free Ital ian dressing zips up the
  flavor. Serve over salad greens, sliced tomatoes' toes or a
  cantaloupe half, or spoon into pita pockets. Any way you serve it,
  this salad's a winner.
  
  Combine wheat germ and seasonings; set aside. Combine water and egg
  white. Dip chicken into egg white mixture and then into wheat germ
  mixture, coating chicken thoroughly. Place on broiler rack sprayed
  with no stick cooking spray. Broil 3 minutes; turn. Broil an
  additional 24 minutes or until juices run clear. Slice into strips
  and serve over mixed greens with celery sticks and salad dressing.
  Makes 2 servings.

      Title: BUGOGI - KOREAN BEEF DISH
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Beef tenderloin,
           -sliced very thin
      2    Cloves fresh garlic, crushed
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      1 tb Sesame oil
           Black pepper good sprinkling
           Roasted sesame seeds
           -(also a good sprinkling)
      1    Green onion, finely chopped
      2 tb Soy sauce
      3 tb Water
 
  In a glass or plastic bowl, mix everything together. Cover and
  refrigerate for 1-2 days.  (You can cook immediately, but of course,
  it won't taste as good.
  :-) )
  
  In a skillet, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium-high to
  high heat.  Cook the beef slices, turning until meat reaches desired
  degree of doneness (about 1-2 minutes).
  
  Serve with rice and green vegetables.
  
  NOTES:  The recipe says 'serves four,' but then again, I ate a batch
  of this myself without complaining too much. I guess it depends on
  how hungry you are and what else you're serving. ;-)
  
  I also usually omit the sesame seeds, since neither my SO nor I like
  them. Hasn't killed me yet.
  
  I got this recipe from the Atlanta Journal/Constitution, near
  Christmas (it was part of a list of dishes that the paper's
  contributors served at their own Christmas dinners; they had a Cuban
  writer, someone Russian, etc. I do not recall the name of the South
  Korean woman whose recipe this is, alas).

  but thouroughly... Cover and refrigerate 12 to 24 hours mixing
  occasionally...
  
  2)      Remove from the `frige at least 1 hour before cooking and

  time... or until the meat is no longer pink... *or*
  
  2b)     Drain the beef before cooking (reserving the marinade), being
  careful not to squeeze the juices from the meat, and barbecue the
  strips on a hot grill for 25 to 40 sec. per side or until they are no
  longer pink. (Slices should not touch each other)

      Title: BULL FROGS (SLUSH)
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 1 Gallon
 
      3 cn (12 oz ea) Frozen Limeade
      3 l  Bottles 7-Up soft drink(+/-)
     12 oz Vodka (+/-)
           Green Food Coloring (Opt)
 
  Mix the limeade, 1 liter of the 7-Up and the vodka together, mixing
  well. (Vodka and 7-Up may be adjusted to taste, but the overall
  mixture should look 'slushy' as opposed to 'watery'.) Add green food
  coloring if desired. Pour the loose slush into a container, cover,
  and place in freezer (an old 1 gallon plastic ice cream bucket works
  wonderfully for this). This mixture can be stored in the freezer for
  many months.
  
  To serve, use an ice cream scoop and fill cocktail glass halfway full
  with frozen slush.  Fill the glass the rest of the way full with 7-Up
  soft drink (from the remaining liter bottles); stir. The result
  should be a light green 'slush' drink that tastes quite a bit like a
  Margarita. Refreshing on a warm day, and good to just have on hand
  for last minute company.

      Title: BULLS EYE CHEESECAKE (KH)
 Categories: Cheesecake, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     32 oz Cream cheese, room
           Temperature
    1/4 c  Sour cream
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Almond extract
    1/4 ts Salt
      4 lg Eggs
    2/3 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Dark brown sugar
      1 ts Powdered (not granulated)
           Instant coffee
      2 ts Unsweetened cocoa powder
    1/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
 
  Adjust rack 1/3 up from bottom of oven & preheat to 350 Carefully
  butter 8x3" cheesecake pan all the way up to the rim & including
  inside rim itself or cake will stick to rim as it rises & will
  therefore not rise evenly. Will also need a large pan (for hot water)
  to place cake pan in while baking; the larger pan must not be as deep
  as the cheesecake pan, & it must be wide enough so it will not touch
  the sides of cake pan. Set aside. In large bowl of electric mixer
  beat cheese until soft & smooth, frequently scraping sides of bowl
  with rubber spatula & beaters themselves with finger to be sure
  cheese is uniformly smooth. Beat in sour cream, then vanilla & almond
  extracts, salt & then eggs, one at a time, scraping bowl occasionally
  & beating after each addition until incorporated. Remove bowl from
  mixer. You will have 6 cups of mixture. Place half (3 cups) in
  another bowl that is large enough to allow you to stir in it. Add
  sugar to one bowl & brown sugar to the other. With rubber spatula for
  each bowl stir ingredients for 1 minute until sugar has dissolved &
  mixtures have thinned out.
  
  To dark mixture, add instant coffee & through a fine strainer, the
  cocoa. Stir until coffee & cocoa have dissolved & there are no
  visible specks of either. Now to form design. You have a scant 4 cups
  of each mixture. The two will be placed alternately in pan. Each
  segment will be scant 1 cup of mixture. Use two 1 cup glass measuring
  cups, one for the dark & one for the light. It does not matter which
  color you use first. Pour either directly into middle of the prepared
  pan. It will spread out by itself to cover bottom of pan. Then pour
  same of the other mixture directly into middle of the first. This
  will spread out by itself also. Then use first color again, right in
  the middle. Continue until you have used all of both batters or four
  additions of each mixture. Now, handle pan very carefully in order
  not to disturb design. Place cake pan in larger pan & pour hot water
  into larger pan about 1 1/2" deep. If the larger pan is aluminum add
  about 1 tsp. cream of tartar to hot water to keep pan for
  discoloring. Carefully transfer to oven & bake 1 1/2 hours. Then
  remove cake pan from hot water & set aside to cool. During baking the
  top of the cake will darken to a rich honey color & will rise up to &
  sometimes above the top of the pan; during cooling it will sink down
  to its original level. When bottom of cake has reached room
  temperature the cake is ready to be unmolded. Dip bottom of pan in
  wide fry pan of boiling water for 10-15 seconds before unmolding.
  After dipping bottom of pan in water, dry pan, cover it with flat
  plate or board, carefully hold cake pan & board firmly together &
  turn them over. If cake doesn't slip out of pan easily, bang pan &
  platter or board against work surface. Remove pan. Sprinkle crumbs
  over cake ( this will become bottom & crumbs will keep it from
  sticking to plate) cover with serving plate, turn it all over again,
  leaving cake right side up. Refrigerate. Will slice best of you dip a
  knife into a deep pitcher of very hot water before making each cut.
  The hotter the water, the better.

      1 oz Almonds
      2 dr Kewra essence or 1 drop
           - itar kewra

  Prepare khoa (dried fresh whole milk) by boiling 2 pints Jersey milk
  or 960 mls buffalo milk briskly in a heavy pan (karahi). Stir all the
  time until it dries up (takes about half an hour) and see that the
  fire burns well, as slow heating turns the khoa creamy in colour. The
  finished product should be white if properly prepared. Keep aside and
  allow it to cool.
  
  Add castor sugar (or substitute powdered sugar) to khoa and mix
  thoroughly. Then cook for 10 minutes, taking care not to let the
  mixture stick to the bottom. Mix minced almonds and pistachios; stir
  for 2 to 3 seconds, remove from the heat and allow it to cool; add
  kewra essence or the itar.
  
  Invert a thali or a tray and grease its back; put the mixture over it
  and roll out as neat and aas straight as possible. Decorate with
  silver leaves. When it cools down and becomes firm, cut into diamond
  pieces. Keep in an air-tight tin.

  In 1954, in Miami, FL, James McLamore and David Edgerton built the
  first Burger King Restaurant. By 1991 more than 6,400 Burger King
  outlets could be found in fourty countries and all fifty states. That
  gives this burger giant more than $6 billion in sales each year,
  making it the 2nd largest fast-food chain. (McDonald's is the
  largest.)
       For many, the favorite item on the menu is a flame-broiled
  hamburger conceived by the partners on a business trip from Orlando
  to Miami in 1957. Dubbed the "Whopper," this sandwich is
  overwhelmingly popular; figures show that Burger King sells more that
  540 million annually, or nearly 2 million a day. And with more that
  1,023 different combinations of the eight-or-so ingredients,

      Title: BURGER MIX
 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Dry chickpeas
    1/2 c  Dry soybeans
    1/2 c  Dry lentils
    1/2 c  Yellow split peas
    1/2 c  Brown rice
    1/2 c  Rolled oats
    1/4 c  Whole wheat bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
  1 1/2 tb Baking soda
        x  Seasonings of your choice
           (see note)
 
  Put the ingredients 1-2 at a time in a blender, turn the blender on,
  and RUN FOR COVER (this is pretty noisy <g>). When everything is in
  powdered form, combine in a tupperware container and store in the
  fridge. Makes 4 cups of mix.
  
  To make burgers, combine 1 c. burger mix and 2/3 c. HOT liquid (see
  note 2) and let sit for 15 minutes. On a plate, form into 3 thin
  patties. Use a spatula to move patties onto a nonstick-sprayed
  skillet and cook on both sides until lightly browned.  Serve with
  your favorite burger fixins.
  
  Note - Seasonings:  You can use the herbs and/or spices of your
  choice, or consider using a dry soup mix run through the blender
  (I'll bet onion would be good). Also, try a dry FF salad dressing
  mix. Or a veggie boullion cube run through the blender.  Other
  suggestions: onion powder, garlic powder, lemon pepper, basil, etc.
  
  Note - Liquids:  Try 1/3 c. water and 1/3 c. barbeque sauce - combine
  in bowl and nuke until hot , add to dry mix (note that burgers made
  with barbeque sauce will brown more quickly, so watch them!). Or try
  half water, half tomato juice, or half water and half white wine or
  marsala. Try to make sure that your liquids and seasonings have
  compatible flavors.
  
  Other suggestions:  The possibilities here are endless
  :)
  
  Oriental:  Burger mix with a little soy sauce in the liquid and some
  fresh ginger added to the mix, maybe a dash of rice wine.
  
  Spanish:  Cumin, red pepper, chili powder, or a dry taco seasoning
  mix.
  
  Indian:  Curry powder added to the mix.
  
  Wine/garlic:  Chopped garlic added to the mix, half water and half
  white wine for the liquid.
  
  Potpourri:  Make a batch of plain, unseasoned burger mix and add
  whatever seasonings strike your fancy as you're mixing it up! No need
  to commit to just one flavor for the whole batch!

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Oil, olive
      1 c  Wine, red, dry
      1 ts Garlic, minced
      1 lb Bread, French, quartered
 
     Put a half cup of oil in a small sauce pan with the cup of red
  wine. Add the garlic and stir over medium heat bringing it all to a
  boil to eliminate the alcohol. When heated thoroughly, the mixture is
  done.
  
     Take a loaf of French bread and slice it lengthwise in half so you
  have a top half and a bottom half. Then take the two halves and slice
  them in half again vertically so that you have four pieces
  altogether. (two tops and two bottoms)
  
     Use a brush to paint your French bread pieces with the liquid
  mixture (generously).  Broil the pieces of bread about 6" from a
  broiler (liquid painted side up) for about 5 minutes and serve.
  
     If it's going to be a little while before you can serve the bread,
  you can wrap it in foil and keep it warm.

  into the pot and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring with a wooden
  spoon, until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Scrape the
  cooked mixture into a bowl and let cool. When cool, cover and place
  in the refrigerator to chill. Not more than 30 minutes before
  serving, mix remaining white sugar together with brown sugar. Divide
  the custard between 4 soup bowls and sprinkle the surface with all
  the sugar. Wipe the bottom of a 6-inch heavy skillet to remove any
  loose debris and place over high heat. When the skillet is very hot,
  use it to burn the surface of the custard. Carefully press the
  surface of each custard with the bottom of the hot skillet. The sugar
  will quickly burn and there will be a lot of smoke. Quickly wipe the
  bottom of the skillet after each custard is burnt and replace on the
  heat for a minute to get it hot. Don't refrigerate custards after
  burning and serve within 30 minutes.

      1 lb Powdered sugar, sifted
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Burnt Sugar Syrup
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Melt sugar in a skillet over low heat, stirring occasionally, until it
  turns into an amber-colored liquid. Turn off heat, and carefully add
  boiling water (mixture will bubble madly). Return the caramel to low
  heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until the sugar and water are
  thoroughly mixed and no lumps of sugar remain. Set aside to cool to
  room temperature.

  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. For the meringue layers, pulse the almonds in
  the food processor until coarsely ground. Place them on a baking pan
  and toast for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until golden.
  Cool and combine with the sugar and cornstarch. Reduce oven to 300F.
  Whip the egg whites on medium speed with the salt until white and
  opaque. Increase speed to maximum and whip in remaining sugar.
  Continue whipping until egg whites hold a firm peak. Fold in extracts
  and toasted almond mixture. Pipe batter on paper-lined pans with a
  pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tube to make three 10-inch
  disks. Bake at 300F about 30 minutes, until crisp but not completely
  dry. Cool layers on pans. FOR THE FILLING, place the sugar and lemon
  juice in a saucepan and stir well to combine. Place on medium heat
  and stir occasionally until the sugar melts and caramelizes. Add the
  milk carefully (the caramel will splatter) and return to a boil,
  stirring to dissolve any hardened caramel. Whisk yolks in a bowl with
  orange zest and whisk half the boiling milk into them. Return
  remaining milk to a boil and whisk in yolk mixture, continuing to
  whisk until thickened. Strain into a bowl and cool. Beat butter with
  paddle on medium speed until soft and light. Beat in custard cream
  and beat filling smooth. FOR THE GLAZED ORANGES, combine the orange
  juice and gelatin in a bowl. Bring the apricot preserves to a boil
  over low heat, stirring occasionally. Add the orange mixture and
  return to a boil, reducing slightly. Strain and cool slightly. Halve
  and slice oranges thinly. Dip orange slices in glaze and place on a
  pan lined with plastic wrap to set. To assemble, trim layers to an
  even 10-inch diameter and place one on a cardboard. Spread with 1/4
  of the filling. Repeat with another layer and another 1/4 of the
  filling. Top with last layer and mask cake with another 1/4 of the
  filling. Use the remaining filling to make a border of rosettes on
  the edge of the cake and a circle of rosettes in the center. Press
  the sliced almonds against the side of the cake and fill in the
  center circle with them. Arrange orange slices on the rosettes.

  putting the Kahlua in after all the others have been blended and then
  mix in the Kahlua seems to keep it from frothing up. Serve in a tall
  glass with a straw. Top with whipped cream if desired, but not

      Title: BUSY DAY COBBLER
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter (or margarine,
           -if you must)
    1/2 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Milk
      1 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
     13 oz Tart cherries
           -(one normal U.S. can)
      2 tb Sugar (to sweeten
           -and thicken; use less
           -or more as needed)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Drain cherries, saving liquid.
  
  Cream butter and sugar together.  Alternately add in milk and sifted
  dry ingredients.  Pour into a buttered and floured casserole dish.
  Top evenly with cherries. Sprinkle sugar on top and cover with saved
  liquid/juice. Bake 45-50 minutes.
  
  The batter will expand and surround the cherries so they're evenly
  mixed throughout the cobbler.  The juice will congeal to fruity and
  pudding-like. Serve warm topped with cream, milk or ice cream. (I
  prefer milk). If any is left, it's good cold, too.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An extremely quick cherry cobbler dessert -- This recipe came from
  a PTA recipe collection from my Aunt's school a number of years ago.
  It's not a true, classic cobbler, but I think it's better. My
  favorite dessert!
  
  *  As the name implies, this is a very quick recipe to make.
  Depending on how soft the butter is to start with, or whether or if
  you use a food processor (I don't, but it should work) this recipe
  takes only 5 to
       10    minutes to mix.
  
  *  You can use any unsweetened canned fruit for this recipe. You can
  also use frozen fruit, by thawing it before adding to the pan.
  Berries or peaches are standard substitutes. Yesterday I made one
  with crushed pineapple.  I used brown, rather than white sugar atop
  the fruit. It tasted very much like pineapple upside down cake
  (though the appearance was a bit different).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, I've been making this since I was about 8 or 9.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  From "Sukiyaki, the Art of Japanese Cooking and Hospitality", by
  Fumiko. Edited and copyrighted by Scotty Guletz. Hawaii and Pacific
  Books. No date given.
  
  This is an interesting little book (booklet, really) that must have
  come out just after WW II.  It was written by a Japanese lady living
  in Hawaii and tends to emphasize how genteel and hospitable the
  Japanese culture is++probably a good idea considering the historical
  context of the book.
  
  The recipes are all pretty basic but look good and call for real
  Japanese ingredients that I'm sure were either scarce or unavailable
  on the Mainland at the time. Shoyu is, of course, soy sauce. I can't
  believe that "gourmet powder" could be anything but MSG. Though it
  doesn't call for "fiddleheads" by name, I can't imagine what else
  "fern shoots" could be.

      Title: BUTTER COOKIE ANGELS - COUNTRY LIVING HOLIDAY
 Categories: Holidays, Cookies
      Yield: 36 Cookies
 
  3 1/2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  (1 stick) butter, softened
    1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
  1 1/3 c  Sugar
      2 lg Eggs
           Royal Icing (recipe follows)
           Yellow food coloring
           Edible gold dust (opt.,
           -see Note)
           Small gold dragees (opt.,
           -see Note)
 
  1. In medium-size bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt.
  
  2. In large bowl, with electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter and
  shortening until well blended. Add sugar and beat until light and
  fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each.
  
  3. With mixer on low speed, add half of flour mixture to butter
  mixture and beat just until blended; add remaining flour mixture and
  beat until soft dough forms. Shape dough into 3 equal balls; wrap and
  refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
  
  4. Heat oven to 350'F. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Cut 2 pieces of
  waxed paper the same size as the baking sheets. Lightly flour waxed
  paper and roll out one ball of dough between paper to 1/8 inch
  thickness. Remove top piece of waxed paper. Using 6-inch angel-shaped
  cookie cutter, cut out as many angels as possible from dough, leaving
  1/2 inch between cookies. Remove all trimmings and press together.
  Invert waxed paper with angels onto greased baking sheet and peel off
  waxed paper. Reroll trimmings between waxed papers and repeat cutting
  and inverting angels to fill second baking sheet. If making cookies
  for ornaments, pierce a small hole with a drinking straw about 1/2
  inch from top of each cookie.
  
  5. Bake cookies 8 to 10 minutes or until golden. Cool 5 minutes on
  baking sheets, then remove to wire racks and cool completely before
  decorating. Repeat rolling, cutting, and baking with remaining balls
  of dough and trimmings.
  
  6. To decorate cookies, prepare Royal Icing. Divide icing between 2
  bowls. Cover one bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Using just a few
  drops yellow food coloring, tint the other bowl of icing very pale
  yellow.
  
  7. With pastry brush, paint the front of each cookie with a thin
  coating of tinted icing, being sure not to cover up pierced hole; let
  dry and paint again. When icing has dried, brush cookies with gold
  dust, if desired. Pipe decorative designs on front of cookies using
  reserved white icing and pastry bag fitted with a small (#1) writing
  tip. If using small gold dragees, carefully place onto cookies before
  icing dries. If making cookies well in advance, store in airtight
  container and freeze.
  
  Royal Icing: In large bowl, with electric mixer on low speed, beat 2
  1-lb packages confectioners' sugar, 6 large egg whites (if cookies
  are going to be eaten, use meringue powder instead of egg whites and
  follow package instructions for Royal Icing; see Note), and 1 t cream
  of tartar until mixed. Increase speed to high, beat until very thick
  and fluffy-about 6 minutes. Cover tightly with plastic wrap to
  prevent dry- ing until ready to use. Makes 4 C.
  
  Note: Meringue powder can be purchased wherever cake-decorating sup-
  plies are sold or by calling Wilton Industries at (800) 772-7111.
  Gold dust and dragees may be purchased from the Chocolate Gallery,
  (212) 675-2253. Both sources carry decorating tips, pastry bags,
  parchment paper, insulated baking sheets, and other baking supplies.

      Title: BUTTER COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
    1/2 c  Butter (unsalted),
           -at room temperature
    1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
  1 1/2 c  Flour, white
      1 lg Egg
      1 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
 
  Beat the butter with the sugar.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat
  until you get a uniform mixture.  Mix the flour and baking powder and
  gradually blend them into the mixture. When you're done, you should
  have a rather sticky dough.
  
  Shape the dough into balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Roll them in
  sugar and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving about an
  inch of space between cookies, so that they don't stick together when
  they expand.
  
  Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes. Remove from
  oven, let them cool for a while, and start eating right away.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  After reading the ingredients on a can of imported Danish butter
  cookies, I thought: "Hey! I can do this myself!", so I developed the
  following recipe. It doesn't resemble the original too much, but
  considering that the cookies don't stay around for more than two
  days, and that even my mother liked them, they must be good! Yield:
  Makes 2-3 dozen cookies.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: BUTTER KRUMKAKES
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 ea Eggs
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter
  1 3/4 c  Sifted all purpose flour
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Beat eggs until light.  Add sugar slowly, beating until pale yellow.
  Melt butter and add slowly.  Stir in flour and vanilla until well
  blended. COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:
    You will need a krumkake iron, which fits over a 7-inch burner
  surface (gas or electric).  Always use moderate heat.
    For each baking period, the iron should be lightly rubbed at the
  beginning with unsalted butter, but after this initial greasing,
  nothing more is required. The batter needs a preliminary testing, as
  it is quite variable, depending on the condition of the flour, so do
  NOT add at once all the flour called for in the recipe. Test the
  batter for consistency by baking 1 teaspoonful first. The iron is
  geared to use 1 tablespoon of batter for each wafer, and it should
  spread easily over the whole surface but should not run over when
  pressed down. If the batter is too thin, add more flour.  Should any
  batter drip over, lift the iron off its frame and cut off the excess
  batter with a knife run along the edge of the iron.
    Cook each wafer about 2 minutes on each side or until barely
  colored. As soon as you remove it from the iron, roll it on a wooden
  spoon handle or cone form, and, when cool, fill it.

      Title: BUTTER OR SUGAR CAKE ON A BAKING SHEET
 Categories: Ethnic, German, Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           CAKE DOUGH
    3/4 oz (20g) yeast
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 pt (285ccm) lukewarm milk
  1 1/8 lb (500g) flour
  2 1/2 oz 3 1/2 (75-100g) sugar
      3    Drops baking essence
           Bitter almond flavor
      1    Pinch salt
  1 3/4 oz (50g) butter, margarine,
           Or lard, or 3 tb oil
           TOPPING
  1 3/4 oz 4 1/2 (50-125g) butter
  2 1/2 oz (75g) sugar
      1    Packet vanillin sugar
  1 3/4 oz (50g) almonds (blanched and
           Chopped) or Hazelnuts
           (blanched and chopped)
 
  FOR THE CAKE DOUGH:  cream the yeast with 1 tsp of the sugar and 5
  tbs of the milk. Sieve 2/3 of the flour into a large mixing bowl,
  make a well in the center and pour in the yeast; cover with 1/4 in
  (1/2 cm) layer of flour. Distribute the sugar, flavoring, and melted
  lukewarm fat on the flour around the well; take care that they do NOT
  come in contact with the yeast. As soon as the yeast shows large
  cracks, begin to stir all the ingredients together, starting from the
  middle, and gradually adding the rest of the milk. Beat the dough
  with a strong wooden spoon until it shows bubbles.  Knead in the rest
  of the flour; if the dough should be sticky add a little more flour,
  but not too much the dough should remain soft. Leave in a warm place
  until the dough has doubled in size. Knead thoroughly again and roll
  out on a greased baking sheet. Place a folded piece of greaseproof
  paper against the dough at the open end of the baking sheet. FOR THE
  TOPPING:  Either flake the fat evenly over the cake or melt it and
  brush it over.  Mix the sugar with the vanillin sugar and nuts and
  sprinkle evenly over the cake. Leave in a warm place until the cake
  has doubled in size and then bake. OVEN: preheat for 5 minutes at
  very hot, bake at moderately hot. BAKING TIME: about 15 minutes

      Title: BUTTER PECAN ROLLS
 Categories: Desserts, Breads
      Yield: 18 Servings
 
      1    Cake compressed yeast
           (1 envelope may be used)
    1/4 c  Lukewarm water
      1 c  Milk, scalded
    1/4 c  Shortening
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
  3 1/2 c  Sifted all purpose flour
      1    Beaten egg
           Filling
      2 tb Melted butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 ts Cinnamon
           Topping
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/4 c  Butter
      1 tb Light corn syrup.
    1/3 c  Pecans
 
  I think this recipe originally was from a Better Homes and Gardens
  Cookbook, but I can't be sure - I've been making these for over 20
  years. The recipe can be doubled successfully (yielding 2 sheet cake
  pans or 32 rolls).
  
  Soften yeast in lukewarm water.  Combine next 4 ingredients; cool to
  lukewarm. Add 1 cup of the flour; beat well. Beat in yeast and egg.
  Gradually add remaining flour to form a soft dough; beat well. Brush
  top lightly with soft shortening; cover and let rise in warm place
  until double (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Punch down; turn out on lightly
  floured surface and divide dough in half. Roll each piece in 12 x 8
  rectangle.
  
  FILLING:
  
  Brush each rectangle with 2 tablespoons melted butter. Combine 1/2 cup
  sugar and 2 tsps cinnamon; sprinkle half over each rectangle.
  
  Roll each rectangle as for a jellyroll, beginning with long side; seal
  edge. Cut each roll in eight 1 1/2-inch slices. TOPPING:
  
  In each of two loaf pans or one sheet cake pan or 2 cake pans, mix
  1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter and 1 tablespoon light corn
  syrup. Heat slowly, stirring frequently till blended. Remove from
  heat. Spring
      1/3    cup pecans in each pan.
  
  Place 8 rolls cut side down in each pan.  Cover; let rise in warm
  place until double (35 to 45 minutes). Bake in moderate oven (375
  degrees) for 25 minutes or until done. Cool 2 or 3 minutes; invert on
  rack and remove pans. Makes 16 rolls.
  
  (If you leave the rolls in the pans to cool longer than a couple of
  minutes, they will stick as the caramel topping sets up. You can
  either place them back in the oven for a couple of minutes to heat up
  the caramel or try a warm water bath.  I find it easier to turn them
  out quickly - so don't wander too far after removing the rolls from
  the oven.)

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           -ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      2 ts Yeast
    3/4 c  -Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
    3/4 c  Milk
      2 tb Olive oil
      4 c  Flour; to 4 1/2; plus 4 bd
      2 ts Kosher salt

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1    Buttercup squash
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 lg Spanish onions; very thinly
           -sliced
      2 cl Garlic; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Cinnamon
      1 tb Ginger; freshly grated
    1/2 ts Nutmeg; freshly grated
    1/2 ts Allspice
           Kosher salt; and
           Pepper; to taste
      1 c  Romano cheese
      1 lb Loose spinach; stemmed and
           -washed
 
  To prepare the DOUGH:  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
  dough hook, add the yeast, warm water and sugar; stir with a fork.
  Allow to stand for 10 minutes or until the yeast starts to bubble and
  foam (PROOF). NOTE: Make sure that the water is NOT hot.
  
  Add the milk, olive oil and 3 cups of the flour and salt on low
  speed; mix to combine.  Continue to add flour 1/2 cup at a time,
  kneading the dough in between at medium speed until the dough pulls
  away from the sides and feels smooth, soft and, when indented with
  your finger, springs back nicely. If you feel the dough is too sticky
  you could add more flour, but it is better on the sticky rather then
  the dry side.
  
  Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a  towel and allow to
  double in bulk.  It will take 1 or two hours.
  
  For the FILLING: While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Set
  the oven a 375 degrees.  Oil a baking sheet. Wash and cut the squash
  in half and remove the seeds from the center. Drizzle the flesh with
  1 T of olive oil and turn the squash cut side down on the baking
  sheet. Bake in a preheated oven for 30 or 40 minutes or until the
  flesh is soft. Remove from the oven and set aside.
  
  In the meantime, in a saute pan heat the remaining T of olive oil
  until hot.  Add the onions and cool over low heat, stirring
  occasionally for 30 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
  Place the onions in a mixing bowl.  Using a large spoon scoop the
  flesh from the squash and add it to the onions.  Stir in the heavy
  cream. Season with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, kosher salt,
  and pepper. Mix all the ingredients together and set aside until cool.
  
  When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and turn into a
  floured board or counter.  Divide the dough in half. Lightly grease a
  9x13 casserole baking dish, Using a rolling pin, roll half dough out
  to form a rectangle large enough to fit in the prepared pan and all
  the way up the sides.  The dough may spring back when you work it but
  perceiver and make sure it fits up the sides. Sprinkle half the
  romanao cheese over the bottom of the dough.  Spoon the cooled
  filling into the bottom of the pan; smooth over the entire pan. Place
  the spinach leaves over the squash mixture. This will seem like a lot
  of filling but it will collapse while it cooks. Sprinkle the spinach
  with the remaining cheese and season to taste.
  
  Set the oven at 350 degrees,  a , roll out the remaining piece of
  dough just large enough to fit on the top of the rectangle. Ease the
  dough onto the top of the filling bringing the bottom edge over the
  top. Pinch the seams together firmly. With a sharp knife make 4 large
  holes on the top, spacing evenly.
  
  Transfer the pie to the preheated oven and bake for 30 or 40 minutes
  or until the crust is golden brown. Remove from he oven and cut into
  squares. This pie is best eaten warmed through.
  
  ELAINE'S NOTE:  I would do this with phylo dough...sheets on the
  bottom and on the top.  Less work and I bet it would be just as
  delicious. In fact I may try this at Howard's house this
  Thanksgiving...

      Title: BUTTERCUP SQUASH~ BARNARD INN STYLE
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ea Medium buttercup squash
    1/4 c  Butter
      1 x  Salt
      1 x  Nutmeg
    1/4 c  Vermont maple syrup
      2 ea Large Cortland apples
     12 ea Cranberries
      1 x  Sugar syrup (one part sugar
      1 x  To one part water)
 
  Blanch cranberries in sugar syrup, being careful not to boil. (They
  shouldn't burst.)  Cool and leave in syrup for one hour or refrigerate
  overnight. Slice the apples into 1/4 inch (approximately) slices and
  spread on buttered tray. Cut one medium buttercup squash (unpeeled)
  into eight pieces and steam until the inside is soft, while the shell
  remains somewhat firm. Scoop out slightly cooled meat and mash. Whip
  the mashed squash with about one-fourth cup of butter, nutmeg, and
  salt to taste, and about one-fourth cup of maple syrup (depending on
  dryness of the squash) to achieve a consistency that will hold its
  shape. Squeeze through a piping bag (or substitute) and mound onto
  the apple slices. Cortland preferred because it doesn't discolor
  quickly.)  Place a blanched cranberry on top. Just before serving,
  heat on buttered tray in preheated 350ø oven for 10-15 minutes.
  These may be prepared ahead and refrigerated until ready to heat and
  serve. by Chef/Owner Sepp Schenker From In Season, a publication of
  the Vermont Department of Agriculture, Food and Markets

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5    Oranges; large, juicy
      4 tb Sugar
      6    Egg yolks
      2 tb Sherry
      1 ts Rosewater; optional

      1 c  Heavy cream
           Crystallized violets;for
           -decoration, optional
 
  To prepare the Orange Shells: Hold the orange so the stalk (or navel)
  is at the base and using a small knife cut off the top about two
  inches down. Scoop out all the flesh, being carefully not to break
  the skin. This can be done quite easily with a teaspoon. Using a pair
  of scissors, cut off the stalk that remains in the bottom, wash the
  orange and set it aside (the top can be discarded). Repeat this
  procedure with three more of the oranges. Grate the peel off the
  remaining orange and then squeeze the juice from this orange into the
  bowl. Place the flesh you have extracted from the other oranges in
  the sieve and squeeze the juice in the same bowl. Mix the juice with
  the sugar and egg yolks in a double boiler over low heat. Beat with a
  wire whisk until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the top of the
  double boiler and cool in a bowl of cold water while you continue to
  stir; then add the sherry and rosewater. Remove the bowl from the
  cold water. Cut the butter into 1-inch cubes and mash it into the
  mixture piece by piece. Add the orange peel. Whip 3/4 of the cream
  and fold it into the mixture. Pour the mixture into the four orange
  shells and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Before serving, place
  three crystallized violets on the top of each orange; whip the
  remaining cream and force it through a pastry tube in a curly pattern
  around the top edges. SERVES:4

      2 c  Rice, basmati
      4 tb Butter
 
  "The darker (the redder) the saffron colour, the better the quality.
  It usually comes from Spain, but the best, really expensive stuff, is
  grown in Kashmir, where I went to see it growing. There are many
  different grades. Watch out for fake or dyed saffron. Buy it from a
  reputable source. To use it in a recipe, I roast it in a cast-iron
  pan until it's crisp to draw out the colour, then crumble it lukewarm
  milk and let it sit for three to four hours."
    Place saffron in small, dry, hot pan over medium heat about 1
  minute or just until fragrant. Crumble into milk.
    Fill large pot with about 13 cups water; add salt and bring to boil.
    Meanwhile, place rice in medium bowl and cover with cold water.
  Immediately drain rice through colander. Wash and drain two more
  times.
    When water is boils, add rice and stir once; bring to boil. Cook 5
  minutes; rice should be slightly hard in the centre.
    Drain in colander and place in ovenproof dish. Drizzle saffron milk
  over rice, tossing over a couple of times very gently. Divide butter
  into four pieces; place over rice.
    Cut pieces of aluminium foil 2 inches larger than rim of dish;
  place on top of dish; place lid on foil. Bake in preheated 300F oven

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 -1/2 quart
 
      2 c  Heavy Whipping Cream
      2 c  Milk (I used the 1% stuff
           -that was on sale)
      2 tb Cold water
      3 ea Rennet tablets
      1 c  Sugar
      4 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Cashew nuts (broken ones are
           -fine)
      6 ea Trick-or-treat size
           -Butterfinger candy bars
    3/4 c  French Toast Crunch
           -breakfast cereal
 
  Dissolve rennet tablets in water (swirl the bowl until dissolved), set
  aside.  Combine cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla in saucepan and heat
  stirring constantly to 110 degrees.  Pour into the ice cream freezer
  machine, then add the rennet tablet solution and operate the churn
  for five or ten seconds to mix well.  Turn off the churn and let that
  cool for a while.
  
  Take the butterfinger bars (still in their wrappers) and bludgeon
  them with the flat handle of a knife (I used a heavy-handled bread
  knife) to crush the contents well.  Open the wrappers and dump/scrape
  the crushed contents into your food processor (with metal blade). Add
  the cashews and the breakfast cereal, and pulse the food processor
  until the dry ingredients are just broken up and well mixed.
  
  By now the custard should be set and cooled off somewhat.  Turn on
  the ice cream maker's refrigeration switch and, after a few minutes,
  the churn. When the ice cream mixture is just starting to freeze,
  pour in the crushed dry ingredients and continue to freeze to the
  desired consistency. This will vary depending on your freezer, but
  for me it takes about 25-35 minutes.
  
  This is a really scrumptious combination, and could be varied by
  changing the flavoring ingredients with other stuff you have around.

      Title: BUTTERFLIED LEG OF LAMB WITH ROASTED VEGETABL
 Categories: Lamb/mutton, Bar-b-q, Main dish, Formatted
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Oil. olive
      3    Lemons; juiced
      4    Garlic cloves; minced
      3 tb Marjoram; chopped
      2 tb Rosemary; chopped
      6 lb Lamb, leg of; boned and
           -butterflied
           Salt; to taste
           Pepper,  black; to taste
      5 lg Potatoes, baking; cut into
           -6 lengthwise wedges each
      4 md Zucchini; halved lengthwise
      4    Pepper, bell, red; seeded,
           -halved lengthwise
           Lemon; wedges for serving
 
    Combine 1/3 cup of the olive oil, the lemon juice, garlic, 2
  tablespoons of the marjoram and the rosemary, and marinate the lamb
  in this mixture for 24 hours. Bring the lamb to room temperature.
    Heat broiler and broiler pan.  Remove the lamb from its marinade,
  scraping off as much of the herbs and garlic as possible. Season with
  salt and pepper to taste. Place it flat on the boiler pan, the
  thickest part at the back of the pan, and broil for 15 minutes. Turn
  the lamb and broil for 13 to 15 minutes longer. Remove from the
  broiler and let stand 10 minutes. Note:  This is also an excellent
  cut for the grill; grill until a slight bit of pink remains in the
  center, either over _low_ direct heat, or smoke-roast over indirect
  heat.
    Let roast 'rest' for 10 minutes before carving, and then slice off
  8, 1/2 inch thick slices for the current meal, and then wrap, chill
  and refrigerate the remainder of the meat for use later in the week
  (see recipes for Deviled Lamb, Lamb Hash, Couscous-lamb Salad,
  Roasted Pepper, Lamb and Watercress Focaccia Sandwiches, and Lamb
  Pita Sandwiches with Tahini Sauce).
    Combine the potatoes, the remaining 2 tb. olive oil (or slightly
  more if desired) and salt and pepper to taste in a large roasting
  pan. Place the potatoes in the oven at the same time as the lamb goes
  under the broiler. Roast, tossing once, for 25 minutes.
    Add the zucchini and peppers, tossing them with the potatoes, and
  roast until the potatoes are tneder when pierced with a knife and the
  zucchini and peppers are just tender, 12 to 15 minutes more. Season
  with additional salt if necessary, pepper and the remaining
        1    tb. marjoram.
    Reserve 10 potato wedges for hash later in the week.
    Mound the remining vegetables on a platter and serve with the
  sliced lamb and lemon wedges.
    Note:  This recipe is for an oven with a single heating element that
  allows for simultaneous broiling and roasting. In an oven with
  seperate heating elements for oven and broiler, roast the vegetables
  first at 45 F., then broil the lamb.  Reheat the vegetables in the 10
  minutes that the lamb stands before carving.

      Title: BUTTERFLY COOKIES
 Categories: Chinese, Cookies, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Package won ton wrappers
      1 c  Powdered sugar
           Oil for deep frying
 
  Fixed these guys last night.  Good stuff!  Quite simple to do. I also
  tried using granulated sugar and cinnamon as well as the powdered
  sugar. All were equally good.
  
  Yield: About 80
  
  PREPARATION: Cut each won ton wrapper into 2 rectangles. Lay one
  rectangle on top of the other to form a double thickness. Make three
  1/2-inch slits in the center, lengthwise. To form a bow, pull one end
  through the middle slit.
  
  COOKING: Deep fry butterflies until golden, about 1 minute or less.
  Drain on paper towel. Sift powdered sugar over both sides. Cool.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES: These keep several weeks in air-tight containers. [Fat
  chance! They didn't even make it through the next day! S.C.]
  
  COMMENTS: These can also be made from egg roll wrappers but they're
  three times as large.  I prefer using won ton wrappers because I
  think their mini size makes them more attractive.

      1 pk Active dry yeast
      3    Eggs, beaten
    1/4 c  Water
  4 1/2 c  Flour
    3/4 c  Scalded milk
    3/4 c  Butter, melted
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Shortening
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Soften yeast in warm water with 1 tbs of sugar. Set aside. In another
  large bowl combine milk, shortening, sugar, and salt. Cool to
  lukewarm then add yeast mixture and mix well. Add eggs. Measure in
  flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well until dough is smooth, soft and
  elastic, and no longer sticky. Knead lightly on floured surface. Form
  into ball. Place in warm bowl, cover and let rise in a warm, draft
  free place until doubled; about 2 to 2-1/2 hours with regular yeast.
  Punch down, knead lightly and divide into thirds. Roll each third
  into a 12 inch circle.  Brush with melted butter. Cut into 12
  pie-shaped wedges and roll (starting at wide end ending at the point)
  each wedge into a crescent. Brush each crescent with melted butter.
  Place on greased baking sheet and let rise until very light (about an
  hour). Bake at about 375 degrees for about 12 minutes or until light
  golden brown. Experiment with your oven, as the temperature can vary
  between 350 and 400 degrees.  If the rolls burn on the bottom before
  turning light brown, the oven is too hot.

  Cousin Walter and those who dined with him looked forward to this
  well-chilled light beet soup on warm days. Milk, plain yogurt, or a
  combination of the two can be used instead of buttermilk.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Add the
  onions and celery, and saute over medium heat for 10 minutes, or
  until the celery is soft and golden. Add the celery leaves and cook
  for 2 minutes longer. Add the remaining ingredients except the
  buttermilk and dill. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for
  20 minutes, or until the beets are tender. Cool. Stir in the
  buttermilk and dill.  Chill thoroughly. From: The Tabasco Cookbook.

 Categories: Breads, Cookies
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
      4 c  Flour
      2 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 tb Sugar
    2/3 c  Butter, softened
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
    1/4 c  Butter
 
  Sift flour with baking powder, soda, salt, and sugar. Cut in 2/3 cup
  butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add buttermilk, stirring
  until dry ingredients are moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly
  floured surface; knead lightly 4 or 5 times.  Roll dough to 1/2 inch
  thickness; cut with a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter. Place biscuits on a
  lightly greased baking sheet. Brush tops with 1/4 inch melted butter.
  Bake at 450 F for 8 minutes or until golden brown.
  
  Note:  When cutting biscuits, never twist the cutter; that will seal
  the edges and prevent proper rising. If the cutter is not cutting all
  the way, consider a new cutter.

      Title: BUTTERMILK CHEESE & BACON BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Buttermilk
      2 tb Butter
      2    Eggs
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 tb Sugar
    3/4 ts Salt
      3 c  Bread flour
  2 1/2 ts Yeast (1 pkg Red Star)
           Add at Mix Bread beep:
    2/3 c  Bacon bits (real bacon,
           -cooked then chopped, not
           -canned or artificial)
    2/3 c  Shredded cheese
 
  This recipe is a combination of Donna Gorman's Bacon/Cheese Bread and
  her Buttermilk Cheese Bread (cookbook III). I'd made the bacon/cheese
  bread and it was good, but it was a rather dense, low loaf. When I
  saw the buttermilk cheese bread recipe, I decided to make a few
  modifications and combine the two recipes ... the result is a tall,
  utterly delicious loaf!
  
  I then tried it closer to her recipe and, instead of adding
  bacon/cheese at the mix bread cycle, I added 1 cup of shredded cheese
  at the beginning. This loaf almost brushed the top of my Hitachi! It
  was HUGE!
  
  I don't know why these rise so well ... I did warm the buttermilk in
  the microwave for about 1/2 minute and the baking soda is unusual. I
  may try adding a small amount of baking soda to some other recipes
  and see what the result is.
  
  Anyway ... this is now one of our favorite breads!  A loaf is baking
  right now.

      Title: BUTTERMILK DRESSING WITH HERBS & GREEN PEPPER
 Categories: Sauces, Seasonings, Salads
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    2/3 c  Buttermilk
    1/3 c  Olive oil
  1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Mayonnaise
      3 tb Garlic chives; snipped
      1 ts Fresh minced tarragon
      2 ts Coarsely ground green
           -- peppercorns
    1/2 ts Salt (approximately)
    1/4 ts Sugar
 
  Whisk buttermilk, olive oil, lemon juice and mayonnaise in a small
  bowl until mixture is smooth and well blended. Blend in remaining
  ingredients. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate
  for at least 30 minutes.  Correct seasoning and allow to come to cool
  room temperature before serving.
  
  Yield: About 1 1/2 c. dressing.
  
  Belsinger and Dille write: "This tangy dressing goes well with all
  kinds of salad greens and is especially good with cucumbers and
  summer-ripe tomatoes.  Pour it over steamed and sliced new potatoes
  for a delicious warm potato salad.  Coarsely crack the peppercorns in
  a mortar and pestle or use the flat side of a chef's knife to crack
  them on a cutting board. The dressing will keep, in a tightly covered
  jar, in the refrigerator for about a week."

 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 10 Cups
 
MMMMM----------------------MIX INGREDIENTS---------------------------
      2 c  Buttermilk powder
      8 c  Flour, all-purpose
    1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
      8 ts Baking powder
      4 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------PANCAKE INGREDIENTS-------------------------
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 c  Pancake mix
      1 c  Water, or more
           -as needed
 
  MAKE PANCAKE MIX:  Sift the ingredients together well. Store in a
  container with a tight-fitting lid.
  
  MAKE 10 PANCAKES:  Mix ingredients until blended together. Let it
  stand five minutes. Cook some pancakes. Eat and enjoy.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A make-it-yourself mix for buttermilk pancakes -- This recipe
  comes from the "More Make-a-mix Cookery" cookbook put out by HP
  Books. The premise of this book and its predecessor, Make-a-mix
  Cookery is that you can save time and money by making your own mixes
  for every stage of dinner planning. It seems to work. Yield: 10 cups
  of mix of mix.
  
  *  Use the mix within 6 months of when you make it.
  
  *  The pancakes made from this mix aren't as sweet as those made from
  Aunt Jemima mix, but they are good. You can always add sugar, of
  course.
  
  *  Although we haven't tried this (yet), you could probably vary the
  recipe by using a different type of flour to make, for example, your
  own buckwheat pancakes.
  
  *  If you can't find buttermilk powder in your local grocery store,
  try a bulk food store.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes to make the mix if you have the ingredients.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Yield: 16 Cakes
 
    1/2 c  Buttermilk; to 3/4 cup
      2 tb Butter; melted
      1    Egg
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking soda

    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Beat the buttermilk, butter and egg lightly in a mixing bowl. Mix the
  flour, baking soda, sugar and salt and add them all at once to the
  first mixture, stirring just enough to moisten the flour. Lightly
  butter or grease a griddle or frying pan and set over moderate heat
  until a few drops of cold water sprinkled on the pan form skittering
  globules. Pour about 1/4 cup per pancake on the griddle; bake until
  the cakes are very bubbly on top and the undersides are lightly
  browned. Turn with a spatula and brown the other side.  Place
  finished cakes on a heated plate in a very slow (200 F) oven until
  ready to serve.

      2 cn (16 oz) pear halves in light
           -syrup, drained
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Vegetable oil, preferably
           -canola oil
  3 1/2 c  Sifted cake flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
  1 3/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Buttermilk
      1 tb Pure vanilla extract
      1 tb Grated lemon zest
      2    Large eggs, separated
      2    Large egg whites
 
  In a food processor or blender, puree pears.  Transfer to a
  medium-sized saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring almost
  constantly, until reduced to 1 cup, 10 to 15 minutes. (Adjust heat as
  necessary to maintain a gentle simmer).  Transfer to a large bowl and
  let cool completely.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 10-inch tube pan or coat
  with nonstick cooking spray.  Dust with flour, shaking out excess.
  
  In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Cook, swirling the
  pan, until the butter turns a light, nutty brown, about 60 seconds.
  Pour into a small bowl, stir in oil and set aside.
  
  Sift cake flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda into a
  medium-sized bowl and set aside.  Add 1 1/2 cups of the suger,
  buttermilk, vanilla, lemon zest, egg yolks and the butter-oil mixture
  to the reserved pear puree and whisk until smooth.
  
  In a clean mixing bowl and with clean beaters, beat the 4 egg whites
  until soft peaks form.  While continuing to beat, slowly add the
  remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff, but not dry, peaks form.
  
  With a rubber spatula, gently fold the dry ingredients into the pear
  puree mixture alternately with the beaten whites, making three
  additions of the dry ingredients and two additions of the beaten
  whites. Turn the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake for 40 to 45
  minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out
  clean. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to
  cool, right side up.
